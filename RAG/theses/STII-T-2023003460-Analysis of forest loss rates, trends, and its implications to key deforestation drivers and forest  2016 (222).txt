ABSTRACT
“Tropical deforestation is among the significant processes of land cover change. In monitoring
deforestation, remotely sensed data played a crucial role in understanding the extent of forest
depletion. However, in tropical countries like the Philippines, generation of spatially explicit
forest cover data are hindered by multiple imagery sources, varying scales and resolutions,
undisclosed methods of mapping and different forest classes and definitions used. In this study,
the main objectives were to identify the trends of forest cover change in the Philippines using
Landsat processed data from years 2000-2012 and to validate its causes in the field. The data
were enhanced and further analyzed to make sure that forest pixels fall within acceptable tree
cover and non-forests features were excluded. Then post-processing was done to produce net
change ranking and annual forest loss rates, trends and correlations. The said step was also
done per forest cover type to provide detailed insights on forest cover change. The results
showed that MIMAROPA had the highest forest loss rate (2,864.10 ha/year), followed by
Cagayan Valley (2,550.82 ha/yr) and CARAGA (2,522.56 ha/yr). Zamboanga Peninsula region
had the highest mean aggregate net change (or percent net change) of -7.18% with mean forest
loss rate of 1,294.40 ha/year followed by CALABARZON (-3.41% with mean forest loss rate
of 1,098.54 ha/year) and CARAGA (-3.16%). However, only CARAGA had the significant
Positive trend of forest loss (r = 0.69, p-value < 0.05). In the provincial level, Palawan had the
highest forest loss rate (2,380.02 ha/yr), followed by Agusan del Sur (1,693.86ha/yr) and
Cagayan (1,018.23 ha/yr). Zamboanga Sibugay had the highest mean aggregate net change (-
8.94%, mean forest loss rate = 233.05 ha/year) followed by Zamboanga del Norte (-8.10%,
mean forest loss rate = 812.02 ha/year and Albay (-4.98%, mean forest loss rate = 99.81
ha/year. Open forest (secondary growth) was the most dynamic forest type with national mean
forest loss rate of 613.19 ha/yr and mean aggregate net change of -2.75%. Likewise, Agusan

del Sur (0.68), Tarlac (0.67) and Davao Oriental (0.65) were the top provinces which had

significant increasing trend of forest loss (p-value < 0.05) in open forest. The overall accuracies
for Landsat processed data were 86.48% for loss and 92.26% for gain, but this varied greatly
per biogeographic region. On the other hand, key indirect drivers such as forest product
harvesting (logging and timber poaching; weighted score = 14.75), and agriculture (kaingin
and forest to rubber plantation conversion; ws = 18) were identified as main reasons of
deforestation in General Nakar, Quezon and Kabasalan, Zamboanga Sibugay, respectively.
Meanwhile, agriculture (kaingin) and forest product harvesting (logging and timber poaching)
were tied in Siocon, Zamboanga del Norte (ws = 13.5). However, biophysical drivers such as
landslides and drought served as push factors to intensify the said proximate causes as observed
in General Nakar and Kabasalan. Economic-market driven factors (limited livelihood
opportunities and high demand for wood) were identified as the main indirect driver of forest
decline in three sites. Specific events such as global financial crisis, policy changes, log bans,
cutting and logging permits issuance were identified as another underlying causes of forest
decline in validated sites. On the other hand, in relating Landsat derived data to various forestry
statistics, it was found out that annual lumber production (r = 0.66) and roundwood production
(r= 0.62) were significantly and moderately correlated to forest loss while CBFM (r = -0.59)
areas had negative association to forest loss (p-value < 0.05). In this research, areas with
significant forest change were identified and key deforestation drivers were analyzed with the
aid of the Landsat processed data. This study demonstrated that remote sensing data coupled
with socio-economic based ground validation for selected sites further enhanced our

understanding of the complex processes of deforestation.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background of the Study

Tropical forests are among the highly diverse and important terrestrial ecosystems of
Earth. Though it only covers less than ten percent of the world’s total land area, it houses the
largest terrestrial repository of biological diversity (Lasco, 2008). There is no doubt that these
ecosystems provide various benefits to humanity through global and cycle regulation and
mitigation of climate change (Foley et al., 2005; Bonan G., 2008). It is home not only to several
species but to upland indigenous people. In this modern age, tropical forests contribute to
various processes that humanity still not fully understand (Terborgh, 1992).

Complete coverage, accurate and repeated measures of tropical forests and land cover
variables are heavily relied upon by natural resource conservation and planning, biodiversity
assessment and carbon accounting activities (Hayes et al., 2008). Therefore, creation of
updated maps and its statistics is crucial for natural resource management. However in the
Philippines, most forest maps are hampered by different forest definitions, several sources of
imagery, varying scales and resolutions, undisclosed methods of mapping, and oftentimes
restrictions in obtaining the input or output data. In addition, most of these maps are scarce and
are very hard to produce in a national scale. These results in the difficulties of replicating,
analyzing and verifying these forest maps.

‘The Landsat Program is the longest continuous record of changes on the Earth’s
surface. Recently, it has been used as a main remote sensing research input for global forest
resource assessment by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization from 1990 to
2005 (FAO and JRC, 2012). Aside from forestry purposes, it is also a good resource of

agriculture, geology, regional planning, education, mapping, and global change research

(USGS, undated), Thus, it is considered as among the most used remote sensing data in the
field of global forest monitoring.

In the recent years, the availability of freely available global processed data regarding
forest cover change may help researchers to analyze and interpret them locally. This is
exemplified by global forest cover change of Hansen et al. (2013) and forest and non-forest
map of Shimada et al. (2014). In this study, the primary data will be that of Hansen et al. (2013)

since it used Landsat 7 as its inputs.

1.2 Objectives

This research aims to analyze and assess forest loss rates and trends in the Philippines
using Landsat satellite derived data and to integrate it to the assessment of key deforestation
drivers in three selected municipalities in the Philippines. Its specific objectives are the
following:

1) To examine and assess forest loss rates and trends in the Philippines using Landsat
derived data in the regional and provincial level.

2) To investigate and evaluate key deforestation direct drivers and its underlying factors
in three selected municipalities, in conjunction with forest loss rates and trends of
Landsat derived data.

3) To integrate the derived forest cover and loss trend data to forestry statistics and identify

possible determinants of forest loss.

1.3 Significance of the Study
The outputs of this research will explore the capability of Landsat processed data for
forest cover monitoring and provide results that will verify existing forest cover maps. Any

consistent patterns of change regarding spatial extent of Philippines forest cover will be

substantial in assessing the past and recent forest management practices, especially in the
country’s reforestation and other forest rehabilitation efforts.

In addition, this study is among the researches to use a processed data from a global
dataset and integrate it to the assessment of key deforestation drivers. Thus, any outputs that
will be generated from this study will compensate to nationwide land cover mapping in the
country that usually takes years to finish. As mentioned in the objectives, this research will also
contribute in assessing relevant key deforestation drivers occurring on the sites visited. This is
relevant and vital in line with Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation

Plus (REDD+) project implementation in the Philippines.

1.4 Scope and Limitation

Deforestation in this study is defined by the observed forest loss in the pixel of Landsat
processed data, Forest degradation is not covered in this study since it does not necessarily
result to a decrease in forests area but rather results to reduced forests structure and function.
The area of interest in this study will focus on the forest cover of the Philippines from 2000-
2012 as indicated in the definition of forest classes in vectors and treecover threshold used in
this study (85% and up). The primary data will be Landsat 7 processed products based from
the main outputs of Hansen et al. (2013). Validation on selected areas, which showed prominent
change in forest cover, will be done through the conduct of key informant interviews, focus
group discussions, secondary data gathering and site visits. Higher resolution geospatial data
will also be used in conjunction with the Landsat processed data to validate those areas. Site

visits of change pixels are limited due to time, accessibility and security constraints.

1.5 Theoretical Framework of the Study

The main theory behind this research revolves around deforestation phenomenon as a
land cover change issue of environmental science. As discussed by Guppy (1984),
deforestation can be compared to a multilayer cake wherein its obvious causes were located in
the outer surface (Figure 1). These factors were deemed as direct causes (e. g. population
growth, increased land demand for agriculture, growing demand for forests products, livestock
grazing and settlement). The factors beneath the upper layer constitute the more powerful
deforestation causes that ultimately control the more obvious direct factors. For example the
rising demand for forest products like wood logs as construction material is pushed by global

economic markets, mostly from industrialized countries. In the case of increased demand for

land for agriculture, social factors such as population growth induces government policies to
Promote migration and resettlement programs in forest frontiers, thus allowing the migrants to
develop the forest land for farming. Forest to farm land conversion could also be a result of
people moving to a former logging area that had become an accessible secondary forest.

Political conditions such as concentration of power and influence of few elites were favored by

4

the government especially in granting logging concessions in the country. Hence, such
interlinked processes results to deforestation. As implied in the second objective of this
research, evaluation and investigation of key deforestation drivers and underlying factors in
three selected municipalities of the country would provide in depth understanding of the

complex mechanisms of deforestation in line with this theoretical framework.

CHAPTER 2
REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
2.1 Deforestation in the Philippines

It is believed that the country was almost covered by lush forests in the pre-colonial era.
By the time Spaniards colonize the country, starting in 1521, it was estimated that 27 million
hectares of forests existed accounting to as much as 90% of the total land area of 30 million
hectares (Pulhin, 2002). Although this rough estimate could vary up to 92% (27.5 m has) since
most references during this period came from the United States’ external sources of calculation
(Bankoff, 2007).

By the end of three centuries of Spanish regime, forest cover was estimated to be at
70% of the total land area or about 21 million hectares (Liu et al., 1993). Due to the
improvement of logging technologies during the American period, this figure dropped to 17
million hectares or 57% of total land area in 1934 (Bautista, 1990) and 15 million (50% of total
land area) hectares by 1950 (Pulhin, 2002). The ‘60s was considered as the start of logging
boom, wherein logging concessions increased from 4.5 million hectares to 11.6 million
hectares (ESSC, 1999) which resulted to 12 million ha of forests remaining (40% of total land
area),

The first known remotely sensed derived forest map utilized Landsat data, based on a
computer algorithm on year 1973 (Lachowski et al., 1979) and showed that 38% of the country
was covered by forests. In 1974, Bruce (1977) showed that the Philippines was covered 29.8%
of forests, followed by 30% in 1976 (Bonita and Revilla, 1977) and 25.9% in 1980 (Forestry
Development Center, 1985). All of them are visually interpreted. However, Kummer (1992b)
warned that these data must be interpreted with enough caution. This was followed by a forest
map from the SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre or Satellite for Observation of

Earth) of the Swedish Space Corporation (1988). It showed that 6.9 million ha or 23.7 % of the

total land area was covered by primary forest. Through the years, there have been in depth
research regarding how much forest cover remained in the country. One of these data was based
on the National Mapping and Resources Information Authority (NAMRIA) generated forest
cover map in 2003 (Chokkalingam et al., 2006). Based on the Landsat ETM+ (Enhanced
Thematic Mapper Plus) images of 2002 and 2003, forest cover was estimated to be at 7.2
million ha or 24% of the total land area (FMB, 2004). This was about 11% higher than the
reported forest cover from the RP-German Forest Resources Inventory Project of the DENR
Forest Management Bureau with 6.46 million ha or 21.5% of the total land area in 1988
(Bautista, 1990). However, the most recent data used by the government based on the
NAMRIA 2010 Land Cover showed that the forested area is about 6,839,718 has or 23% of
the total land area (Sibucao et al., 2014), with a computed annual forest loss rate of -46,954.57
ha/yr.

Philippine deforestation is mainly attributed to extensive logging, shifting cultivation,
and grazing as experienced also by other Southeast Asian (Ohta, 1990). More so, rapid
population growth in agricultural regions (Shively & Martinez, 2001) and expansion of small
scale agriculture contributes to forest loss (Lasco, 2008). According to Suarez and Sajise
(2010), deforestation is a two-way process that begins with logging followed by the shifting
cultivation as people migrated to already open access deforested uplands (see Figure 2). There
are several references regarding country’s forest cover loss in the 20" century like Kummer
(1992a) and Walpole et al., (1993) while Rebugio et al., (2007) tackled the ongoing efforts

regarding forest restoration and rehabilitation in the Philippines. Figures 3 and 4 show the trend

in forest cover of the Philippines in the past.

2.2 Drivers of Deforestation
2.2.1 Types of Deforestation Drivers

According to Geist and Lambin (2002), deforestation drivers can be divided into two
categories: proximate causes and underlying causes. Proximate causes are anthropogenic
activities that directly influence the environment, thus connecting the changes in land cover
and land use (Geist & Lambin, 2001). These include infrastructure extension, agricultural
expansion, wood extraction and biophysical factors such as typhoons and other natural
calamities. On the other hand, indirect or underlying are the fundamental factors that control
the proximate causes of deforestation (Geist & Lambin, 2001). These include demographic,
cultural, economic, policy-institutional, and technological factors. For this study, deforestation
drivers were adapted from the study of Carandang et al. (2013).

Underlying causes of deforestation were described by Contreras-Hermosilla (2000) as

basic structures of society such as distribution of political and economic power, corruption,

(440 SNOITIH MI NOWNGOW WEBI

population growth, weaknesses in the market system, and disparate government policies. Thus
it can be inferred that simplistic cause and effect relationships of forest reduction is arguable
(Contreras and Hermosilla, 2000). Nonetheless, deforestation was mainly attributed to
insatiable human wants of rapidly industrializing urban societies and was fairly documented

throughout the history (Barraclough and Ghimere, 1995).

2.2.2 Global and Regional Drivers

According to United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (1992) as
cited by Barraclough and Ghimere (1995), “Deforestation is a result of many causes: some
natural, but mainly due to human development, like inappropriate land tenure systems and
incentives, expansion of agricultural areas, increasing forest product demand and lack of
information and understanding on the value of forests”. Meanwhile, forests are often reduced
or cleared due to economic reasons and population growth (Ferretti-Gallon and Busch, 2014).
Such economic factors may include soybeans, beef cattle, palm oil, timber, pulp, fuelwood and
small-scale farmers; however, key underlying factors like population and diet that drives
demand for tropical commodities are still included in the process of tropical forest decline
(Boucher et al., 2011).

In Southeast Asia, agricultural expansion and logging are the direct drivers of
deforestation in the region while “public policies, international market demand, and
governance weaknesses are reported as important underlying causes of deforestation" (Wertz

Kanounnikoff & Kongphan-apirak, 2008).

2.2.3 Deforestation Drivers Research in the Philippines
In 2013, Carandang et al. published a detailed study regarding deforestation and forest

degradation drivers in the Philippines from four selected provinces and their municipalities in

10

the Philippines, namely, General Nakar (Quezon), Narra and Quezon (Palawan), various
municipalities in Southern Leyte and Mt. Malindang Natural Park (Misamis Occidental). The
research was geared primarily to aid in the design of REDD+ programs. This was the first
comprehensive research that used key informant interviews (KII), focus group discussions
(FGD), secondary data gathering and field visits. However, the use of remotely sensed data
was non-existent in the said study. By ranking the relative importance of drivers, it was found
out that kaingin was the most important proximate deforestation driver, followed by mining,
and forest conversion to non-forest uses in KI and FGD results. A follow up study was done
by Bugayong et al. (2016), focusing on the key deforestation and forest degradation drivers in
REDD+ site in Davao Oriental and Easter Samar which incorporated the land cover change

of NAMRIA 2003 and NAMRIA 2010 land cover maps.

2.3 Landsat
23.1 History

The Landsat Program was conceptualized in the late 1960’s in the midst of space
exploration such as the Apollo missions (Lauer et al., 1997) and dubbed as “the result of Apollo
Program” since earth photographs taken by pre-Apollo missions such as Gemini stirred its
development (Lowman, 1999). It was the idea by the late director of United States Geological
(USGS) Survey William T. Pecora to propose the first civilian operated satellite that will
continuously monitor the earth through captured images. It was first launched in July 23, 1972
and originally named as Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) later renamed as
Landsat 1 (USGS & NASA, 2003). Since then, it provided images of earth that was applied to
diverse fields of earth science research.

The program itself encountered many changes especially in the administration aspect

(Figure 5). Initially, it was developed and launched by National Aeronautics and Space

‘Administration (NASA) as an experimental satellite and USGS became in charge of the
archiving and data distribution. In 1984, through the “Land Remote Sensing
Commercialization Act” NASA and USGS transferred the full operation to Landsat
Commercialization Division of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
and in October 1985, the contract to operate Landsat 4 and 5 was awarded to EOSAT (Earth
Observation Satellite Company) by NOAA (USGS & NASA, 2003). The 1980s era proved that
high data costs, limited global coverage, data distribution problems and failure to reach orbit
of Landsat 6 in 1993 were among the results of Landsat commercialization (Williams et al.,
2006). In 1992, Land Remote Sensing Act was passed to bring back the Landsat management
to US government. The Landsat 7 Program underwent through the agencies of NASA/USAF
(United States Air Force)/USGS to NASA/NOAA/USGS to a bi-agency NASA/USGS
partnership (NASA, undated). The most recent satellite, Landsat 8 was launched in February

11, 2013. In addition, Landsat made its whole archive free starting January 2009.

2.3.2 Mission and Sensor Characteristics
Seven Landsat satellites became operational. They took image of the earth in sun-

synchronous orbit that allows the satellite to preserve uniform angle between the sun and earth

(USGS & NASA, 2003). The altitude for the Landsat 1, 2, and 3 platform is at 920 km (572
miles) circling the earth every 103 minutes with a repeat coverage of 18 days, compared to
Landsats 4, 5, 7 and 8 with an altitude of 705 km (438 miles), making a complete orbit every
99 minutes, attaining 14 full orbits a day and scans the same spot on the earth every 16 days
(USGS, 2012). Landsat 7 and 8 complement each other because the former satellite was

followed by the latter satellite after eight days, on the same location.

Sensors that were attached to Landsat satellites were Return Beam Vidicon (RBV),
Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
(ETM#), Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS.) Each sensor
were much more improved than their predecessors. The sensors were attached to specific

Landsat satellites (Table 1).

(Modified from USGS Fact Sheet 2012-3072)

‘Among the sensors of Landsat 1-3, it was proved that MSS was far more superior to
RBV. The latter was based on Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) weather
satellite system (responsible to deliver television-like images), but it eventually shutdown due
to electrical problems (Cohen & Goward, 2004). Since then, approaches to use the satellite
detived data became numerical (Williams et al., 2006). MSS has a spatial resolution of 80

meters in four spectral bands (from visible green to near-infrared). The said kind of sensor was

present for the first three satellites (Landsat 1-3), however Landsat 3 has an additional fifth

band in the thermal-infrared wavelength (USGS & NASA, 2003).

Landsat 4 and 5 have the same MSS of Landsat 3, and the new TM sensor. The TM
sensor carried the seven additional bands, which has a better resolution of 30 meters for the
visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands. It has also a 60 m resolution thermal
infrared-thermal band (USGS, 2012). On the other hand, Landsat 7 carried the ETM+ which
improved the resolution of band 6 to 60 meters and added the band 8 (1-meter panchromatic
band) to sharpen images. Moreover, with Landsat 8, OLI delivers 30-meter resolution in 8
spectral bands and a single panchromatic band (15 meters). Table 2 summarizes band

designations for all Landsat sensors.

2.3.3 Landsat 7 and Scan Line Corrector Failure

The Scan Line Corrector (SLC) malfunctioned in May 2003 that caused data gaps on
the produced image, since it compensates for the forward motion of the satellite to align
forward and reverse scans necessary to create an image (USGS, 2012). Attempts to repair this
SLC failure have not been successful as the predicament appeared to be permanent (NASA,
undated). Nevertheless, the satellite continued to transmit useful data (about 75% of the whole

image) and solutions such filling the SLC-off images with SLC-on data.

2.3.4 Applications of Landsat and Role to Natural Resource Studies

The Landsat Program holds the extensive and continuous source of earth images
capture from space and it was designed to continually acquire global data from a moderate
resolution since 1972 (NASA & USGS, 2012). The oldest earth observing program have been
used by the government, military, industry, academe and civilian throughout the government.

Thus, many applications such as global research change, forestry, agriculture, geology,

14

resource management, geography mapping, water quality and to some extent oceanography
(USGS & NASA, 2003). The joint publication of USGS & NASA (2013) “Landsat: Continuing
to Improve Everyday Life” is a great resource for learning the many application of Landsat,

with case study for each application.

Figure 6. SLC-on scene (a). Scene after the SLC-off problem (b). SLC-off scene interpolated
to fill gaps (c).

Landsat’s impact to conservation biology were evaluated by Leimgruber et al. (2005)
through bibliographic research in high impact journals. They found out that field is not an early
user of the product due to technical and capacity constraints (hardware and software costs,
training and data handling), high costs due to commercialization and their field has not
developed until the 1980s. Nonetheless, the program’s success were attributed to the following
(Leimgruber et al. 2005):

a) 30-m spatial resolution that permits adequate detail that spot land use changes

b) long data continuity, giving records of how the Earth’s land has transformed over two to
three decades, and

©) current Landsat data acquisition strategies permitting cloud-free scenes and seasonal

assessments while providing global scope.

Ina broader context, Cohen and Goward comprehensively studied in 2004 the influence
of Landsat to ecology from initial applications, such as the formulation of vegetation indices
and the addition of SWIR bands. The authors also cited the program as the “ambassador to
remote sensing applications to ecology”. They said that the Landsat's advantages are the
following:

a, Has the longest-running time series of methodically collected remote sensing
information.

b. The spatial resolution enables land cover and land cover change detection.

c. Acquires spectral measurements in all major bands of electromagnetic spectrum.

4. Affordable (at the time of the said paper’s publication).

2.4 Application of Landsat to Forest Monitoring

Remote sensing in combination with the ground measurements has a vital role in
measuring forest cover (Achard et al., 2007). Since deforestation and forest degradation
account for the 17% of all anthropogenic greenhouse emissions (IPCC, 2007) (second to the
fossil fuel combustion), there’s a great need to monitor forest cover changes from global to
regional and multi-temporal scales. Nonetheless, deforestation is the most significant among
drivers of land cover change due to the extent of transformation in biophysical and ecological

properties (Townshend et al., 2012). This portion tackles the use of Landsat for forest cover

change monitoring.

2.4.1 Global Land Cover Products
There have been several projects that used Landsat to produce global land datasets that
may be applicable for forest cover studies. Among these are the Global Land Survey (GLS) by

Gutman et al. (2008), Geocover by Tucker et al. (2004) and Tropical Ecosystem Environment

16

Observations by Satellites Il (TREES II) (Mayaux et al., 2005). GLS is different from TREES
Il since the former focused on the selection of cloud free images of Landsat in different epochs
(1975, 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010). On the other hand, TREES II is the second phase of TREES
project that mainly used visual interpretation of Landsat scenes for the whole globe. Geocover
is just the preceding project of GLS. In the paper of Mayaux et al. (2005) efforts regarding the
use of Landsat to study forest cover change were extensively studied, and it contributed in
terms of wall to wall and sampling based mapping of forests.

The project of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO-UN)
through Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) (conducted every five years), was a
consistent program that also used Landsat scenes. In 2001, FAO FRA 2000 published a
conducted limited sampling of Landsat based images in order to come up with an estimate of
global forest from 1990 to 2000. In the recent global FRA, Landsat is used since it provided
global scope, long-series of imagery, and spectral traits suitable to detect changes in forest
cover (FAO & JRC, 2012). Hence, there was an emphasis to use Landsat for the said project.
Furthermore, Global Forest Cover Change, a website that integrates forest cover related
products derived from satellites recognized the Landsat GLS products together with Moderate
Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) (Channan et al.,
2012; World Resource Institute, 2015) and other published data such as Intact Forest
Landscapes (IFL) (Potapov et al., 2008). It is a joint project of NASA and University of
Maryland (UMD). Moreover, efforts have been done to study global forest loss, and gain, net
changes or forest cover change in general using Landsat data (Hansen et. al 2013; GLCF &

GSFC, 2014, Kim et al., 2014).

2.4.2 Landsat as Training, Validation or Reference Data

Landsat was frequently used as a training data and validation imagery to other remote
sensing products. This was exemplified in the studies of integrating it to MODIS (Hansen et
al., 2008; Hansen et al., 2003; Hayes et al., 2007; Portillo-Quintero & Sanchez-Azofeifa, 2010).
The coarser Advanced Very High Resolution Spectroradiometer (AVHRR) also used Landsat
as a training site (DeFries et al., 1998), or as a reference data (Cross et al., 1991). In addition,
‘Asner et al, (2009) developed a software that solely used Landsat at its main input. Its name is
Carnegie Landsat Analysis System (CLASite), user friendly desktop software which uses

several remote sensing data to monitor deforestation and forest degradation on a regional level.

2.4.3 Forest Cover Loss Studies in Southeast Asia

Margono et al. (2012) mapped the forest disturbance of primary forests within
Indonesia using Landsat data from the year 1990 to 2010 and found out that the rate of forest
cover loss and degradation have slowed down from 7.34 (1990 to 2000) to 2.51 million hectares
(2000 to 2010). Meanwhile, Landsat is integrated with MODIS and AVHRR via selected
approach to monitor tropical deforestation from the same country and also found out that there
was a significant decrease of forest clearing from 1990s (1.78 Mha/year) to 2000 (0.71
Mha/year) (Hansen et al., 2009). A follow up study was done by Margono et al. (2014) that
mapped the primary forest extent and loss of Indonesia from year 2000-2012 using Landsat
forest cover change maps (Hansen et al., 2013). Results showed that 6.02 Mha were lost from
2000-2012, with an average loss of 47,600 ha/year.

On the other hand, (Giree et al., 2013) conducted sample-based monitoring method to
quantify forest cover loss from Landsat imagery and it was employed to approximate gross
forest cover loss for two eras, 1990-2000 and 2000-2005 in Malaysia. On each time interval,

a probability sample of 18.5 km 18.5 km blocks was designated, and pairs of Landsat images

21

used per sample block were inferred to quantify forest cover area and gross forest cover loss.
They found out that annual gross forest cover loss was 0.43 Mha/year (1990-2000) and 0.64

Mha/year (2000-2005).

2.4.4 Hansen Forest Loss and Gain Map

In 2013, Hansen et al. (2013) published the “High-Resolution Global Maps of 2st-
Century Forest Cover Change” in Science Journal. It is the first research that enable the world
to see forest cover dynamics through loss and gain from starting year of 2000 to 2012. The
thing that separates this study from others is that they collaborated with Google and USGS to
carry out their endeavor. Google was in charge of massive parallel computing and USGS
assisted in data mining of Landsat 7 scenes in their archive.

With the use automated processing and decision tree algorithm, they come up with the
first highly detailed forest cover change maps all over the globe. They also, provided an online
repository to retrieve their processed data for further research and validation. Conversely, there
was a published comment on the same journal where it says that results of Hansen et al., (2013)
does an underestimated forest cover quantities since the product included herbaceous and
plantations (Tropek et al., 2014). On the side of Hansen et al. (2014), they argued that their
results rely on the premise of their forest definitions and statistically sampled estimates must
be done to validate Tropek et al. (2014) comments.

The said Landsat derived data have been used to several studies in national and global
scales. Mentioned earlier was the study of Margono et al. (2014), regarding primary forest
cover loss in Indonesia. Moreover, global study on protected area and IFL that incorporated

Hansen Landsat processed data were carried out by Heino et al. in 2015.

22

2.45 Hansen Forest Cover Change Methodology

Automated pre-processing steps were first carried out for the Hansen et al., (2013)
forest cover change methodology. These include (i) image resampling, (ii) conversion of raw
digital values (DN) to top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, (iii) cloud/shadow/water screening
and quality assessment (QA), and (iv) image normalization. After the Landsat pre-processing
steps, time series metrics were derived. These are the (i) reflectance values, which indicates
minimum, maximum and selected percentiles (ji) mean reflectance values for observations for
observations between selected percentiles and (iii) linear regression slope of band reflectance
value versus imagery date. Training data were then used to relate the said metrics and are

derived from the followin;

image interpretation from higher spatial resolution such as
Quickbird imagery, percent tree cover layers from Landsat and global MODIS percent tree
cover (Hansen et al., 2013).

The main algorithm used for the said study is the decision tree classifier. A hierarchical
classification designates a set of data into homogenous groups, which is called the nodes. Then
percent tree cover, forest loss and gain training dataset were used to relate it to decision tree
classifiers. After this, percent tree cover and forest cover change products were generated using

a bagged decision tree process (Hansen et al., 2013).

CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY

3.1 Methodological Framework and Flowchart

In Figure 7, the methodological framework was shown to serve as the general guide in
the conduct of this study. The methodological framework starts with the analysis of remote
sensing data derived from the Landsat processed outputs of Hansen et al. (2013). Trends and
patterns of forest loss will be correlated to forestry statistics from the government. In addition,
events or conditions that might have been influenced those forest loss trends are examined
through review of published reports or grey literature. These three inputs will result to updated
information regarding forest loss, rates and its factors. After this, this information would be
integrated in socio-economic surveys done in three visited municipalities of the country. In

such step of integration, existing mechanisms of Philippine deforestation will be visited and

compared with the results of this research, Present mechanisms of Philippine deforestation is
centered in the activities of logging firms and migrant upland settlers. The former opens up a

forest due to high timber demand and policies by the government that promotes logging while

24

the latter practice permanent cropland establishment in open access forests because of
landlessness, inadequate economic opportunities and population growth. Such activities of the
said agents refer to direct drivers while the reasons they do such activities refer to indirect
drivers. The common process of deforestation tells us that logging activities inside inaccessible
forests would be followed by migration of people in the forest lands as the logging contracts
expires. In this framework, such present mechanism of deforestation in the country will be
analyzed in relation to research results from the left side portion of the framework. Eventually,
any new insights about Philippine deforestation would be used as a basis in the formulation of
sound policies and effective forest governance interventions.

Figure 8 shows the methodological flowchart carried out in this study, showing specific
details. The research was consisted of two parts, namely, remote sensing data processing and

validation and accuracy assessment. In this figure, inputs were represented by parallelograms,

outputs by rectangle and processing steps by rounded rectangles. The details of each will be

discussed thoroughly in the next sections.

3.1.1 Pre-processing

First, the Hansen Landsat processed dataset were downloaded and pre-processing steps
were done before subjecting them to main data analysis. These processing steps include
extraction, subsetting, and percent treecover thresholding of the Landsat processed data.
Extraction eliminates non-forest pixel (e.g. dense coconut stands and other perennial crops
misclassified as forests) classified as forests using the intersection of five forest vectors (see
Figure 9) while subsetting was done based on regional and provincial boundaries Aside from
masking the Landsat processed data using the intersection of all five vectors, individual
extraction for each forest vectors were done as well for comparison purposes. Lastly, an
arbitrary percent treecover thresholding was done to make sure that year 2000 forests have a
dense canopy cover which is 85% and above. The minimum area of forest used in this study is

equal to one Landsat pixel (about 900 m?).

3.1.2 Main Data Processing
The main data processing portion was divided into three parts: gain, loss & aggregate
net change rank processing, annual forest loss and rate processing and annual forest cover

processing. The first part produced both regional and provincial ranking and statistics, which

of loss, gain and aggregate net change. Aggregate net change was computed in order to
compare forest changes across all regions/provinces regardless of their year 2000 forest cover
area (see Equation 1). Next, the annual forest loss processing had outputs of provincial and
regional annual forest loss comprise the annual loss graphs and annual forest rates. Forest loss
rates were determined by dividing the total loss by twelve years (see Equation 2). Lastly, the
annual forest cover processing resulted both into provincial and regional annual forest cover
statistics, which is used to create annual forest cover animations. These results were used
subsequently in the validation and accuracy assessment portion of this study. Moreover, forest
cover type processing (based on selected forest vectors) was done in order to analyze further
the various dynamics that were occurring in various forests types both in regional and

provincial level.

3.1.3 Validation and Accuracy Assessment

There were three parts for the validation and accuracy assessment, the field based,
secondary data based and satellite data based. The field based was done in order to identify the
direct and indirect factors that facilitate deforestation on a particular municipality. The
selection of the municipality to be visited was based upon the results of remote sensing data
Processing particularly the aggregate net change ranking. Then, key informant interviews,
focus groups discussions in conjunction with the KIIs were carried out. The outputs of KIIs
and FGDs were basically the ranking of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation

28

based on the tally of interviewees’ answers (for KII) and consensus in FGDs. Next secondary
data were gathered and collected from the Forest Management Bureau, designated as various
forestry statistics. These were correlated with the annual forest loss and cover statistics in
provincial and regional level. Finally, satellite based accuracy assessment was performed using
a map data (derived from the Landsat processed data) and reference data (high resolution and
other geospatial images). The expected outputs for this accuracy assessment are confusion
matrices or contingency tables for both change and no change features. Details about these
validation and accuracy assessment techniques would be expounded and explained further in

section 3.3

3.2 Data Access and Charateri

ies
3.2.1 Landsat Processed Data Characteristics

The main data were downloaded from http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-
2013-global-forest/download_v1.2.html hosted by the University of Maryland, Department of
Geographical Sciences (see Figure 10). They are in TIF (Tag Image File) format with eight-bit
unsigned integer value per pixel, georeferenced in WGS-84 datum (see Table 3 for details).
The resolution is approximately 30 meters at the equator and the five tiles were chosen for the
Philippines namely, 20N 110E (Palawan), 20N 120E (Luzon), 10N 110E (Sulu and Tawi
Tawi), 10N 120E (Mindanao) and 30N 120E (Batanes). All tiles have a 10 by 10 degree
dimension. The data are in 1.2 version and only loss years from years 2001-2012 were used

since, 2013 and 2014 needs further validation (since it used Landsat 8, instead of Landsat 7).

3.2.2 Forest Vectors Used in the Study
Five forest vectors were used to isolate forest areas of the country. This was done to

eliminate features from the main data that appeared as forest vegetation but not in the ground.

29

‘These features could be coconuts, rubber plantation or other wooded vegetation that appear as
forests in the satellite data but not in reality. These forest vectors came from various institutions
with different publication dates and mapping years. Table 4 shows the details of such forest
maps. These five forest vectors thus improved the confidence that only forests were extracted
in doing the analysis. Though these vectors vary in terms of their acquisition dates and satellite
data source, it was assumed that its effects were negligible. Hence, it can still be used to

establish the main data’s year 2000 baseline of forest areas.

The provincial and regional vectors used to subset the tiles were derived from country
base maps vector files of http://philgis.org/freegisdata.htm. On the other hand, five forest
vectors from Table 4 were used to facilitate proper masking of non-forest areas before doing

the main data processing. As explained in 3.1.1, this was done by intersecting first all five forest

vectors before it was used to extract the Landsat processed data. This was carried out to make
sure that all Landsat processed data pixels had a high confidence of being classified as being
forest in the baseline year of 2000. As explained, each of the individual forest vectors were
used as separate forest masks to allow comparison in the said five forest vectors. Nonetheless,
thresholding of treecover2000 tile in Table 3 assures that forests that were mature enough and

had dense canopy were in analyzed in the main data processing portion.

3.3. Details of Validation and Accuracy Assessment Techniques
3.3.1 Satellite Based

High-resolution images were used as reference data such as Google Earth, ArcMap
basemap and Landsat NDVI and bands four and three ratio images of year 2000 and 2012. This
Process used two-stage probability based stratified random sampling. First, whole country was

divided into four distinct and modified biogeographic regions, namely, Greater Luzon, Greater

32

Palawan-Mindoro, Greater Negros Panay and Greater Mindanao (see Appendix K). It used the
assumption that these regions were based upon the distribution patterns of vascular plants,
(FPE, 2014) particularly the trees that comprise forests. Small but distinct biogeographic zone
such as Sibuyan and Burias islands were clumped to their nearest and major biogeographic
region (in this case, Negros-Panay). Classifying the country according to these biogeographic
zones served as the first stratum while the second stratum is the allocation of main data pixels
into no change, loss, and gain. In this case, the ratio of no change, loss and gain follows the
5:3:2 ratio, based on the validation exercise of Hansen et al. (2013). On each biogeographic
region, 80 features were allocated for no change, 48 for loss and 32 for gain, with a total of 160
features. Overall, 640 features were analyzed. Each feature were scored according to quartiles
of referenced change, meaning, the proportion of gain and loss was interpreted as 0, 0.25, 0.50,
0.75 and 1 based from the reference images. After the scoring part, confusion matrix was
generated to determine the level of accuracy of forest change pixel on each biogeographic zone.
Each biogeographic zone has two confusion matrices, one for gain and one for loss. Lastly, the
‘accuracy assessment was summarized by an overall accuracy, representing all four
biogeographic regions.

3.3.2 Field Based Validation

Particular provinces were selected based on the aggregate net change ranking process
from the main data processing. As mentioned in 3.1.3, three methods were adopted for the
field-based validation, namely, key informant interview (KII), focus group discussion (FGD)
and actual site visits. The questionnaire were formulated using the guide from ASEAN
Regional Knowledge Network on Forest and Climate Change (ARKN-FCC) (2014), which
was primarily used as a decision support tool to identify and address drivers of deforestation

and forest degradation. The said document was mainly used to guide project implementers in

33

REDD¢+ projects. The first part of KI asked interviewees regarding basic information on the
source of livelihoods (of communities dependent on or living near the forest), forestry and other
development programs implemented and tenure instruments present on their area. In the second
part of KI, an annual forest loss graph, together with the annual forest cover animation was
shown to the interviewee and asked what proximate deforestation drivers might contributed on
each specific year. Then, the interviewee was asked to score the direct and indirect drivers of
deforestation based from a set of prioritization criteria from Bugayong et al. (2016) and
underline specific deemed causes from a list, or add another proximate cause, if it was not on
the list. Finally, suggestions regarding sustainable and sound management of forests were
asked from the subject. (See Appendix V). The results of the interviews per site were
summarized, tallied and presented on a table. On the other hand, data related to forest cover
changes were acquired from Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO)
and Municipal Environment and Natural Resources Office (MENRO). Useful ancillary data
such as maps, barangay boundaries, pictures and tenure instrument shapefiles were requested
to leam more about deforestation processed on the areas visited.

Next, focus group discussions were carried out in a common venue (e.g. CENRO or
municipal hall). Most of the people who participated in the said discussions were stakeholders
coming from the MENRO and CENRO employees. Most of the upland farmers’ participation
was limited to KII, since they cannot attend the group discussions. Like in KII, questions and
activities in FGD involved the ranking of deforestation drivers and identifying specific causes
of forest reduction in annual forest loss graphs presented.

Lastly, site visits were carried out to see areas where forest losses occurred. It included
kaingin sites, timber-poaching sites, newly deforested sites and other areas pre-identified using

the Landsat derived data. The waypoints and tracks of the visited sites were recorded using a

34

GPS device. Then, they were uploaded in Google Earth together with the Landsat processed

data for verification.

3.3.3 Secondary Data Based

Annual forestry statistics were downloaded from the Forest Management Bureau’s
website from year 2000-2012 (DENR-FMB, various years). Then, these were collated at the
provincial and regional level. Using R programming language, the said various forestry
statistics were correlated to annual forest loss and annual forest cover using the spearman-rank
order correlation method. This non-parametric type of correlation method was used because it
satisfied the assumption that the forestry statistics and remotely sensed forest data had
distributions that were not normal, no linear relationship between the two. Provinces and

regions with significant correlations were presented and summarized using tables.

CHAPTER 4
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

4.1 Deforestation Data
4.1.1 Nationwide Results

Whole country annual forest loss was shown in Figure 11. It shows that there was an
increasing trend of forest loss from year 2000-2012. Its forest loss rate of 4,468.60 hectares per
year is a conservative estimate of the actual forest loss trend in the country since an intersection
of all five forest vectors was used to isolate forest areas. Also, an eighty five percent and up
treecover threshold used in this study might underrepresent treecover pixels that still qualify as
forest in the ground. The implementation of Executive Order Number 23, the logging

moratorium in the natural and residual forests (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette,

2011) has an impact in lowering the forest loss in year 201 1 but it slightly increased in the year

to Annual Roundwood and Lumber Production (significant at p-value < 0.05)

Figures 12 and 13 showed that the annual roundwood production (wood in its natural
state as felled or harvested) and annual lumber production (the product of saw and planning
mill) were both moderately associated with Landsat processed data’s annual forest loss. The
steady increase in forest loss from year 2001 to 2007 can be explained by the increasing trend
of lumber and log production, as well as the number and volume of trees cut and harvested in
the country. Policies implemented by DENR (DAO No. 24, s.1996; DAO No. 04s.1997; DAO
No. 53 s.1999) have been the new concession agreement that replaced the Timber License
Agreement (TLA) of the past. It can be assumed that these policies strongly influenced the
increase in forest loss as related to the said forestry statistics of the country. However, the
decline in forest loss in 2008 was unexplained by the said factors, perhaps the global financial
crisis on that year could be one of the reasons that drive the reduction in forest loss. According

37

to Yap et al. (2009), sectors such as forestry, agriculture and construction declined in its growth
rate. This could possibly dropped down the demand for wood and construction materials
lowering the forest loss in year 2008. Nevertheless, thorough studies should be done to validate

the impacts of the 2008 financial crisis to forestry sector.

Figure 14. Key Indicators on Growth Rates (in Percent) (Adapted from Yap et. al., 2009).

Forest cover values from years 2000 and 2012 were presented in the Table 5, as well as
their forest loss rates. It is essential to express the forest cover in percentage relative to total
area of land as this is the common practice in presenting the country’s remaining forest area.
Also, the threshold criteria of eighty five and up tree cover percentage affected the numbers in
Table 5. Obviously, the MODIS vectors had the highest loss rate and deducted forest cover
from 2000-2012. MODIS vector (32.48% in year 2000) tend to overclassify tree vegetation
which do not really represent contiguous and intact forest cover as mapped by other vectors.
On one hand, TREES (21.24%) had the least remaining forest cover in 2012, (followed by
ESSC at 21.90%). This can probably cause by the coarse resolution of TREES, while strict

38

exclusion of forest plantation in ESSC resulted to such low forest cover. Forest cover

percentage with respect to land are not far from each other for NAMRIA, TREES and ESSC,

implying some degree of map agreement among themselves. This was also true for their forest

loss rates, both expressed in hectares per year and percentage. The table summarized the initial

and final forest cover and it implies that, more or less, the forest loss rates of NAMRIA, TREES.

and ESSC might represent the actual loss rate in the ground, The actual values of forest loss is

highly dependent on the vector used and probably, in the treecover threshold applied in this

study. Nevertheless, consistency in the values was illustrated above by using the said forest

vectors and Landsat processed data.

As for the change maps per forest vector (see Figures 15-19), it can be seen that most
losses occurred near the fringes of an intact forest like in Palawan and Sierra Madre. In addition,
some of the single pixel losses might probably represent the artifacts or errors of the Landsat
processed data. But sometimes, there were huge losses inside an intact forests like in
Zamboanga del Norte since this province is mostly occupied by tenure concessions such as
Integrated Forest Management Agreement (IFMA) where timber harvesting/logging occurred.
Meanwhile, the already fragmented forests in Zamboanga Sibugay were also experiencing
losses that can be perhaps caused by farming of migrant settlers in the uplands, as they are
Pushed more to inhabit the forest frontiers, brought about by landlessness and limited
livelihood opportunities in the lowlands. Nonetheless, the results by region and province in the

next section identified specific places where significant losses occurred.

The derived Landsat processed data from data analysis were compared to the NAMRIA

2003 and 2010 Land Cover Maps (FMB, 2004; NAMRIA, 2013) and 2010 Global Forest

Resources Assessment (FRA) (FAO, 2010a; FAO, 2010b) of the United Nations in order to

lend confidence to this research’s results (see Table 6). The Global FRA data of 2010 came

from the various reports of country experts, and the UN FAO compiled those data every five

years while the NAMRIA land cover maps was generated by the land cover mapping division

of the said agency and has more indefinite schedule of release. Nonetheless, NAMRIA 2003

data was used in the FRA reporting process of the country. Since their official mapping years

were varied, the Landsat processed data’s starting and ending years, namely, 2003 and 2010,

were adjusted for ease of comparison. Based on the FRA, it showed that there was an increase

from 23.72% to 25.75% from year 2000 to 2010 (change rate: 54,800 ha/yr). However, this

was contradicted by NAMRIA, registering a decrease of 1.09% (change rate: -46,954.57 ha/yr).
This difference was due to the fact that NAMRIA 2010 land cover was not fully released until
year 2013, and probably, FRA data came from NAMRIA 2003's data interpolation. When it
comes to Landsat processed data, it illustrated lower forest loss rates compared to FRA and
‘NAMRIA. The large variation in loss of NAMRIA could be explained by the different imagery
sources and acquisition dates in the satellite imageries it used. Landsat processed data’s lower
forest loss rates illuminates its consistency and spatial explicitness. Nevertheless, TREES,
ESSC and NAMRIA forest loss rates values were close to each other in both 2000-2010 and
2003-2010 period. From 2003-2010, it was obvious that there was a sudden increase in
BSWM'’s forest loss (-42,283.76 ha) in comparison with 2003-2010 period (-15,416.08 ha). It
can be inferred that BSWM might added more forests in its mapping process upon conducting
visual inspection of the author in the said forest vector. The next section will draw more insights

by presenting the deforestation data in the regional level.

4.1.2 Results by Region

In Figure 20, top regions in terms of gross forest loss and gain are shown. Cagayan
Valley and MIMAROPA regions topped the other regions. However, the top three in loss,
Cordillera Administrative Region was replaced by CARAGA region in the gain ranking. It is
important to note that Cagayan Valley is notable for Sierra Madre Mountains while
MIMAROPA includes the province of Palawan, the country’s last frontier. Intuitively, such
regions with vast areas of forest have the capability to loss or gain large forest areas.

Table 7 showed the ranking of regions based on their net changes. All of the regions
exhibited negative net changes, thus, forest losses are always greater than gains. On this table,

Cagayan Valley showed the highest net change (-11,602.53 ha), followed by MIMAROPA

(-6,426.72 ha) and Cordillera Administrative Region (-5,458.95 ha). National Capital Region

did not register any change and forest cover for year 2000. The intersection of five forest

vectors used to isolate forest areas excluded some forests in La Mesa Forest Reserve of NCR.
Cagayan Valley (1,040.04 ha/yr) had twice as much forest loss rate compared to MIMAROPA
(608.6! ha/yr) and CAR (408.69ha/yr). This strengthens the assumption that regions with large
forest areas tend to lose more of their forest cover. Aside from this, the inclusion of forest loss
rates on this table gives us the baseline data that can be used to craft sound management in
halting such deforestation rates. On one hand, Zamboanga Peninsula was the only region to be
included in the top ten despite its relatively low forest cover for year 2000. Again, the said data
in Table 7 does not represent the actual area of forests in the ground since the derivation of

forest areas are highly dependent on forest vectors and tree cover threshold.

Annual forest loss for the top three regions in terms of net change is shown in Figure
21 with corresponding forest loss rates. Peak loss years varied on each region. For example,
Cagayan Valley had the highest forest loss in year 2003; 2007 and 2010 for MIMAROPA and
2009 for Cordillera Administrative Region. Cagayan Valley’s Isabela province could be the
major source of forest loss while Apayao might be the province where forest loss is
concentrated. This is supported by the logging (concession) zones in the natural forests of the
Philippines (see Figure 22). For CARAGA, it could be exemplified by Agusan del Sur, Agusan
del Norte and Surigao del Sur whereas Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga de! Sur might
represent Zamboanga region in terms of logging areas, based from Figure 22. The only
province which was not included was Palawan because commercial logging was not allowed
since 1992 as mandated by Strategic Environmental Plan Law (RA 7611). Therefore, we
assume that most forest losses occurred in MIMAROPA’s Palawan province by illegal means
and considering that most of MIMAROPA’s forests are located in Palawan, Overall, Cagayan
Valley had the largest forest loss rates among the three regions. Meanwhile the effects of
logging moratorium was seen in CAR and MIMROPA region, signifying a sudden decline in

Year 20111, Peak loss years of Cagayan Valley and MIMAROPA will be explained later in 4.1.3.

Table 8 shows the ranking of regions based on their mean aggregate net changes derived
from various forest vectors used in this study. Since aggregate net change represents the
proportion of change relative to year 2000 baseline forest cover, we are now able to compare
the regions’ forest cover changes regardless of their starting area of forest in year 2000.
Evidently, Zamboanga Peninsula region topped all the other regions on each of the forest vector
(except for ESSC). The reason for this is that ESSC’s forest cover map did not consider the La
Mesa Forest Reserve as a forest, since it was artificially established through reforestation.
Therefore, any forests remaining in NCR (as mapped by ESSC), probably mangroves,
experienced a huge aggregate net change of almost 30 percent. This was also supported by
NCR’s high standard deviation and coefficient of variation. Thus, if we eliminate NCR in the
top three; it will be replaced by CALABARZON followed by CARAGA.

Figure 23. Graphical presentation of top three regions in terms of aggregate

net change (error bars are standard errors).

Nonetheless, aggregate net changes of Zamboanga Peninsula is almost twice as much
as other regions” aggregate net changes. It ranges from 6.79% to 7.28% as shown in Figure 23.
Perhaps, forests in Zamboanga Peninsula were already fragmented so it facilitates a faster
forest reduction. In addition, systematic timber harvesting possibly exists in the region that is
why Landsat derived data indicated such results. On the other hand, regions like
CALABARZON, CARAGA and MIMAROPA with large and contiguous forests ranked
second, third and fourth (if we exclude NCR) in terms of mean aggregate net change,
Tespectively. If we analyze each of the forest vectors (Figure 23), it seems that the MODIS
forest vector consistently appeared with the highest value on such graphs. It can be inferred
that MODIS forest vector had isolated relatively large portion of pixels as forest. These pixels
Perceived as forests could plausibly include coconuts, brush lands and other trees found in
urban areas and upland farms.

Figure 25 showed the annual forest losses of Zamboanga Peninsula, CALABARZON
and CARAGA region. Among the three regions, CARAGA was the only region that exhibited
a positively moderate and increasing pattern of forest loss (r = 0.69), with forest loss rate of
392.48 ha. Compared to Figure 21, it was evident that the top three regions by aggregate net
change have lower forest loss rates. It is possible that regions with lower and starting forest
cover are more prone in losing their forests in a much faster rate compared to other regions
where forests are still contiguous and intact. Again, regions like Zamboanga Peninsula have
fragmented forests and are more accessible than that of, for example, Cagayan Valley’s intact
and contiguous Sierra Madre Mountain Range (see Figure 24). In connection with the log ban,
all the regions in Figure 25 responded positively in the said ban, but they eventually registered

higher forest loss in the following year (2012). This pattern implies that such policies were just

good at the beginning of implementation and difficult to sustain in a nationwide scale. Here,
logging bans effectiveness is questioned. Also, it was evident that another logging suspension
imposed in December 2004 (DENR, 2004) had lowered year 2005 forest loss in Zamboanga
Peninsula Region and CARAGA, but this was not the case for CALABARZON. Later in March
2005, the logging suspension was lifted in CARAGA and Davao Region (Carandang, 2013)
but not in Zamboanga region (Rivera, 2005). The increase in 2005 and 2006 forest loss in
CALABARZON might be a result of massive landslides at Quezon province (since more than
80% of CALABARZON's forests were in Quezon) in December 2004 (later detected in 2005)
and issuance of cutting permits to allow the salvage of washed out logs, but it is also probable
that these permits were used to fell some standing timber. For CARAGA, it appeared to respond
positively in the logging bans of year 2004 (as seen in 2005), and 2011, but there was a

noticeable increase in year 2012, a clear violation of E.O. 23.

In the table above, forest loss rates per vector were summarized and it showed that
MIMAROPA had the biggest mean forest loss rate. It was evident that regions listed above
‘were the same regions that exhibited the highest net changes, and two out of five (Zamboanga

Peninsula and CARAGA) were in the top three aggregate net change ranking table (Table 8).

4.1.3 Results by Province

Provincial analysis was done to detect changes locally. The graph in Figure 26 shows
that the top three provinces by loss are Palawan, Isabela and Apayao; while Palawan, Cagayan
and Agusan del Sur for gain. It is apparent that these are member provinces of regions indicated
in Figure 20. The abovementioned provinces dominantly contribute to forest dynamics on their
respective regions. Like in Figure 20, the MODIS forest vector still had the highest values in

terms of loss and gain. Again, this is attributed to the fact that some MODIS forest pixels do

not represent forests on the ground. Probably, these are just tree vegetation outside the

contiguous and intact forests.

Table 10 indicates top provinces by net change, along with forest loss rates. The loss
tates and net changes were proportional to the year 2000 forest cover. This supports the
hypothesis that places with large forest cover has a higher tendency to lose more, compared to
less forested places. As expected, top three provinces shown on this table belong to top three

Tegions listed in Table 7. Aside from that, all of the net changes remained negative. This could
54

mean that forest regeneration or growth are always surpassed by forest reduction. There is a
high probability that this really happens on the ground since reforestation or spontaneous forest
regeneration takes time to be detected by satellite data, compared to deforestation. The decline

in forest cover could happen abruptly and it can easily be spotted by satellite data. Nonetheless,

if Palawan’s forest cover in 2000 is divided by the whole region’s starting forest cover, the
result will amount to more than 80%. Meaning, Palawan accounts for the largest portion of
forests in MIMAROPA. This situation is different for Isabela which only accounts for almost
40% of starting forest cover of Cagayan Valley. Nevertheless, forest protection activities on
the said provinces needs to be revisited to halt such forest loss. Moreover, Zamboanga
Peninsula’s forests are coming from Zamboanga del Norte, which accounts for more than 50%
of the region’s forest cover in year 2000. Zamboanga del Norte experienced a relatively high
negative net change though its starting year 2000 forest cover was roughly only 45,000 ha. It
implies that Zamboanga del Norte’s loss rate was much alarming given the relatively small
year 2000 forest cover among the provinces in Table 10. This forest loss rate could be explained

by the presence of Integrated Forest Management Agreement (IFMA) concessionaires all over

55

the province (see Figure 27). IFMA is geared towards industrial forest plantations at the

expense of natural ones. Since this southern part of Zamboanga del Norte is heavily forested,

this type of IFMA belongs to type II where a certain forestland still contain residual (open)
forest. In addition, Palawan had the highest loss rate (563. 72 ha/yr), followed by Isabela
(452.78 ha/yr) and Apayao (357.14 ha/yt). It is interesting to note that except for Palawan,
Apayao and Isabela were in the list of provinces where logging concessions were allowed to
operate until the enactment of E.O. 23. Identifying particular loss years for each provinces will
be discussed next.

‘Annual forest losses of top three provinces in terms of net changes are shown in Figure
28. This figure resembles greatly the annual forest losses of Figure 21, in which Palawan,
Isabela and Apayao are member provinces. Palawan incurred two noticeable forest loss in years
2007 and 2010 while Isabela had its peak loss in 2003. In Palawan, years 2007 and 2010
coincided with the national and local election and perhaps illegal logging activities were carried
‘out to raise funds for the said elections. But this assumptions still needs to be verified in the
field, though this was also reported in other places like in Sierra Madre, and a priest called it
as mad “cycle during elections” (Mallari, 2016). There was a conspicuous drop in forest loss
year in Palawan, after a total log ban was implemented on that year, however forest loss in year
2012 seem to go back to year 2008 and 2009 levels, denoting the violation of E.O. 23.
Meanwhile, according to Hazel Consunji, a researcher who did her field work in Isabela, the
suspension of RUPs (Resource Use Permits) are said to aggravate illegal logging on that
province. Also, five typhoons that hit the province might had an effect in increasing the forests
loss but considered to be minimal compared to the abovementioned illegal harvesting activities
done. In Apayao, forest loss increased from year 2001 to 2007 and suddenly decline in 2008
but attained its all-time high in year 2009. It can be inferred that Apayao is included in
Provinces where logging concessions were allowed, so this might be the reason for the
increasing forest loss (see Figure 22). The decline in 2008 in Apayao may be attributed in the

slobal financial crises on that year, as the low demand for wood construction materials might

caused the said decline. Nonetheless, Palawan had the biggest loss rate (563.72 ha/yr) among
the three. Again, these estimated values could be much larger in reality due to the use of the
intersected five forest vectors in this study with significant forest change relative to their

starting forest cover in year 2000.

In Table 11, Zamboanga Sibugay (-8.94%), Zamboanga del Norte (-8.10%) and
National Capital Region (6.07%) placed as first, second and third place, in mean aggregate net
change, respectively. However, the mean aggregate net change of NCR is disputed due to its
high standard deviation and coefficient of variation, hence placing Albay and Zamboanga del
Norte in the third and fourth place. This condition was the same with Table 8 as the difference
was dictated by ESSC vector. It was expected that Zamboanga provinces will appear on the
table above because Zamboanga Peninsula region topped the aggregate net change ranking in
the regional level (section 4.1.2). Nevertheless, three Zamboanga provinces bagged the top
three spots in terms of aggregate net change as this provinces allowed legal logging until 2011.
It-can be deduced that either logging concessions (for Zamboanga del Norte), slash and burn

farming and forest conversion to rubber (for Zamboanga Sibugay and Zamboanga del Sur)

59

operated quickly in replacing vast areas of forested lands. Thus resulting on their high
aggregate net changes. In Figure 29, it was evident that the said Zamboanga provinces had

twice as much aggregate net change than Albay.

On the next table, provinces ranked by forest loss rate are shown. It can be inferred that
this table contain the member provinces that were listed in Table 9. Provinces with the highest
mean loss rates were topped by Palawan (2,380.02 ha/yr), followed by Agusan del Sur
(1,693.86 ha/yr) and Cagayan (1,018.23 ha/yr). As discussed in previous sections, these
Provinces had the capability to lose more forests since these places had huge forested areas in
the first place. On one hand, it was notable that Agusan de Sur and Zamboanga del Norte, with

mean forest loss rates of 1,693.86 ha/yr and 812.02 ha/yr, respectively were also included

among the list with high aggregate net change (see Table 11). This intensifies the concern with
Tegards to the rate and amount of forests in these two provinces, especially in addressing and
creating policies to halt such rates and losses. In Table 13, forest loss rates of provinces listed
in Table 11 were presented. The list was topped by Mindanao provinces, with special focus in

Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga Sibugay which also registered high aggregate net

60

changes in Table 11. As said in previous paragraphs, this could be brought about by logging

concessions and kaingin for Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga Sibugay, respectively.

Farming based activities (slash and burn) that drives deforestation became feasible as logging

concessions open up inaccessible forests. But in this two Zamboanga provinces, it appeared

that they occur concomitantly as most of the remaining forests in Mindanao were already in

degraded or secondary state and easy to access. Therefore, these two drivers reinforce each

other to intensify the deforestation process.

The figure on the next page showed annual forest losses of top three aggregate net
changes by province. Overall annual forest losses of three provinces are shown in Figure 30a
while the individual forest losses are shown in Figure 30b. Albay’s forest losses were rather
small compared to Zamboanga Sibugay and Zamboanga del Norte. Zamboanga del Norte had
the highest forest loss forest loss rate (104.38 ha/yr) followed by Zamboanga Sibugay (6.46
ha/yr) and Albay (0.04 ha/yr). Year 2004 had the highest forest loss for Zamboanga del Norte
whereas year 2009 had the highest loss for Zamboanga Sibugay. In terms of policy effects, it
appeared that Zamboanga del Norte followed the logging suspension of 2004 and respond to
its eventual lifting later next year. Years 2003-2004 and 2007-2008 were the years were logging
in IFMA sites resumed in Zamboanga del Norte while the explanation in increasing loss from
2000-2009 in Zamboanga Sibugay is still wanting. Meanwhile, Albay had the highest loss in
year 2006 and can possibly explained by the presence of mining firms, specifically in Rapu-
Rapu Island. It is worthwhile to investigate the cause of such changes with more precision and
identify barangays where most of the changes occur. Besides, Albay’s forest loss values

demonstrates the ability of Landsat processed data to detect even minute changes in the ground.

4.1.4 Per Forest Type Portion

Table 14 below showed the distribution of forest cover types based on the forest vector
used, In this study, three forest cover types are used following the UN-FAO (FAO, 2001) land
cover classes. In NAMRIA forest vector, it used the standard UN-FAO land cover classification
while the ESSC adapted the 1987 SSC forest cover classes. In ESSC, open forest is defined by
open broadleaf while its closed forest constitutes closed broadleaf trees. It is possible that
ESSC’s closed forest is smaller than that of NAMRIA’s since some of it might be added in the
mossy or coniferous type. This is however different for NAMRIA where all broadleaf or needle
leaf type of trees are clumped in either open or closed forest type while doing the data
processing. For BSWM, only the mangrove forest class was used since it is a land use type
map. Thus, per forest type classes adapted in this portion mainly depends on the percent canopy
or crown cover rather that its tree species, These differences should be helpful in discerning

some findings on this section.

Table 14. Relative distribution of forest type per forest vectors.

"Note: NAMRIA’s closed forest includes old growth and residual dipterocarp forests and open
forest consists submarginal forests (Carandang, 2008).

In addition, intersecting the various forest cover vectors was not done since they have
different forest classes used, with different definition. Therefore, the forests here are defined
with 85 percent and up tree cover, increasing the pixels that could be tagged as non-forest due

to the absence of forest vectors’ intersection.

4.1.4.1 Closed Forest

In closed forest type, top three provinces by mean aggregate net change were Iloilo,
‘Zamboanga Sibugay and Maguindanao. High standard deviations for Iloilo (19.45) and
Maguindanao (9.29) indicate that there is a low agreement between NAMRIA and ESSC forest
vector. Perhaps, the inclusion of coniferous and mossy forest classes of ESSC has significantly
affected the values for aggregate net changes. This is supported by examining the ratio of forest
type to total forest area that varies greatly on NAMRIA and ESSC vectors. Nevertheless,
familiar provinces mentioned in previous ranking of provinces by aggregate net change such
as Zamboanga Peninsula provinces appears on the table above. Meanwhile, given

Table 15. Top provinces by average aggregate net change in closed forest (national average
aggregate net change is -1.40%).

"can be excluded from the list due to high Standard Deviation

the national aggregate net change of 1.40%, we could assume that closed forests are less
dynamic and less affected by deforestation process. Maybe, closed forests could be equated to
Protected areas or inaccessible virgin forests, especially in the mountainous provinces.

Terrestrial protected areas covers 4.06 million hectares of land (BMB, 2014).

In Tables 16 and 17, closed forest loss rates were shown based on the provinces with
highest values of loss rates and aggregate net change ranking, respectively. For these tables,

only the top five provinces based on their loss rate amounts were included. In Table 16, it was

65

illustrated that provinces with huge remaining and intact forests also had the highest closed
loss rates like Palawan, Apayao and Cagayan. Again, the low ratio of forest type to total forest
area was evident in ESSC vector due to reasons mentioned earlier. In ranking the loss rates in
terms of aggregate net changes, three provinces coming from Mindanao got the top three spots
(Surigao del Sur = 71.61 ha/yr, Zamboanga del Norte = 60.81 ha/yr and Zamboanga del Sur =
33.16 ha/yr). Obviously, their loss rates were much smaller than in Table 16, but the said
Mindanao provinces adds more urgency to put these provinces in the immediate areas of
concern list due to its high aggregate net changes and loss rates. It is also interesting to note
that closed forests are much difficult to access but deforestation in these areas continued to
pervade in the first decade of twenty first century. The next sections tackles the much easier to
access forest types, the open or secondary and mangrove forest types following the same format
of forest loss rate presentation.

4.1.4.2 Open Forest

Aggregate net change ranking in open forest is shown in the table below. Three
provinces from Zamboanga Peninsula, namely, Zamboanga Sibugay (-10.79%), Zamboanga
del Norte (-8.26%) and Zamboanga de! Sur (-7.10%) placed as first, second and third,
respectively. Ratio of forest type area to total forest area were almost similar for the said
provinces indicating a high degree of agreement between NAMRIA and ESSC forest vector.

The three provinces’ aggregate net change values were also similar as indicated by their

Table 18. Top provinces by mean aggregate net change in open forest (national mean
aggregate net change is -2.75%).

standard deviation. Compared to closed forest, open forest’s mean aggregate net changes are
relatively high which means that this forest type is more dynamic than the former. This finding
is supported by the Lasco et al. (2001) statement that indeed, open or secondary forest type is
the most dynamic type of forest due to its ease of access and large coverage. This was also
reinforced by the fact that there was a shift in logging from old growth to second growth
(residual) forests (DENR, 1991) hence, adding more pressure to these residual forests. These
areas could be former sites of logging concessions where upland farmers eventually settle for
subsistence through slash and burn agriculture and agroforestry. Hence, provinces shown here

‘might illustrate an immediate need to address deforestation in secondary forest types. The large
67

coverage of this forest type is indicated by high forest type area to forest area ratio. In ESSC
forest vector alone, the ratio could range from 0.43 to 0.71, but this pattern is different in
NAMRIA forest vector. Possibly, open forest areas have been merged to other land cover types
because NAMRA forest vector had the most number of land classes (21 compared to ESSC’s
7), which include wooded grasslands, brushlands and forest plantation. In the case of forest
plantation, it has not been included since it is not grouped into open and closed forest type.
This could be a source of variation between NAMRIA’s and ESSC’s forest type ratio.

Open forest loss rates seemed to be high in forest rich provinces like Palawan, Agusan
del Sur and Cagayan with mean forest loss rates of 1,244.25 ha/yr, 1,197.18 ha/yr and 606.48
ha/yr, respectively. All of them except for Cagayan and Isabela had a high degree of forest
vector agreement. In Table 20, though Zamboanga del Norte and Sibugay was on the top three
in terms of aggregate net change, their loss rate were comparatively small in relation to
provinces like Palawan, Apayao and Quirino. Nonetheless, three out of five provinces in Table
20 allowed logging until the implementation of logging ban in 2011. Open forest type is more
exposed to various drivers of deforestation due to their accessibility (forest
conversion/farming) and their devolved management through IFMA, SIFMA and other tenure
instrument agreements. This calls for policy review in managing the secondary forest types as
we might repeat the mistakes of the past by designating forest lands to private companies
without enough investment in natural forest cover rejuvenation due to concessionaire’s

excessive timber extraction for profit.

4.1.4.3 Mangrove Forest

Mangrove forest are mostly located along coastlines or in areas where seawater meets
fresh water coming from rivers (estuarine). Mangrove trees are usually vulnerable for fishpond
conversion or for charcoal gathering due to its high degree of tolerance to heat. In Table 21,
top three provinces include Agusan del Sur ( -13.56%), Maguindanao (- 10.13%) and Isabela
(- 4.9%). However, they had high standard deviations, which means forest vectors do not have
ahigh agreement in their mapped mangroves. If provinces with low standard deviations are
selected, provinces such as Maguindanao, Isabela and Cebu would be on top three.
Furthermore, the only provinces with high degree of agreement in the three mangrove forests
vectors were Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur and Palawan. As observed, these
Provinces were also listed in the previous tables for closed and open forests. It is also important
to note that Masbate’s major forest cover type is mangrove, with mean aggregate net change
of- 4.11% but other provinces ratio are always lower than one percent. This could be attributed

to the fact there is already small areas of mangrove in the country compared to open and closed

69

type of forest in year 2000. It is assumed that mangrove type of forest is second to open forests

in terms of forest dynamics, though it is relatively smaller in area.

In table 22, mangrove loss rates are highest in Palawan (mean FLR = 109.98 ha/yr) due
to its long coastline. This was followed by Zamboanga Sibugay (17.22 ha/yr) and Eastern
Samar (13.85 ha/yr). It was evident that Zamboanga Sibugay and Tawi-Tawi had higher forest
type proportion compared to other three provinces. Compared to other literature, provinces
such as Palawan, Zamboanga Sibugay and Zamboanga del Sur were identified by Long et al.,
(2014) with most mangrove decline from 1999-2010. These provinces were included in Tables
21-22. In terms of provinces with major mangrove extent, Palawan, Zamboanga Sibugay and
Tawi-Tawi were also identified in the mapping outputs of Long and Giri (2011). These

comparisons adds confidence to Landsat processed data in analyzing mangrove extent and loss

rate,

Since we removed Agusan del Sur in Table 21, the next top five regions by mangrove

loss rates were shown in the table below. Maguindanao had the highest mean loss rate, followed

by Isabela and Cebu. Among the top three provinces, Isabela had the lowest proportion of

mangroves while Masbate had the highest forest proportion. The presented loss rates would be

useful in establishing the baseline loss rates of mangroves from year 2000-2012.

Compared to other two forest types, open forest’s aggregate net changes were much higher

than closed and mangrove forest, ini

ating a high degree of dynamism.

In the next portion of this discussion, it will focus on provinces which have significant

annual forest loss correlations by forest type. This is presented to recognize provinces whose

annual loss could either be increasing or decreasing significantly.

In Table 24, provinces with significantly increasing annual loss in closed forest are

shown. Surigao del Sur and Surigao del Norte are the only provinces that appeared both in

NAMRIA and ESSC forest vector. Their r values ranges from 0.71 to 0.79, denoting a highly

Positive correlation.

Table 24. Provinces which have significantly increasing loss in closed forest type with
respect to year 2001-2012 period (p-value < 0.05) and their loss rate (ha/yr).

Correlation values between the two forest vectors are not far from each other, signifying
a high degree of agreement between NAMRIA and ESSC vector. Timber harvesting or land
cover conversion possibly happened on the said provinces (see Figure 22). Such causes could
be driven by policies implemented or increase in the demand side of a profitable agro-industrial

crop. Nonetheless, this trend is alarming enough to alert forest managers in the area.

In the next table, five provinces that were both present in two forest vectors for open
forest are shown. Their correlations ranges from 0.60 to 0.7 that indicates moderate to high

positive correlation. The topmost provinces are Agusan del Sur, Tarlac and Davao Oriental.

to year 2001-2012 period (p-value < 0.05) and their loss rate (ha/yr).

An in depth investigation of probable deforestation causes is needed to attribute factors such
as logging, forest conversion or kaingin farming with high certainty. It is assumed that

accessibility and small diameter classes of trees that are easy to clear contribute to the demise

BB

of open forests in these provinces. Yet, these reasons might just superficial compared to the

ultimate causes that drives deforestation in those provinces

For the mangrove forest type, no province had incurred significant annual forest loss

correlations in all the three forest vectors. However, only two provinces appeared in two forest

vectors, namely, Agusan del Norte (NAMRIA and ESSC) and Bohol (ESSC and and Bohol
(ESSC and BSWM). Correlation values in this table ranges from negative to positive (-0.65 to
-0.80). In particular, provinces like Bohol and Eastern Samar (except for Agusan del Norte and
Guimaras) experienced a high and positively increasing trend of forest loss. On the bright side,
Guimaras and Agusan del Norte a moderately negative correlation in their annual forest losses.
Somehow, efforts to control mangrove destruction were under its way during this period, but
Temote sensing derived data alone cannot explain what ultimately cause this significant decline

in mangrove forest loss. This will be explained in the next two paragraphs.

In Figure 32, graphical representation of annual closed forest losses of Surigao del Sur
and Surigao del Norte are illustrated, It seems that the mean forest loss rates and patterns for
the said CARAGA provinces are not far from each other. The year with the most loss in Surigao

del Sur and Surigao del Norte is 2012. This observation could be related to a large-scale

74


smuggling of lumber that was caught (one year after the implementation of Executive Order
23) and resulted in relieving DENR officials on that year in CARAGA and Davao Oriental
(Carandang et al., 2013). Yet, this assumptions should be validated on the ground by intensive
interviews and secondary data gathering that might add credibility to Landsat processed data.
There was an increase in the 2004 forest loss which coincided with election while the year 2011
reflects that E.O. 23 was not effective in controlling forest loss up to 2012. Interestingly, the

sudden decrease in 2009 loss is worthwhile to investigate.

For open forests (Figure 33), Agusan del Sur had the highest open forest loss rate
(NAMRIA = 1,017.4 ha/yr; ESSC = 1,376.96 ha/yr) compared to Davao Oriental (NAMRIA
= 288.32 ha/yr; ESSC = 278.51 ha/yr) and Tarlac (NAMRIA = 27.89 ha/yr; ESSC = 16.50
ha/yr). Years with the highest loss in Agusan del Sur were 2004, 2010 and 2012 while years”
2007, 2010 and 2012 for Davao Oriental. Policies such as logging permit suspension of 2004
and logging moratorium in 2011 may influence such loss patterns. Forest loss decreased,
following the log ban in 2004 but later increased in in the succeeding years as the log ban was
lifted in March 2005, while all of them responded well in the log ban of February 2011 (except
for Tarlac), but it increased again in 2012. Also, 2004, 2007 and 2010 elections, and 2008
global financial crisis could also be a factor in the high and low forest losses in the three
provinces, respectively. As year 2012 was among the peak loss years of Agusan del Sur and
Davao Oriental, the earlier said large scale lumber confiscation that happened on that year
could be a reason for such peak loss. Meanwhile, Tarlac’s peak forest loss happened in years
2010 and in 2011, despite the implementation of logging ban (E.O. 23) in 2011. Lastly, all
mangrove forest loss were less than a hectare (except for Isabela: 1.24 ha/yr). Agusan del Norte
and Guimaras mangrove loss were both highest in year 2001 and declining in succeeding years,

implying effective mangrove protection in the area. Meanwhile, Bohol, Eastern Samar and

75

Surigao del Norte had peak loss in 2012 while Isabela and Lanao del Sur had peak loss in 2010

and 2011, respectively.

4.15 Accuracy Assessment

Confusion matrices or contingency tables are presented in Tables 27-31. For Greater
Luzon’s error matrix, user’s accuracy in loss (68.19%) was much lower than that of gain
(95.38%). It means that loss detected by the Landsat derived data or map data does match with
what is actually in the reference data with 68.19% accuracy. On the other hand, producer’s
accuracy in loss implies that there is 88.86% chance that loss depicted on the reference data
not match with those in the map data. Gain’s user and producer accuracy values imply a
relatively higher level of reliability compared to loss, as shown by its higher overall accuracy
(93.52%) than that of loss (85.43%). It is assumed that validating forest loss pixels are often
hindered by limited availability of high-resolution images (Google Earth) that served as
reference image in the accuracy assessment process. Most of the time, these images are plenty
in urban centers but wanting in mountainous places, where most forests are located. With these,
the validator’s decision is to dismiss the occurrence of forest loss. In contrary, no change
(represented as no loss and no gain in the table) have higher accuracy values than loss and
gains. This could be attributed to the fact that no forest change can readily perceived in
reference data, especially when those features are located in remote and mountainous areas

(e.g. Cordillera and Sierra Madre forests).

Contrary to Greater Luzon, Greater Palawan-Mindoro’s user’s and producer’s accuracy
for gain is much lower that than of its loss. This biogeographic region’s forest is mostly
dominated by Palawan. The said province is believed to have 50% of its land area covered by
forests. With that, there is a high probability to detect forest loss in Palawan because it has
more to lose than to gain. However, when it comes to overall accuracy, forest loss has lower
value than gain. This could be influenced by no change accuracy values. Like in previous table,
itis evident that overall accuracy and kappa statistic values are similar.

Greater-Negros Panay biogeographic region has the least forest cover among the

biogeographic regions discussed in this section. Most of their forests are isolated in mountain

82

ridges (Panay) and highest peaks (Negros). Its user accuracies for loss (53.46%) are lower than
gain (72.22%). It is possible that forest loss in the map (Landsat derived data) are apparently
no change features in the reference data. Thus, loss features on this biogeographic region should
be used with caution. Meanwhile, no change accuracy values have a high degree of reliability

similar to two previously discussed tables.

Forest cover in the Greater Mindanao biogeographic region includes forests from
Bohol, Samar and Leyte islands. For its accuracy values, it was evident that user accuracy
values were almost similar with Greater-Negros Panay. For example, there was a 57.97%
probability that a forest loss from map data match the reference data as compared to 53.46 of
Negros-Panay. Gain’s user accuracy (78.08%) means that forest gain are more reliable than
forest loss. Like in the previous tables, no change features scored higher accuracies than forest
losses and gains. Overall accuracy for Greater Mindanao forest loss and gain were both less

than 90 percent.

For overall accuracy matrix, producer’s accuracy for gain and loss were greater than

that of user’s accuracy. This denotes that loss and gain features in the map data will not be

classified as the same feature for the reference data. Therefore, in using the Landsat derived

forest change data should be used with caution. This accuracy assessment exercise showed that

Landsat-derived forest cover change data have medium to high degree of reliability depending

on the biogeographic region where a particular area is found.

42 Field V: n Case Studies

Based primarily on the results presented in section 4.1, provinces belonging to
Zamboanga Peninsula region were selected to conduct field validation using various techniques
such as key informant interviews, focused group discussions and site visits. Additional
province such as Quezon was visited first to serve as the pilot site where the mentioned

validation methods in section 3.3 were tested.

4.2.1 General Nakar, Quezon

General Nakar, Quezon was the chosen municipality to serve as the testing of the
validation techniques. It is the largest municipality of Quezon province and it contains the
largest area of forested lands since it was directly connected to southern part of Sierra Madre,
and some of its forests were former logging sites of TLA holders. Three barangays were visited
in this area, namely, Magsikap, Mahabang Lalim and Pagsangahan. In KI, an arbitrary set of
Weights adapted from Bugayong et al., (2016) were designated and they were multiplied on
each of the drivers based on their scoring. According to the interviewees, the most important
direct driver of deforestation on their area was forest products harvesting (weighted score =

14.75) followed by farming (ws = 13.5), biophysical factors (ws = 13) and infrastructure (ws

85

= 625) (see Table 32). Forest product harvesting were exemplified by logging, timber
poaching, charcoal making and rattan gathering. However, the weighted scores of the first two
direct drivers have values that are not really far from each other, thus their weighted scores are
contentious. In addition, the need to clear forest before planting crops suitable for agriculture

is usually associated to kaingin or slash and bum agriculture. These could be explained by lack

of arable lands for the upland settlers. The devastation by the typhoons at the last two months
of year 2004 (Typhoon Yoyong and Winnie) has resulted to massive landslides that probably
deforested some areas of General Nakar. This experience was still fresh to the interviewees,
especially upland farmers and the reason why typhoon and landslides were deemed as

important drivers by all interviewees. On one hand, infrastructure facilities seemed to be of

86

little value when it comes to deforestation. Direct driver such as biophysical factors (typhoon
and landslides) has aggravated the need to illegally harvest and fell more trees since there was
ahigh demand for construction supplies in rebuilding their washed out houses. Overall, the top
three direct drivers are usually related to each other. As for the indirect cause or underlying
driver, the main deforestation threat was identified as economic-market driven (ws = 18.5).
Demographic-socio-cultural and policy- institutional ranked as second and third, with weighted

scores of 14 and 8, respectively. Limited livelihood sources and poverty, high price and demand

for forest products were identified as the main cause to engage in forest damaging activities
such as timber poaching and kaingin. Lack of education, population growth, migration and
landlessness were identified in the demographic-socio-cultural driver of deforestation.
Implementation problems were not seen as an influential driver, since according to the
respondents, DENR and LGU of General Nakar were stricter today, following the landslide
incidents in year 2004. Furthermore, the ranking of deforestation drivers presented here are just
indicative and mainly dependent from the sampled interviewees.

Annual forest loss graphs were interpreted by focus group discussion participants by
enabling them to identify direct drivers of deforestation on a year-to-year basis (see Figure 35).
This was done to have a general picture on what year the direct deforestation drivers operate.
However, the accuracy of this activity was limited by the knowledge and other past experiences
ofthe participants. It was also interesting to note the said graph was similar with Figure 25b of
section 4.1.2, implying that the annual loss pattern in CALABARZON mostly came from
General Nakar. Logging and timber poaching were almost present in all of the years. It was
evident that logging was absent in years 2005 and 2006, since this was the year when logging
ban was implemented in Southem Sierra Madre’s tenure instruments, following the massive
landslides brought about by three consecutive typhoons in November and December of year

2004. According to the interviewed farmers in the uplands, the typhoons and landslides served

87

as the triggering or push factor for forest reduction for years 2005 and 2006. First, landslides
were still occurring after year 2004, this could probably affected some forests, as most
landslides occurred in areas with forests, since the soil was highly saturated towards the end of
that rainy season and easily erodible (Cruz, 2013). Secondly, there was a need to replace

washed-out houses of the residents through logging. This reason is similar with

that of Carandang et al. (2013). It was also possible that Landsat processed data detected forest
loss in 2005 instead of 2004, since the revisit time of satellite is every 16 days. Also, permits
were given to affected residents to salvage cut the trees that were included in landslide debris,
4s shown in the number of registered chainsaws in 2004-2005 (see Figure 36). Unfortunately,
those permits were taken advantage of to cut standing trees in 2005 and 2006, probably to earn
a living, as no more chainsaw registrations were renewed after their expiry in 2007. Before
2005, logging was permitted to concessionaire holders especially, IFMA, and later on, logging
cancellation was implemented in December 8, 2004 (DENR, 2004). This was according to

88

account of a DENR personnel in Real, Quezon. The imposition of provincial log ban
(Provincial Ordinance No. 8 in year 2009) and E. O. 23 didn’t totally eliminate forest loss,
especially in 2012, showing the ineffectiveness of such policies. In 2004, logging permits were
cancelled in Quezon but permits to salvage the washed out logs, trees and branches as discussed
above were issued. However, these issuances had contrasting effects to each other. Thus, we

assume that polices issued by the government didn’t help to halt forest loss.

A conceptual model of deforestation for General Nakar was presented in Figure 37.
Proximate drivers were shown in black colored font while ultimate drivers are shown in red
font. In this model, relative weights of the said drivers were symbolized by their font size. For
example, economic factor had the greater weight than socio-demographic factor. Concentration
of land ownership to few families in the lowlands results to landless people, so they migrate to
uplands to eke out a living. Limited livelihood opportunities and high demand and price of
wood forces some of them to resort to illegal forest product harvesting and kaingin, often
financed by traders in the lowlands. Most of the time these occur together with population
growth and less educational attainment. In terms of policy-institutional factor, inconsistent
Policies resulted to illegal felling of trees and tenure instrument abuse (for tenure abuse
evidence see Rimban, 2005a; Rimban 2005b). These activities are intensified by the lack of
capacity and resources to protect forests and implement forest policies effectively. The ultimate

drivers influence logging and kaingin (proximate drivers) that will result in the conversion of

89

secondary forest to non-forested land. On one hand, another factor such as the occurrence of
typhoon and landslides (year 2004) served as the aggravating force for logging and timber
poaching. Natural calamities is expected to worsen the already present threats to forests such
as logging and timber poaching. Nonetheless, further research is needed in order to use this

deforestation concept and apply it to various land cover and land use modelling methods.

To show variation in time and space, forest cover animations were shown from years
2004-2007 in Figure 38 (for complete set of maps, see Appendix L). In 2004, losses were
mostly concentrated in barangays near Infanta (see yellow oval in 2004). It was evident that
there was a huge increase in forest loss in years 2005 and 2006 in almost all the barangays, but
it was more conspicuous in Umiray (see yellow oval in year 2007). Apparently, this could be
caused by both logging (as a result of issuance to salvage and process large volume of washed
ut trees, logs and branches) and landslides. As discussed, perhaps it is possible for the
algorithm of Landsat processed data to detect forest loss right after the year of Winnie and

Yoyong typhoon because the Eastern side of Luzon are always contaminated by clouds brought

91

by the wet season and typhoons. Even if this was true, there is a high possibility that losses in
2006 was caused by uncontrolled felling because the amount of forest loss were almost the

same with 2005.

In addition, based from the figure below, it showed that General Nakar is covered by
Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) and two parcels of CBFM (Community Based
Forest Management Agreement). Perhaps, the logs that were washed out came from boundary
dispute of Nakar and Dingalan, a municipality of Aurora, Nonetheless, allegations of logging

outside the concession area were considered also as illegal logging.

Figure 39. 2012 General Nakat Forest Cover with CADT and CBFM boundaries.

The next section will investigate deforestation process in Kabasalan, a second class

municipality in Zamboanga Sibugay. Only two barangays were visited, namely, Sanghanan

92

and Tampilisan. Like in General Nakar, the said barangays were located in the uplands and

former TLA areas.

4.2.2 Kabasalan, Zamboanga Sibugay

For Kabasalan, Zamboanga Sibugay, the number one direct driver identified was
farming, specifically kaingin. There was a 6.75 weighted score difference between the number
cone (farming, ws = 18) and number two direct driver (forest product harvesting, ws = 11.25).
Allof the 18 interviewees identified activities such as kaingin as the main direct driver example
of farming, while second to this was conversion of forest to rubber plantation (13 respondents).
Then, others had identified that logging and timber poaching as the primary example of forest
product harvesting. The next proximate drivers were biophysical (ws = 7.5) and infrastructure
(ws = 7). Infrastructure development was identified as the least influential direct driver since
there were limited infrastructure facilities in Kabasalan. It is interesting to note that drought
played an important role in reducing the forest cover in the area (the reason will be explained
in the next section). On this field work, like in General Nakar, logging and timber poaching
were designated as two separate activities since the former is related to legal timber harvesting
while the latter is illegal. Like Nakar, this area was a former logging site. The main ultimate
driver identified was of economic-market factor (ws = 16.5). This was followed by
institutional-policy (ws = 10.5) and demographic-socio-cultural (ws = 9.75). Economic factors
like limited livelihood posed similarly with General Nakar. However, high demand and price
for rubber was deemed as another significant cause that drived deforestation in Kabasalan.
Peace and order issues, together with implementation problems, were also recognized as
another important driver in the policy-institutional factor of deforestation. Implementation
problems were highlighted by the lack of manpower and logistics of protecting the open access
forests which mostly comprise the uplands. As for the least significant cause, lack of education,

93

landlessness, migration and population growth are said to be the most important in the
demographic-socio-cultural cause of deforestation. Compared to General Nakar, there is a
clear-cut evidence that forest loss in Kabasalan is largely driven by farming or agriculture (as
proximate factor). For its ultimate cause of deforestation, Kabasalan respondents recognized
economic-market causes, the same with General Nakar. Again, the said findings were just
indicative of deforestation drivers in the area. The results of KIl are highly influenced by the
number of respondents and to the barangays where they reside. In addition, it is possible that
these results will vary depending on the municipality visited. Therefore, these results just

showed a small glimpse of deforestation dynamics of Zamboanga Sibugay province.

Crisis

In Kabasalan’s annual forest loss graph, kaingin was always present in all of the years
of the study period (see figure above). Years 2004 and 2005 have the highest recorded area of
forest loss, probably due to kaingin. According to our interviewees, the years 2004-2005 (Null,
2016) was conducive for kaingin due to the occurrence of weak El Nifio on that year. Years
2007 and 2010 were categorized as moderate El Nifio years while 2006-2007 as weak ones.
Hence, the occurrence of this climatic cycle in the Pacific Ocean somehow affected
deforestation process through kaingin. In relation to farming as direct deforestation driver, it
involves a three-step process (see Figure 41). First, a secondary type of forest is burned and
cleared. Next, agricultural crops such as rice, corn and vegetables were planted. Then, the final
stage is the establishment of rubber plantation after the said cash crops were harvested as
conversion to rubber were also present to some of the years. This observation was similar to
the chain-logics causation mode of Geist & Lambin (2001). In 2011, there has been a decrease
in forest loss and this was mainly attributed to the enactment of Executive Order 23. However,

there was a slight increase in forest loss a year later, illustrating a backslash of the policy. Like

95

in General Nakar, natural calamities such as drought served as the trigger to further kangin in
Kabasalan, Zamboanga Sibugay. Without this, probably, the annual loss graph would be
different. Such phenomenon will be explained more in the next portion of this discussion by

presenting the conceptual model of deforestation of Kabasalan.

Figure 41. Forest Conversion Process in Kabasalan, Zamboanga Sibugay.

In Figure 42, deforestation in Kabasalan is mainly driven by several ultimate causes,
namely, landlessness, limited livelihood, high demand and price of rubber (Economic-Market);
peace and order problems, open access forests, weak forest protection, lack of resources,
Policy Institutional); and lack of education, migration and population growth (Socio-
Demographic). Then, these ultimate factors influence the three main proximate causes, which
are kaingin, conversion to rubber (Farming) and timber poaching (Forest Product Harvesting).
An aggravating deforestation driver, drought (weak El Nifio in 2004-05, 2006-07, moderate El
Nifio 2009-10) intensified the occurrence of kaingin which is another example of direct cause

of forest loss. Thi

s similar with that of General Nakar, though the latter has typhoon and
landslides that enabled further cutting of trees. This similar event in the two municipalities

emphasizes the si

cance and role of biophysical factors such as calamities in shaping

deforestation dynamics on a particular area. Landlessness in the lowlands results to migration

in the uplands previously occupied by logging concessions. Since livelihood options were
limited and there was an industry (Kabasalan had several rubber plantations in the lowlands)

and continuing demand for rubber, some upland people practice kaingin and eventually convert

secondary forests to either rubber trees or farming parcels. Peace and order was said to be one

of the major hindrances in effectively managing the forests of Kabasalan by LGU and DENR,

especially when it comes to timber poaching/illegal logging. Also, there were no effective
forest protection and monitoring activities (due to lack of capacity and resources) of local
people, LGU and DENR since there were no in place tenure instrument in most of the forest in
the uplands (see Figure 42), thus resulting to de facto open access condition of Kabasalan’s
forests. Socio-demographic factors just worsen the said ultimate deforestation drivers. These
were the factors and processes that lead to conversion of the already fragmented forests of

Kabasalan to non-forested land.

For the change maps (Figure 44), it can be seen that the sudden increase in loss was
almost widespread among the forest areas Kabasalan in year 2004. Then it was followed by
2005 but its loss was much lesser than 2004. As observed, the boundaries of tenure instrument

such as CBFMA and CADT had forests that experienced forest loss. However, upon inspection

97

of the tenure details, it was found out that the said CFMAs and CADTs were not in the political
jurisdiction of Kabasalan but still included in its geographical jurisdiction (CBFMA were in
‘Naga, Zamboanga Sibugay while CADT was in Zamboanga del Norte). This findings in the
maps could be explained by the disputes in the political boundaries delineation of provinces,

municipalities and barangays under the century old cadastral survey program. It was noticeable

that SIFMA (Socialized Industrial Forest Management Agreement) didn’t cover any forested

lands. The displayed maps showed that there was a variation in the distribution of forest loss
patches, but nonetheless, such losses were almost widespread. This is similar to what Mertens
and Lambin (1997) defined as diffuse deforestation pattern, attributed to smallholder,

traditional subsistence agriculture as shown below.

The next part will discuss the last municipality visited for the field validation, Siocon.
This municipality belongs to another Zamboanga Peninsula province, Zamboanga del Norte.
Remember that Zamboanga del Norte placed second in terms of provincial mean aggregate net

change ranking. The first placer is Zamboanga Sibugay.

4.2.3 Siocon, Zamboanga del Norte

Farming and forest product harvesting were tied in the number one spot as direct drivers
of deforestation in Siocon (see Table 35). In the conduct of interview, it was found out that half
of the participants point out farming while the other half is for the forest product extraction.
Both of the indirect drivers have weighted scores of 13.5. Particularly, interviewees from the
LGU and DENR had contrasting reasons for forest loss in Siocon. The LGU personnel together
with some other farmers were for the timber harvesting-driven-forest loss while DENR
personnel pointed farming activities as reasons for forest cover decline. Logging (15) and
timber poaching (14) had the highest frequencies in the forest product harvesting factor while
kaingin (13) and conversion to rubber/palm oil/exotic timber (8) had the highest frequency in
agriculture/farming driven deforestation. The said factor were trailed by infrastructure (ws =
6.75) and biophysical cause of deforestation (5.25). The primary actors in deforestation were
determined to be IFMA tenure holders (logging) and upland farmers (kaingin). It could be also
implied that logging entailed some direct drivers like infrastructure (road construction), which
possibly results to erosion/landslides. Opening up forests through construction of logging roads
might also result to more migrants settling in the uplands, as the forests became easily
accessible to them. Thus, this can be a mode of chain logics of causation (see Figure 45a). On
the other hand, it was plausible that logging and kaingin drives deforestation concomitantly

(sce Figure 45b) as these two might operate independently with each other. When it comes to

100

the indirect drivers, like in the previous sites, economic-market factor was deemed as the most

influential cause of forest cover reduction (ws = 14), trailed behind by demographic-socio-

cultural (ws = 10.5) and policy-institutional cause (ws = 9.5). These finding adds vital argument

that economics could have a significant control on the possible fate of the forests. For all of

the municipalities discussed, limited sources of livelihood were recognized concepts that are

related to economic-driven deforestation.

In contrast, this only holds true for the visited provinces, as we could never be sure
whether this is also the reality to other forested places in the Philippines. It can be inferred that
some ultimate drivers could also affect deforestation significantly. Some examples, could be
landlessness (because of weak land reform) and absence of any development intervention from
the government like industry and enterprise development that could turn away people in
practicing short fallow kaingin. On one hand, it might be possible that IFMA, as a type of
tenure instrument, caters greatly to wealthy corporations as they sought industrial type of forest
‘management and exploitation in the form of logging and planting of palm oil. IFMA was still
geared to a more extractive type of lease agreement by establishing industrial forest plantations
at the expense of secondary forests, ensuring a steady supply of wood and non-wood products
(DENR, 1999). Though the name has changed, IFMA can be similar in TLAs due to its
industrial driven nature. This insight will be discussed more in the annual forests loss analysis
of the next paragraph.

In the next figure, it could be said that the significant direct driver could be the logging
activities that was carried out by IFMA holders in 2003, 2004, 2007 and 2008. Siocon’s
Community Environment and Natural Resources Officer (CENRO) said that these activities
Were permitted during those years. Logging operation was stopped during 2005 and 2006
because of the cancellation of logging permits in Quezon and suspension to the rest of the

‘Country (DENR, 2004) due to the calamities that struck the eastern side Luzon, the mentioned

102

typhoons that hit and caused landslides in General Nakar, and other eastem seaboard
municipalities of Quezon and Aurora. As a result, forest loss definitely became lower in year
2005 and 2006. Still, logging operations were later resumed for years 2007 and 2008 since the
suspension was lifted by DENR. Timber extractions were carried out in IFMA concessions. As
we passed through the logging roads of the IFMA holder, logged over areas were planted by
palm oil and not by timber species. Conversion to plantation now includes palm oil, joining the
ranks of fast growing exotic species such as Mahogany, Mangium and Falcata. Kaingin was
still present in most of the years but compared to the extent of legal logging this was negligible.

The logging ban in 2011 evidently lowered the area of deforested land but it increased the

following year. The above figure, reiterates the impact of forest policies in forests through state
regulated logging operations. This forest management approach may continue up to year 2032
since the tenure holder started its operations in 2007 (IFMA has a 25 year contract renewable

for another 25 years).

The deforestation model of Sicon below is somewhat similar to Kabasalan though some
drivers were added. For instance, high demand for wood (for construction material) and land
(for palm oil establishment) was added as example of economic-market factor of forest loss.
Like in previous deforestation model, font sizes represent relative weights based on the results
of key informant interviews. Contrary to Kabasalan, deforestation is caused directly by forest
products harvesting than farming, exemplified by logging. This is explained mainly by the
presence of various IFMA holders in secondary forests not only in Siocon, but whole forested
portions of Zamboanga del Norte as well. The extractive and industrial type of forest
management devolved to private corporations might repeat the same old process of forests
opening up and big and marketable trees being extracted by the said companies. As the
production sharing agreement expires, the denuded forest land will be the site for migrant for
subsistence agriculture. This condition completes the whole deforestation process, as what had

happened in the past through TLAs. Another difference is that former forested lands were now

‘Nevertheless, tenure name had changed but the end goal of utilizing forests for revenue and

104

profit had not. In the said diagram, the contention about the main driver of forest decline in
Siocon clearly points to logging, only that kaingin and timber poaching worsens and completes
the deforestation process. Unlike General Nakar and Kabasalan no aggravating driver was
present to intensify forest loss rather the combination of policy and economic-market related
indirect drivers that worked hand in hand to facilitate such environmental degradation.

Forest cover maps from 2003 to 2010 were shown in Figure 48. These years were
selected to highlight the observable forest loss in Siocon. Tenure boundaries were also overlaid
with the maps. In 2003, it was possible that the encircled losses came from road construction
as they had linear characteristic (see yellow ovals). This continued up to 2006. This was also
observable in nearby municipalities such as Tungawan and Sirawai. IFMA concession covered
most of Siocon’s forests, so presumably they were the ones responsible for such changes. From
2006 to 2007, there were huge forest losses coming from the forests inside Siocon and
Tungawan (see yellow ovals). This pattern continued up to 2009 and 2010, though the latter
year had its losses in the fringes of the forests. In this map inspection, we can assume the IFMA
was the main actor that could be held responsible for such losses due to their bigger coverage
in contrast to CBFMA and CADT, though losses were also occurring in latter tenure
instruments. Forest losses were not only confined in Siocon as these were also occurring in the
nearby municipalities. From the maps, losses could possibly happening in the industrial scale,
thus this dismisses the notion that kaingin activities had an equal impact with logging in forest
cover reduction. In fact, the resources and capability of IFMA holders (since they are big
corporations) to decrease forest cover is not comparable to the ability of small time farmers
doing kaingin. Kaingin just makes the condition worse, since it cannot be denied that road
construction and felling of large forested areas facilitates easier access for slash and burn

farming. Thus, logging of IFMA holders was the main factor in Sicon’s forest decline.

4.2.4 Focus Group Discussions’ Deforestation Drivers Summary

In Table , forest product harvesting still ranked as number one direct deforestation
driver, followed both by farming and biophysical driver (both ranked as second), and
infrastructure as the least important driver. Nonetheless, economic-market factor was the
greatest forest loss driver compared to policy institutional and socio-demographic-cultural
which are both tied in second place. Since the ranking activities in the group discussion did not
follow the procedure strictly, some drivers had the same ranking while the others didn’t have
any. It indicates the diverse conditions on each of the validated sites that are distinct to others.
For example, direct drivers such as infrastructure and biophysical were not included in the
ranking in Zamboanga del Norte, implying that such deforestation drivers were virtually
absent. On the other hand, both economic-market and socio-demographic-cultural factors
ranked first in General Nakar, denoting that equal importance were given to the said drivers.

Also, this situation indicates the concomitant occurrence of such drivers in deforestation.

4.3 Correlation to Forestry Statistics
Various forestry statistics were collated and correlated to annual forest loss and annual

forest cover. The tables below were presented and discussed from national down to provincial

level.

The table above showed that annual lumber production (0.66) and annual roundwood
production (0.62) had moderate to high positive association to annual forest loss. These were
significant at p-value < 0.05 while the other forestry statistics were not. It suggests that high
volumes of lumber and roundwood production could mean significant amounts of forests being
depleted. This notion is logical since such forestry statistics reflect directly the pressure on
forests whether trees are cut illegally or legally, or from plantation or natural forests. Moreover,

the moderately negative relationship of Community Based Forest Management (CBFM, r

0.59) to forest loss shows the importance to lessen the threats to forests. CBFM program of the
government perhaps is focused on regenerating or protecting the forests instead of harvesting
the remaining trees, especially the secondary growth forests,

In analyzing correlation results to annual forest cover. It must be always noted that
forest cover derived from the Landsat processed data was in decreasing trend brought about by
deducting the annual forest loss from the starting forest cover of year 2000. Thus, there is a
cumulative decline in forest cover because gains do not outweigh forest losses. The effects of
this condition was encountered in the following discussions below.

As expected, lumber production and roundwood production were negatively correlated
with forest cover from year 2000-2012. This was also exemplified by prices and volume of
lumber exports from that period. This pattern was intuitive as larger exports and production of
forest products entailed a decrease in forest cover. But this notion should be interpreted
carefully, as mentioned earlier, forest cover is in decreasing manner. Furthermore, it was
Possible that most forest loss and forests cover values were modified considerably given the

use of all forest vectors through intersection and the tree cover thresholding of 85% and up.

110

Also, annual log requirement (0.74) was positively correlated to forest cover, so this could
demonstrate a feedback mechanism where sawmills" log requirement also declined with the

dwindling forest cover. Meanwhile, IFMA (Integrated Forest Management Agreement, r = -

0.90) had a moderately negative positive relationship to forest cover. This was in contrast with
CBFM and Tree Farm and Agroforestry Farm Lease (TFAFL), which correlations were
Positively associated to forest cover. This could mean that CBFM and TFAFL characterize a
more regenerative and protective type of forest management while IFMA is more of extractive.
However, the correlations are just indicative and needs further studies to confirm the
abovementioned assumption. In addition, the coverage of tenured areas did not necessarily
coincide with the location of the analyzed forests in the Landsat processed data. It also should

be noted that most of the forests in the country are open access and usually do not have any

Wi

tenure instruments in place, The next portion will draw more insight regarding such

correlations.

43.2 Per Region

In Table 27, log and lumber production were positively and moderately associated to
forest loss in Western Visayas (0.62), while lumber production was highly correlated in
SOCCSKARGEN (0.88). On the other hand, Ilocos Region had a negative relationship with
forest loss while forest loss in Central Luzon was negatively correlated to annual log
requirement of sawmills. It is possible that as forest loss increases, log and lumber production
also increases in Western Visayas. However, it should be kept it mind that the place of origin
of the said lumber and logs could never be surely ascertained. It was plausible that these logs
came from other neighboring islands of Westem Visayas. Meanwhile, regions such as
MIMAROPA’s (1), CALABARZON’s (0.90), Western Visayas’s (0.71) and Central Visayas’
(0.59) SIFMA areas were positively associated to forest loss, meaning, as reduction in forest
area increases, SIFMA areas on this region also rise. It is logical to infer this trend because

SIFMA is primarily geared towards the increase in supply of wood and other forest products

(DENR, 1996). On the contrary, CAR’s and SOCCSKSARGEN’s correlation values for
SIFMA were negatively correlated to forest loss. Possibly, SIFMA areas were declining on
these regions but some other drivers of deforestation may still be prevailing. In IFMA
correlations, it was evident that ARMM (0.82), CARAGA (0.67) and Zamboanga Region
(0.73) were positively correlated to forest loss. In CARAGA, this was particularly true due to
the established forest plantations in the said region. Like in SIFMA, this is intuitive since part
of the said production sharing agreement is primarily for industrial forest plantation
establishment (DENR, 1999). This was the opposite concerning the correlation in
MIMAROPA (-0.96). Such correlations should be interpreted with appropriate caution, since
deforestation is not only limited to simple timber harvesting but to some other direct drivers as
well. This includes timber-poaching, calamities, and agricultural expansion and their
interaction to more powerful underlying factors discussed earlier in section 4.2. In addition,
case studies should be done in the mentioned tenure areas to assess those assumptions in the
field. Contrary to SIFMA and IFMA, forest losses were negatively correlated to CBFM and
TFAFL. Maybe, the notion that CBFM and TFAFL assists in halting deforestation is somewhat
true, but this needs to be validated. It is possible that there are limited occurrences of timber
felling in CBFM and TFAFL for these programs promote forest cover enhancement through

Teforestation by communities. Naturally grown and planted trees harvests had positive

113

correlation with forest loss in Western Visayas (0.85) while Ilocos Region had a negative
association (-0.59). Estimated logging waste also had a positive correlation (0.86) to forest loss
in Western Visayas.

The next table summarizes significant correlations between forestry statistics and forest
cover from years 2000-2012. Forest production statistics illustrated mostly a negative
relationship to forest cover (except for annual lumber production). It implies that most of forest
production areas spatially coincided with the analyzed and post- processed Landsat data. Like
in forest loss correlations, SIFMA and IFMA had most regions where their correlations had
negative relationship with forest cover. This is contrary with CBFM and TFAFL were most of
the regions had negatively moderate to high association to forest cover. Nonetheless, with this
data, it can be inferred that CBFM and TFAFL have decreased in the study period because
forest cover presented here are always in decreasing patter. Partly, it is possible that as the
areas of industrial based tenure instruments (e.g. IFMA and SIFMA) increase, forest cover

decreases, while the opposite happens with community-based tenure instruments like CBFM

and TFAFL. This was also observed for forest loss. Unsurprisingly, the volumes for naturally
grown and planted trees together with estimated logging wastes had negative association to
forest cover. This was also revealed in the time period correlation. Possibly, since spearman
method was used for all correlations (except for the time period), correlation results might be

less robust, for the said method is non-parametric in nature compared to pearson.

43.3 Per Province

Correlation in the provincial level might recognized some provinces with significant
relationships to various forestry statistics. It was evident that the number of forestry statistics
Presented here were less than that of the national and per region correlation results. These were
Presented in Tables 40 and 41.

Annual log production was positively associated in Negros Oriental (0.66) while it was
negatively associated in Abra (-0.65) and Maguindanao (-0.62). In terms of lumber production,
there were more provinces that had negative correlation to forest loss such as Capiz,
Compostela Valley, Davao Oriental, Misamis Oriental, Negros Occidental and Pangasinan
than in provinces with positive correlation (Agusan del Norte, Benguet and Davao del Sur).
This is counterintuitive compared with the per region results, but some factors might
contributed to this result. Again, the place of origin for lumber and logs may come from other
places aside from the provinces presented. Also, the way the Landsat processed data were
analyzed could have a considerable effect particularly in using the intersection of all five forest
vectors. However, it is interesting to note that Agusan del Norte and Davao del Sur had a
significant number of regularly active sawmills within the study period. However, there were
no significant results to the annual log requirement of active regular sawmills. Perhaps, the data
regarding annual log requirement per province is not enough, so correlations cannot be
Performed. On the other hand, forest reduction was positively and moderately correlated to
SIFMAs of Cagayan (0.65), Nueva Ecija (0.68) and Pangasinan (0.67) while IFMAs in Davao
del Sur (-0.68) and Iloilo (-0.70) had negative and moderate correlation values to forest loss. It

may imply that as IFMA areas are decreasing, forest loss might increase because tenure

116

instruments provides forest protection within the period of tenure. Zamboanga del Norte was
not detected in this data, probably because applications for IFMA were in the latter years of
2000-2012 period. This was exemplified by a certain IFMA holder in the said province where
its operations just started in 2007, the year when its application was approved. Thus, forestry

correlations that extend beyond the study period should be performed.

Forest cover had a significant and negative correlation to the annual log production of
eight provinces. This was the opposite for Ilocos Norte (0.77) and Surigao del Sur (0.77) while
Sarangani (0.68) was the only province with annual lumber production which had a positive

relationship to forest cover. It is possible that there were no significant timber processing that

17

occurred within those provinces, but some deforestation drivers were still active as testified by
the declining forest cover in the majority of the provinces. Again, no provinces exhibited
significant relationship between annual log requirement, as the annual log requirement data
could be lacking. In SIFMA and IFMA, provinces which correlations were negatively
correlated to forest cover were Bataan, North Cotabato, Palawan, Pangasinan, Quirino; Negros
Occidental, Zambales and Zamboanga del Norte, respectively. On the other hand, more
provinces had a positive relationship to forest cover when it comes to IFMA (see Table 41). As
mentioned, tenure instruments bring forest protection within the period of the concession. This

could be possibly true to TFAFL as well, as illustrated in the table above.

CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

In this study, deforestation trends in the national, regional and provincial levels were
quantified by further processing the Landsat processed data and forest vectors (circa 2000)
from year 2000-2012. Such processing techniques are robust and replicable by other
researchers. In addition, regions and provinces with significant forest cover decline are
identified such as Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga Sibugay, which both belong to Region
IX (Zamboanga Peninsula). Zamboanga del Norte was the province identified with both high
aggregate net change and forest loss rates. Among the forest cover types analyzed, it was found
out that the open forest or secondary type forests were the most dynamic, which experienced
the highest aggregate net change among the three forest types analyzed. This confirmed the
study of Lasco et al. (2001) that secondary forests are the most threatened, since it is the largest,
and the remaining major source of wood in the country.

Through the field validation and accuracy assessment activities done, several insights
and findings were found out. First, the post-processed Landsat processed data had a medium
to high degree of reliability depending on the place where forested areas are analyzed. Also,
the usage of such data should be used with appropriate caution because the forest definition
greatly depends on the processing techniques such as treecover2000 thresholding and the use
of the all five forest vectors. In addition, it is possible that gains were substantially undetected
since forest growth can hardly be seen by the Landsat processed data.

In validating the drivers of deforestation, it showed that direct and indirect factors of
forest decline vary geographically (Geist & Lambin, 2002), depending on the places visited.
However, biophysical phenomena such drought and typhoons served as a triggering or push
factor to the already prevailing causes of deforestation in a specific area. With the use of the

Landsat derived data, the cause of forest reduction were identified through interviews and

119

discussions. Therefore, remote sensing data coupled with socio-economic based ground
validation further enhanced our understanding of the complex processes of deforestation.
However, there is no doubt that drivers that are anthropogenic in nature (logging and farming)
are the main reasons for forest decline. Based from the sites visited, forest decline was largely
driven by economic-market factors. Such factor connotes the daily challenges of upland
farmers to eke out living in the fragile forest ecosystems just to survive (i. e. observed in
General Nakar and Kabasalan). The country’s high demand for timber and forest conversion
to agro-industrial products (palm oil for export) also pose significant threat to forests (observed
in Siocon).

The correlation analysis of different forest statistics found out that forest production is
significantly correlated to forest loss and forest cover. In addition, forest tenure instruments
showed interesting correlation concerning forest loss and forest cover trend. Such findings
drew new understanding in relating deforestation pattems to the impact such tenure instruments
to our forests. Indeed, regions and provinces were identified to pinpoint areas with significant
correlations.

Thus, it is recommended to use an enhanced version (with minimal errors) of the
Landsat derived forest cover data in conjunction with other geospatial data (especially high-
resolution images) to learn more about forest and other vegetation dynamics that occurred in
various parts of the country from the last decade. In addition, the last three years (2013 to 2015)
can now be analyzed but validation should be done first because Hansen et al. (2013) algorithm
was not tailored fit for Landsat 8. In addition, the accuracy assessment results of the Landsat
derived data should be improved using updated and commercially available high-resolution
data,

Deforestation drivers that are presently occurring in the field should be validated with

More precision by including greater number of key stakeholders in the interviews and

120

discussions. On the other hand, the days for site visits should be lengthen so that a systematic
method for validating the loss pixels from Landsat derived data can be performed in the ground.
In addition, consumption patterns, farming systems and institutional dynamics can be also
included in the field validation to produce a highly detailed deforestation model for a particular
area.

Based from the study, institutions planning (or currently implementing) conservation
and development programs on the three study sites should consider first the source of income
of the community. This is because deforestation is significantly driven by limited livelihood
opportunities on their area. Also, it was found out that inconsistent imposition of forest policies
significantly affects deforestation trends. Thus, policies should be studied well before
implementing them; as for example, instead of decreasing forest loss, log bans often had
perverse effects.

Lastly, tenure instruments which are highly extractive (IFMA and SIFMA) should be
reviewed and analyzed rigidly before granting a particular forestland to the applicants. Based
from the study, community driven tenure instruments (which are less extractive and more
regenerative) are highly and negatively associated to forest loss. Therefore, the government
should consider adding, strengthening and revitalizing the existing community-based programs
