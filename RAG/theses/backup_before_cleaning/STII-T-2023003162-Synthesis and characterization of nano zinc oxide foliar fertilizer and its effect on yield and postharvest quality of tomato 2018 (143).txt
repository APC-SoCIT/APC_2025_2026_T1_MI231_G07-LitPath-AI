ABSTRACT

This research work primarily aimed to optimize the synthesis parameters of nano
zinc oxide using a simple precipitation technique that is ideal for large-scale and cost-
effective production. The results of the characterization tests verified the successful
synthesis of nano-sized ZnO (45 nm via SEM-EDX Spectroscopy) with low degree of
aggregation and high chemical purity (59% Zn via EDS; 90.39% ZnO via XRF
Spectroscopy). FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the Zn and O bonds. The
synthesized nano ZnO (SNZ) was therefore an ideal source of Zn foliar fertilizer for
tomato. The performance of SNZ as foliar fertilizer was tested on pot-grown tomato (var
‘Marimax’), and compared with bulk-size ZnO (BZ), commercial nano ZnO (CNZ), and
granular Zinc sulfate (ZS). Boric acid was incorporated to a separate set of the Zn foliar
treatments in order to determine the synergistic effects of Zn and B on the yield and
postharvest quality of tomato. The SNZ+B treatment resulted in a positive response in
terms of plant height, number of clusters per plant, SPAD units, number of leaves, flowers,
and fruits per plant, percent fruit set, Zn and B uptake, dry matter yield and marketable
yield. Foliar application of SNZ+B also led to significant improvements in fruit quality, including higher TSS, %TA, and Vitamin C content.

INTRODUCTION

Micronutrient deficiency is one of the major limiting factors for crop production,
particularly in vegetable production. Tomato, being the second most important vegetable in the
Philippines and planted to an estimated 17,000 ha with a volume of production of 176,000 MT
valued at more than 4 billion pesos (www.bas.gov.ph), is susceptible to micronutrient
deficiency. Among the microelements, boron and zinc play important roles directly and
indirectly in improving the yield and quality of tomato, in addition to lowering disease incidence
and physiological disorders (Magalhaes et al., 1980).

Zinc mainly functions as the metal component of a series of enzymes. Zinc deficiency
is known to restrict RNA synthesis, which in turn inhibits the synthesis of proteins that are
involved in many biochemical pathways, and even affecting photosynthesis (Tsonev and Lidon,
2012). Inadequate Zn levels in crops can manifest as stunted plant growth, decreased number
of tillers, chlorosis and smaller leaves, increased crop maturity period, spikelet sterility and
inferior quality of harvested products. (Hafeez, 2013). Boron deficiency, on the other hand,
contributes to carbohydrate metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis, meristem growth, and therefore
affects fruit shape, yield, and shelf life (Demoranville & Deubert, 1987).

Zn and B can be supplied to tomatoes as dry fertilizer in the soil. However, dry
formulations are difficult to manage because typically very small amounts, usually in ppm, are
required. Thus, these nutrients are subject to loss by leaching, and the range of deficient to toxic
levels of these heavy metals in soil is very narrow (Reisenauer et al., 1973). Farmers are using

both sulfates and chelated Zn (with EDTA) for soil and foliar applications of Zinc. However,

As evident from the results of the pot experiment, SNZ enhanced the agronomic
effectiveness of Zn foliar fertilizers. Nano-scaling has made ZnO more available to
nanoscale plant pores and therefore resulted in efficient nutrient use. The decreased
particle size also resulted in increased number of particles per unit weight of applied Zn,
while increasing the specific surface area of the fertilizer, which increased the inherently
low dissolution rate of ZnO in water thus enhancing the uptake by the plant. The ultimate
result was the enhanced growth yield and postharvest quality of tomato. The addition of
Boron on the Zn foliar fertilizer also resulted to a significant improvement in the

effectiveness of the foliar fertilizers.

the efficacy is low. Therefore, an efficient mechanism to reduce the amount of Zn and B
fertilizer application without compromising the plant growth and yield is very essential. Foliar
fertilization has the advantage over soil application in terms of low application rates, uniform
distribution and quick plant responses to applied nutrients (Umer et al., 1999; Mengel, 2002).

Nanotechnology is the design, characterization, production and application of structures,
devices and systems by controlling shape and size at nanometer scale. In recent years, the
application of nanoparticles of plant nutrients is being preferred to enhance the uptake by plants.
Particle size may affect agronomic effectiveness of Zn and B fertilizers. Decreased particle size
results in increased number of particles per unit weight of applied Zn and also increases the
specific surface area of a fertilizer, which will increase the dissolution rate of fertilizers with
low solubility in water such as Zn oxide (ZnO) (Mortvedt et al,1992).

In this study, it was hypothesized that ZnO nanoparticles in combination with Boron, is
more efficient as foliar fertilizer for tomato in terms of improving growth and yield, compared
to the conventionally used ZnSO4. The second hypothesis for this study was that the application
of nano ZnO and B can improve the postharvest quality of tomato. Therefore, this study
primarily aimed to generate new information on the effectiveness of nano zinc oxide in

combination with Boron on the growth, yield, and postharvest quality of tomato.

OBJECTIVES

The general objective of this study was to synthesize Zinc oxide nanoparticles, and
utilize it in combination with Boron as foliar fertilizer for tomato in order to enhance the plant
growth, yield and postharvest quality.

Specific Objectives:

Activity 1. Synthesis and characterization of zinc oxide nanoparticles.

The first part of the study aimed to accomplish the following:
1. to produce nano-sized ZnO particles in the laboratory using a simple precipitation

method that is ideal for low-cost, large scale production;

2. to characterize the properties of ZnO nanoparticles in terms of particle size, chemical

purity, percent yield, and surface morphology using instrumentation techniques;

Activity 2. Application of synthesized nano-ZnO as foliar fertilizer for tomato

The second part of the experiment aims to accomplish the following:

1. to formulate foliar fertilizer suspensions using ZnO nanoparticles and Boron;

2. to determine the growth and yield response of tomato to the varying formulations of

nanofoliar fertilizers applied.

3. to compare the nanofoliar versus conventional foliar fertilizer; in terms of their effect

on growth and yield parameters.

Activity 3. Evaluation of postharvest quality of harvested tomato as influenced by nano

ZnO foliar fertilizers

The third and final part of the experiment aimed to accomplish the following:
1. to evaluate the physical and chemical characteristics of the harvested tomatoes; and
2. to determine the effect of varying formulations of the foliar fertilizers on the

postharvest qualities of tomato.

Conceptual Framework of the Study

This study was divided into three activities namely: Synthesis and characterization of
zinc oxide nanoparticles (Activity 1); Application of synthesized nano-ZnO as foliar fertilizer
for tomato (Activity 2) and; Evaluation of postharvest quality of harvested tomato as influenced
by nano ZnO foliar fertilizers (Activity 3). Activity 1 aimed to optimize the synthesis method
parameters for nano zinc oxide and to characterize the synthesized nano zinc oxide
nanoparticles in terms of particle size, chemical purity, percent yield, and surface morphology.
Activity 2 was the testing of the performance of the synthesized nano ZnO and B on pot-grown
tomato wherein initial soil characterization was done before the implementation of treatments.
During the treatment implementation, optimum field management was observed to cancel the
effect of other factors.

Growth and yield parameters were measured which reflect the response of the tomato
plants to the treatments applied. The postharvest parameters i.e. juice pH, Total Soluble Solids
(TSS), titratable acidity (“TA), firmness and Vitamin C, as affected by the treatments were
also assessed in Activity 3. The growth parameters, yield components, and postharvest quality
were used to determine the effectiveness of the treatments applied in improving the yield and
quality of tomato.

Understanding the characteristics and chemistry of the foliar fertilizers applied such as
nano ZnO and B is important especially their mechanism of absorption and mode of action that
influences several physiological processes such as photosynthesis, which ultimately affects crop

yield and quality.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

Nanotechnology in Agricultural Research

Nanotechnology is the study of manipulating matter on an atomic and molecular scale.
Generally, nanoparticles are defined as particulate dispersions or solid particles with a size in
the range of 10-1000 nm (Mohanraj & Chen, 2006). Nanotechnology involves developing
materials or devices within that size range. At the nanoscale, the matter presents altered
properties which are novel and very different from those observed at macroscopic level, often
displaying improved properties at a very dramatic degree. For instance, nanoparticles exhibit
extremely high surface area to volume ratios and outstanding barrier properties when good
dispersion is achieved, as compared to the same particles when in macroscale. The change in
properties is due to the reduced molecular size and also because of changed interactions between
molecules (Lagashetty & Venkataraman, 2005).

Nano-scaling, in theory, should make fertilizer nutrients more available to nanoscale
plant pores and therefore result in efficient nutrient use (Suppan, 2013). In order to produce
nano-scale particle size, often a high-speed homogenization or ultrasonication may be employed
(Zambaux et al. 1998). The major goals in designing nanoparticles as a fertilizer delivery
system are to control particle size, surface properties and release of nutrients in order to achieve
the optimal rate and dose regimen (Mohanraj & Chen, 2006).

Despite of several advantages of using nanoparticles, nanoparticles do have limitations.
For example, their small size and large surface area can lead to particle-particle aggregation,

making physical handling of nanoparticles difficult in liquid and dry forms (Mohanraj & Chen,

2006). This can be resolved by using cationic surfactants, such as cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide, or CTAB (Li, 2003).

The zeta potential of a nanoparticle is commonly used to characterize the surface charge
property of nanoparticles. It reflects the electrical potential of particles and is influenced by the
composition of the particle and the medium in which it is dispersed. Nanoparticles with a zeta
potential above (+/-) 30 mV have been shown to be stable in suspension, as the surface charge
prevents aggregation of the particles (Covreur et al., 2002).

A study by Behnassi et al. (2011) observed that the size reduction in adsorbent (natural
zeolite) from micro to nano-dimension coincided with an increase in N content by 33.3%. The
phenomenal increase was attributed to the extensive surface area exhibited by nano-based

formulations that facilitates adsorption processes.

Nano Zinc Oxide
Zinc Oxide (ZnO) in its simplest form shows tetrahedron geometry in which each ion is
enclosed by four counter ions pointing towards corners of a tetrahedron. Its physical and
chemical properties are summarized in Table 1. Zinc oxide exists in two common crystalline
forms: wurtzite (Figure 2a) and zincblende (Figure 2b). The wurtzite structure is more stable
under ambient conditions. In a ZnO nanoparticle, the Zn atom has an atomic number 30 and
belongs to the d-block, whereas the O atom has an atomic number 8, belonging to the p-block

in the periodic table.

The synthesis of ZnO nanostructures can be accomplished by physical and chemical
routes. However, chemical methods are more suitable for the production of ZnO on an
industrial scale due to low cost and efficiency in obtaining nanostructures with uniform size and
morphology. Among the chemical methods, the solochemical technique stands out for its

simplicity, quickness and low cost in the production of ZnO nanocrystals with high quality.

10

Moreover, this method uses milder reaction conditions than those employed by most chemical
methods proposed in the literature. The method involves a reaction between a heated alkaline
solution, such as NaOH solution, and another containing the precursor, such as ZnCl solution,
at room temperature. Therefore, a decomposition reaction of the reactants is initiated causing
the immediate formation of ZnO nanocrystals (Vaezi & Sadrnezhaad, 2007).

In chemical synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, capping agents and stabilizers are
extensively used in order to control the size and to avoid agglomeration (UI hag et al., 2017).
In this study, CTAB was used as a stabilizer, or a surfactant for the synthesis of the ZnO
nanoparticles.

ZnO is described as a functional, strategic, promising and versatile inorganic material
with a broad range of applications. Zinc oxide nanoparticles typically have neutral hydroxyl
groups attached to their surface, which plays a key role in their surface charge behavior (Qu &
Morais, 2001). In aqueous medium and at high pH, the chemisorbed protons (H*) move out
from the particle surface leaving a negatively charged surface with partially bonded oxygen
atoms (ZnO°). At lower pH, protons from the environment are likely transferred to the particle
surface, leading to a positive charge from surface ZnOH2* groups. The isoelectric point of 9-
10 (Degen & Kosec, 2000) indicates that ZnO nanoparticles will have a strong positive surface

charge under physiological conditions.

Soil Micronutrients

A fertilizer is technically defined as any material of natural or synthetic origin (other
than liming materials) that is applied to soils or to plant tissues (usually leaves) to supply one

or more plant nutrients essential to the growth of plants. Fertilizers contain beneficial nutrients

11

including macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients include nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium which are added to soil in quantities from 0.2% to 4.0% (on a dry matter weight
basis) and are more essential than micronutrients. Micronutrients, on the other hand, are
elements that are applied to soil in much smaller amounts, ranging from 5 to 200 ppm, or less
than 0.02% dry weight (Das, 2014). These elements could be sulfur (S), boron (B), copper (Cu),

iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), or zinc (Zn).
Zinc role in plants

Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient for humans, animals and plants. It is the second
most abundant transition metal in organisms, next only to iron (Fe), and the only metal
represented in all six enzyme classes (oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases,
isomerases and ligases) (Auld, 2001). Zinc is generally taken up by higher plants as a divalent
cation, Zn?*, which acts either as the metal component of enzymes or as a functional structural
or a regulatory co-factor of many enzymes (Prasad et al., 2012).

A number of published researches have reported the essentiality and role of zinc for
plant growth and yield (Marschner, 1993; Brown et al., 1993; Fageria et al., 2002). Early reports
of severe Zn deficiency symptoms included impaired stem elongation in tomato (Skoog, 1940),
and reduced protein and starch synthesis while sugar content was unaffected (Marschner, 1995).

Zinc plays a crucial role in the germination, pollen function, biomass production, and
chlorophyll synthesis in plants (Kaya and Higgs, 2002). Zn is also known to reduce the negative
effects of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in environmental stresses and its deficiency
decreases plant resistance (Cakmak and Marschner, 1988).

Zn acts as co-factor for some of the important antioxidant enzymes like super oxide

dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase whose activity depends on the co-factor supply of Zn nutrient

12

(Misra and Srivastava, 2010). In a study by Cherif et al. (2011) on Zn-treated tomato, the
superoxide dismutase, CAT and ascorbate peroxidases activities were found to increase
significantly. Elmer and White (2016) have also reported the pesticidal properties of ZnO. It
was noted that foliar application of ZnO on tomato and eggplant reduced disease by 28%.

Zn is also essential in the synthesis for tryptophan, a precursor of indole acetic acid
(IAA). Physiological disorders such as "little leaf disease" in fruit trees are attributable to Zn
and IAA deficiencies. Zn deficiency symptoms are easily identified by mottled leaves, highly
reduced leaf size, and often dieback of twigs and small misshapen fruit (Spiegel-Roy and
Goldschmidt, 2008).

Carbonic anhydrase is a Zn-containing enzyme involved in photosynthesis. In a study
by Qiao et al. (2014), foliar application of Zn enhanced carbonic anhydrase activity in rice

leaves and hence, increased photosynthesis.

Zinc chemistry in soils

The average concentration of Zn in the lithosphere is 80 mg kg “! (Lindsay, 1979). The
chemical composition of the parent material primarily dictates the concentration of Zn in natural
(unfertilized and uncontaminated) soil. Total Zn concentrations in uncontaminated soils vary
widely and can range from 10 to 100 mg kg “! (Mertens and Smolders, 2013).

Soil solution Zn represents a small proportion of total Zn in the soil, but it is of critical
importance as it is from this pool that plants absorb Zn. The concentration of Zn in soil solution
is normally low, and can range from 4 x 10°'° to 4 x 10° M (Barber, 1995). Zinc concentration
in soil solution is negatively correlated to soil pH, which can be explained by the stronger

sorption on the solid phase at high pH values (Jeffery and Uren, 1983).

13

In addition to the total concentration, the speciation of Zn in solution may affect its
bioavailability. In the soil solution, Zn occurs in the form of free hydrated [Zn(6H20)**] and
complexed species. Solution Zn speciation depends on pH as well as the abundance of ligands
and competing ions in solution (Degryse et al., 2009). At high pH values (pH above 7.7), the
free hydrated Zn ion can hydrolyze and form “hydroxy-complexes,” that is, ZnOH* and
Zn(OH) (Lindsay, 1979).

Zinc in soil solution can form soluble complexes with inorganic (eg, sulfate, phosphate,
nitrate, chloride) and organic (eg, fulvic and humic acids) ligands. Zinc complexes with
inorganic ligands are usually of lesser importance. Complexation with dissolved organic matter
(OM) (humic, fulvic acids) increases with increasing pH (Weng et al., 2002).

Soil pH is the most important soil property determining the adsorption of Zn in soils,
which can be attributed to the increasing negative charge on the soil surface as pH increases.
The term adsorption refers to the transfer of Zn from the solution to the solid phase and includes

precipitation (McBride et al., 1997).
Boron role in plants

The adequate supply of boron (B) in plants is essential for the germination of pollen
grains, the elongation of pollen tube, fruit set and yield. It is also indirectly involved in the
activation of dehydrogenase enzymes, sugar translocation, uptake of calcium, nucleic acids and
plant hormones (Bose and Tripathi,1996; as cited by Davarpanah et al., 2016).

As with other nutrients, B has a pronounced effect on the production and quality of
tomato. Boron also plays an important role in flowering and fruit formation (Nonnecke, 1989).

Boron deficiency affects the growing points of roots and youngest leaves. The leaves become

14

wrinkled and curled with light green color. Its deficiency affects translocation of sugar,
starches, nitrogen and phosphorus, synthesis of amino acids and proteins (Stanley et al., 1995).
In B-deficient plants the youngest leaves become pale green, losing more color at the base then
at the tip. Boron deficiency symptoms will often appear in the form of thickened wilted, or
curled leaves, a thickened, cracked, or water soaked condition of petioles and stems, and
discoloration, cracking or rotting of fruit, tubers or roots. (Tisdale et al., 1985).

The requirement of plant for B is higher during the reproductive growth or seed
production stage than it is in the vegetative stage. As a result of the general immobility of B,
which is a characteristic of most plant species, and the higher B requirements during
reproductive stages of growth, plant require a continuous supply of B from soil or foliar for
their entire growth cycle (Mozafar, 1993). Naz et al (2012) observed that 2 kg B ha’! resulted
in maximum number of flower clusters per plant, fruit set percentage, total yield, fruit weight
loss and total soluble solid in Rio Grand cultivar of tomato. This treatment showed significant
effect on all parameters. It was found that 2 kg B ha” significantly affected flowering and

fruiting of Rio Grand cultivar.

Boron chemistry in soils

The amount of boron in soils ranges from 2 to 100 mg/kg with an average of 30 mg/kg.
High-boron-content soils (10-100 mg B/kg) are usually associated with volcanic activity. Most
soils, however, have a low boron content (<10 mg B/kg). Boron does not exist in in its free
form in nature, but it invariably occurs as the oxide B2O3 in combination with the oxides of
other elements to form borates of greater or lesser complexity. The first discovered borate

mineral is sodium tetraborate decahydrate Na2B407:10H2O or borax. Boron is an essential

15

micronutrient for plants and consequently is included in many fertilizers at levels ranging from
0.01 to 0.06 wt.%, most commonly in the form of borax (Kochkodan et al., 201 5).

In nature, boron is released from rocks and soils through weathering, and subsequently
ends up in the aqueous environment as boric acid B(OH); or borate ion B(OH) 4. Boric acid
can be prepared from borax by the action of hydrochloric acid, via the following reaction:

Na,B,07+10H,0 + 2HCl > 4H3B03+ NaCl+5H,0 £q.1

It crystallizes from aqueous solutions normally as white, shining, waxy plates of orthoboric
acid, H3BO3. On heating above 100°C, the orthoboric acid gradually loses water, and changes
to metaboric acid HBO2:

H3B03 > H3B0,+ H,0  Eq.2
At higher temperatures, all the water is lost, and anhydrous boric oxide is formed:

2H3B03 > B,03+ 3H,0 Eq.3
Crystalline boric acid consists of layers of H3BO3 molecules held together by hydrogen bonds
(Figure 2). The solubility of boric acid in water increases rapidly with temperature at
atmospheric pressure (Table 2). Boric acid dissolved in water is uncharged and has a trigonal

structure.

Boron occurs in aqueous solutions as boric acid, B(OH)3 and borate ions, B(OH)"
(Evans and Sparks, 1983). Boric acid is a very weak, monobasic acid that acts as a Lewis acid

by accepting a hydroxyl ion (OHY to form the B(OH)s (Goldberg, 1993).

H3B03 + H,0 > B(OH), + H2,0 Eq.4

The equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis reaction of boric acid is 5.75 x 107° or pKa
= 9.24 at 25° C (Basset, 1980). Thus, below pH 9.24, the uncharged species is predominant,
while above 9.24, the borate anion is predominant. Kochkodan et al., (2015) also reported that
boric acid dissociates into borate ions at pH 8.5 and above, peaking at pH 10.5. At pH > 10,
B(OH), is the main form of Boron that is present in solution. Boric acid, the uncharged
molecule, is the main chemical form of B taken up by plants (Marschner, 1986).

The storehouse for most of the boron in soils is soil organic matter. Asa result, most of
the available boron is in the plow layer, where OM is highest. Soils low in OM are deficient in
boron more often than soils with high OM content. When the surface soil dries out, plants are
unable to feed in the zone where most of the available boron is present. This can lead to boron
deficiency. When rain or irrigation moistens the soil, the plants can again feed from the surface
soil and the boron deficiency often disappears.

Somewhat like nitrates, boron is not readily held by the soil particles and moves down
through coarse-textured soils, often leaching below the root zones of many plants. Because less
leaching occurs on fine-textured silts and clays, these soils are not boron deficient as often as
sands. Soils with a pH of 7.0 or above are more apt to be deficient in boron than are acid soils.

This is one reason for not applying lime when the pH of the soil is above 6.8.

17

Sah and Brown (1997) investigated the different techniques for boron determination in
plant and soil samples. Boron present in soils is commonly divided into three categories: (1)
total B, (2) acid-soluble B and (3) water-soluble B. Total B content of a soil is not a reliable
indicator of available B or the need for B. The acid-soluble B content of a soil is a better
indicator but is not a reliable index of plant available B, especially in calcareous soils that
neutralize the acidity of extractant. Berger and Truog (1940) proposed a hot water extraction
(HWE) for 5 min (with refluxing) as an index of available B in the soil. The HWE method has
been widely used and B extracted by this method often correlates well with plant B uptake
(Shuman et al., 1992). The HWE method however is time consuming, tedious for routine and
reproducible usage. Several convenient alternative methods to estimate the amount of plant
available B in soils have been cited by Sah and Brown (1997). These include (1) microwave
heating of the soil sample and the extractant in sealed plastic pouches, (2) extraction with water
or 2mM DTPA at room temperature, (3) extraction with water or a solution of BaCl2 and
microwave heating (4) extraction with hot 0.01 M CaCl or extraction with 1.0 N NH4OAC (pH

7.0) (Sakal et al., 1993).

Zinc and Boron deficiency in Philippine soils

Zinc deficient areas in the Philippines are those land planted with rice usually submerged
into water or frequently flooded. Five different rice-growing regions in Luzon were identified
by BSWM as zinc deficient soils: Alaminos, Pangasinan (Region I), Jaen, Nueva Ecija (Region
III), Naujan, Mindoro (Region IV-B), Banga and New Washington, Aklan (Region VI) and
Victoria, Laguna (Region IV-A) (BSWM, 2016). A study by Yoshida et al., 1973 also

concluded that soils in San Juan, Batangas and San Pablo, Laguna are Zinc-deficient, and

18

responsive to Zn fertilization. Sariaya sandy loam in Sariaya, Quezon province, has also been
previously documented to be deficient in Zinc. Table 3 summarizes the soil and environmental
conditions leading to Zn and B deficiency. Zinc-deficient soils have typically neutral to alkaline
pH, high CaCO; content, high OM content (peat soils), high oxide content, high P phosphorus,

sandy texture, or have been subjected to prolonged waterlogging (Alloway, 2009).

Soil practices aaa anor noe Liming

Zinc deficiency is also associated with a high bicarbonate content, a Mg to Ca ratio in
soils which is greater than 1, and high levels of available phosphate and silica. The critical
deficiency limit in Philippine soils is 1.0 mg kg™! Zn by extraction with 0.05M HCI and 0.5-
1.15 ppm mg kg" Zn by extraction with DTPA. Zinc extracted from the soil solution of deficient
paddy fields is generally in the range of 0.05 - 0.25 mg L"! (BSWM, 2016).

Boron in soils typically has a concentration between 2 to 100 mg kg" with an average

of 30 mg kg". Boron, like Zinc, becomes less available to plants as soil pH increases.

19

Therefore, the practice of applying lime to improve the uptake of other important nutrients can
cause B deficiency (Bunt, 1956 and Fleming, 1980 as cited by Davis et al., 2003). Adams
(1978) also observed that B deficiency can occur readily in tomatoes grown in areas with acid

sandy soils and heavy rainfall, because such conditions result to leaching.

Sources of Zn and B fertilizer

The common sources of Zinc and B fertilizers are summarized in Tables 4 and 5. The
application of 20 to 50 kg ha’! of zinc sulfate to the soil is the most common way of correcting
zinc deficiency among farmers. Likewise, treating seeds with zinc materials before sowing in
nursery beds or direct seeded field is the common practice among farmers. Borax and boric acid
are the two most common sources of Boron fertilizers for farmers. In this study, the sources of
Zn foliar are ZnSO« and nano ZnO (synthesized and commercial), and bulk ZnO, whereas for

Boron source, Boric acid will be used as foliar spray.

Zinc and Boron critical levels and deficiency symptoms in tomato

In tomato, boron and zinc are the micronutrients that play an important role in improving
the yield and fruit quality, in addition to checking various diseases and physiological disorders
(Magalhaes et al., 1980). In Philippine soils, Zinc concentration is considered as low when the
value is between the range of 0.5 — 1.15 ppm (via DTPA extraction), and very low when the
concentration is below 0.5 ppm (Pantastico, 1973 as cited in Phil. Bureau of Soils and Water
Management Handbook). Below these Zn concentrations, tomato is expected to manifest
deficiency symptoms. On the other hand, B deficiency occurs when the level in the tomato
tissue falls below 19 mg kg” Gallagher (1972). The deficiency can be reduced by spraying
borax solution in the foliage at 0.5 mg L"! or applying borax in the soil at 22 kg ha’.

Severe Zn deficiency is characterized by root apex necrosis (‘dieback’), whilst sub-
lethal Zn deficiency induces spatially heterogeneous or interveinal chlorosis (‘mottle leaf’), the
development of reddish-brown or bronze tints (‘bronzing’), and a range of auxin deficiency-
like responses such as internode shortening (‘rosetting’), epinasty, inward curling of leaf lamina
(‘goblet’ leaves) and reductions in leaf size (‘little leaf”). In most crops, the typical leaf Zn
concentration required for adequate growth is 15—20 mg Zn kg”! dry weight (Marschner, 1995).

In Boron-deficient tomato, the petioles are brittle and break off suddenly, which results

to lower yield. Fruits are not marketable because of their chapped surface. Roots are short and

21

with thickened necrotic tips. With severe B deficiency, the growing points of main shoot and
laterals die and the crop is lost. The younger leaves remain small, are curled inwards and
deformed. They show chlorotic spots between the veins which are yellow to orange and the

veins themselves can become yellow or purple. The older leaves appear yellowish green.

Foliar Application of nano ZnO and B

The most important application of nanotechnology in agricultural crop production is the
field of nano-fertilizers, which can feed plants gradually in a controlled manner, conversely to
what occurs in the case of common fertilizers. Nano-materials can be used for designing new
Zn fertilizers, with the solubility, diffusion and availability of Zn to plants being affected by the
nano-particulate Zn characteristics (size, specific surface area and reactivity) (Davarpanah et
al., 2016).

Foliar application of Zn has been used as an agronomic practice to supplement soil Zn
fertilizer applications during plant growth stages of high Zn demand, particularly when soil and
climatic conditions may limit the availability of soil-applied Zn (Fernandez and Brown, 2013).
Foliar Zn application is considered more effective than soil Zn applications to alleviate Zn
deficiency symptoms when they appear during the crop cycle. However, the disadvantage of
foliar Zn is that multiple applications may be required to correct Zn deficiency due to the limited
mobility of foliar-absorbed Zn to non-sprayed new leaves and roots (Swietlik, 2002). Also a
yield penalty may be incurred by the time the symptoms of Zn deficiency are diagnosed and a
foliar spray program initiated. Brennan (1991) showed that in a Zn-deficient soil banding ZnSO4
at sowing resulted in higher wheat grain yield compared to a foliar Zn spray. The limited re-

translocation of foliar-applied Zn to other organs of the plant is related to poor penetration of

22

the nutrient into the leaf or to the high binding capacity of Zn to leaf tissues, rather than limited
phloem mobility (Fernandez et al., 2013).

A study by Davarpanah et al (2016) was carried out to assess the effects of the foliar
application of nano-fertilizers of zinc (Zn) and boron (B) on pomegranate fruit yield and quality.
The effect was not as large with Zn as with B. Fertilization with the highest of the two doses
led to significant improvements in fruit quality, including 4.4-7.6% increases in TSS, 9.5—
29.1% decreases in TA, 20.6-46.1% increases in maturity index and 0.28-0.62 pH unit
increases in juice pH, whereas physical fruit characteristics were unaffected. Changes in total
sugars and total phenolic compounds were only minor, whereas the antioxidant activity and
total anthocyanins were unaffected. The study by Panwar et al, (2012) revealed that tomato
plant exposed to a concentration of 20 mg L"! ZnO nanoparticles exhibited maximum growth
and biomass production. ICP-OES analysis showed significant concentration of Zn in the
digested plant material confirming the penetration of Zn NPs in tomato plants. SEM
assessments of tomato leaves revealed stomata as the preferred site for the penetration of ZnO
NPs.

In a recent study, Du et al. (2015) used X-ray fluorescence microscopy for in situ
examination of the absorption and relocation of foliar-applied Zn to either the adaxial or abaxial
surface of leaves from Zn-sufficient and Zn-deficient tomato and citrus plants. Results from this
study showed that the concentration of Zn in the underlying tissue increased by up to 600-fold
in tomato but only up to 5-fold in citrus.

The most common Zn sources used for foliar fertilization are soluble salts and chelates.
Surfactants and adjuvants are also included in the formulation to aid on penetration of the

nutrient through the cuticle Crowley et al. (1996).

23

Factors affecting foliar fertilization

The major factors that affect the absorption and translocation of foliar-applied nutrients
are the timing of application, the physicochemical properties of the formulation, the
environmental conditions during application, and the particular characteristics of the plants
(Fernandez and Brown, 2013). The other factors affecting the efficiency of foliar fertilization

are presented in the following table.

Effect of pre-harvest factors on chemical properties of tomato

Tomato is defined as a vegetable, but botanically is a fruit. It is among the most
popularly consumed fruits in the world and as such could be considered as an important source

of ascorbic acid and dietary antioxidants.

24

Figure 3. Tomato fruits of “Marimax” variety (Source: www.eastwestseed.com/philippines)

Lycopene, phenolics, flavonoids and vitamins C and E are mainly responsible for the
antioxidant activity of raw tomatoes and processed tomato products (Lenucci et al., 2006).
Lycopene is the most abundant carotenoid present in red tomatoes, comprising up to 90% of the
total carotenoids present. The taste, color, and nutrient qualities of tomatoes can depend on
their antioxidant contents (Dumas et al., 2003). However, there is limited information on the
effect of different forms of fertilizers on the antioxidant components of tomatoes. The data
available on the effect of fertilizers on the production of phenolic substances and other
antioxidant components of tomato are either rare or not very reliable or applicable.

Tomatoes are grown by using both conventional as well as organic fertilizers. They are
considered as heavy consumers because of their rapid growth and long production season.
Production of one ton of tomato fruit removes 1.4 - 3.6 kg nitrogen, 0.2 - 1.4 kg phosphorous,
and 2.2 - 5.4 kg potassium from the soil (Sandoval-Villa et al., 1999).

Nitrogen (N) is one of the major macronutrients in improving the yield of tomato (Zhu

etal., 2012). High N levels in greenhouse plantation will produce a high yield of tomato (Zhang

25

et al., 2005). However, excessive N fertilizer is a common occurrence in conventional tomato
cultivation and this practice degrades soil and water quality by increasing NO3-N concentration
in topsoil and groundwater (Sainju et al., 2001).

Nitrogen fertilizers at high rates tend to decrease the vitamin C content in many fruits
and vegetables. Vitamin C content of many crops can be increased with less frequent irrigation.
Temperature management after harvest is the most important factor to maintain vitamin C of
fruits and vegetables; losses are accelerated at higher temperatures and with longer storage

durations (Lee & Kader, 2000).

Effect of B and Zn on Tomato Postharvest Quality

A study by Salam et al., (2011) showed that tomato fruits which were produced with 2.5
kg B + 6 kg Zn tons ha’! gave the highest fruit pulp weight among all treatments. In contrast,
it was the lowest (76.7% lower than best treatment) in treatments without boron, and zinc. This
can be accounted to the higher accumulation of assimilates to the fruits with higher Zn
treatment. Dry matter content of the tomato fruits also increased progressively with increased
doses of boron and zinc. The fruits produced with 2.5 kg B + 6 kg Zn ha’! gave the highest TSS
content (4.60%), but the lowest TSS content (3.80%) was found in without boron and zinc. The
effect of Zn on total sugars can be due to its role in the starch and nucleic acid metabolism, and
also to the activities of various enzymes involved in these biochemical reactions (Alloway,
2009). The fruits produced with that same treatment also gave the highest (11.20 mg 100g!)
ascorbic acid. On the contrary, the lowest value was recorded in without application of boron

and zinc.

26

In terms of chlorophyll content, the fruits which were produced without boron and zine
had less chlorophyll-a content. Singh and Singh (2004) reported that zinc application not only
increased chlorophyll content, but also raised the concentration of Zn, Ca, Mg, K, and P in
tissues.

At 30 days after storage, percent marketable fruit was gradually increased with the
increased quantity of boron and zinc. This could be attributed to the reduction in microbial
activities as a consequence of balanced boron, zinc, and cowdung. Kocevski et al. (1997) stated
that boron influenced the defenses against plant diseases. Shelf life was also gradually increased

with the increased doses of boron and zinc.

Biochemical changes during tomato fruit ripening

During ripening of tomatoes, several important changes occur in their chemical
structure, such as synthesis of pigments (e.g. lycopene), production of flavor and aroma
compounds, and increase in the ratio of citric to malic acid (Toor & Savage, 2006). There are
also studies that reported an increase in ascorbic acid content of tomatoes during their ripening
(Abushita et al., 1997). Total phenolics and flavonoids have also been reported to increase
during the ripening of tomatoes (Cano et al., 2003). Lycopene, which is responsible for the red
color of tomatoes, is regarded as an antioxidant with high biological activity in the body
(Javanmardi & Kubota, 2006). Lycopene content varies considerably between cultivars, stage
of maturity and growing conditions (Dumas et al., 2003). The metabolism of tomatoes
continues, even after their detachment from the plant, when fruits have reached their red stage.
They continue to ripen and finally deteriorate to a point where they become non-marketable

(Toor & Savage, 2006).

27

Cultural Management Practices of Tomato

Growth stages of tomato. Tomato completes a life cycle, from seed to seed, in one
season (Figure 4). The general growth stages for tomato are: seed, seedling stage, vegetative
stage, flowering stage, fruiting stage, and harvesting stage. The seedling stage is usually the
period from emerging seed to transplanting to the main field. Vegetative stage is the period
from transplanting until the first flower buds develop. Flowering stage is when the plant with
flower buds and open flowers. The fruiting stage is the period when plant yields mature fruits.
Finally, the maturity stage or the harvesting stage is the period when plant yields mature fruits

(FAO, 2000).

These growth stages are overlapping in time: harvesting stage
fruiting stage 55+DAT
flowering stage | 45+DAT

seedling stage vegetative stage 24-45 DAT

Tomato Varieties. Presented in Table 7 are the different varieties of tomato in the
Philippines. For this study, the variety used was “Marimax”, which is a product of East-West
Seed company. The horticultural characteristics of Marimax tomato is summarized in Table 7.
This variety has a relatively shorter postharvest life (32-33 days) as compared to other hybrid

varieties (Table 8).

Climate and soil requirements of tomato. Tomato is a day neutral plant. Its fruits

contain higher ascorbic acid with high light intensity. It also needs different temperatures for

each growth development stage (Table 9). High day temperatures (>40°C) can abort the flowers

due to physical destruction of pollen grains. Tomato thrives on many soil types. It grows best

29

in fairly fertile, well-drained sandy loam soil or heavier soils and soil free from root-knot
nematodes and bacterial wilt organisms. The soil organic matter must be at least 1.5%, with a
pH of 4.3 — 8.7 (growth is optimum at pH 5.5 — 6.5). Tomato is moderately tolerant to acidity

(Rasco, 2014).

This study primarily aimed to investigate the efficacy of ZnO nanoparticles in
combination with Boron, on the growth, yield, and fruit quality of tomato. One of the major
objectives of this study is to determine the effect of nano ZnO and Boron foliar fertilizers on
the major carpometric characteristics, antioxidant components and antioxidant activity of the

greenhouse-grown tomatoes.

CHAPTER 3

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Time and Place of Study

The synthesis of the nano Zinc and Boron fertilizers was conducted at the Soil Chemistry
laboratory, Division of Soil Science, Agricultural Systems Institute - College of Agriculture and
Food Science (ASI-CAFS), University of the Philippines Los Bafios. The pot experiment for
testing of the nanofertilizers on tomato was done in the experimental screen house in ASI-
CAFS, UPLB. The third and final part, which involved the postharvest quality of the harvested
tomatoes, was conducted at Postharvest Horticulture Training and Research Center (PHTRC),
Institute of Crop Science, College of Agriculture and Food Science, University of the

Philippines Los Bafios. The duration of the entire study is from June 2017 to March 2018.

Activity 1. Synthesis and characterization of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles
The first part of this thesis study focused on the synthesis and characterization of the
Zinc oxide nanoparticles that will be used in combination with Boron as foliar fertilizers for the

tomato pot experiment.

Activity 1.1. Optimization of Starting Material for Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles

Two different synthesis methods were compared in the preparation of ZnO
nanoparticles. The objective of this activity was to determine the most suitable starting material
for the ZnO nanoparticles. The products formed from both methods were characterized in terms

of yield and chemical purity. The synthesis method that produced nano ZnO with the desired

31

characteristics was used for the production of the final nano ZnO that was used for the actual

pot experiment.

Method 1: Direct Precipitation Method using Zinc sulfate heptahydrate and
Ammonium Hydroxide as precursors. The method used by Sadraei (2016) for synthesis of
nano ZnO nanoparticles was adapted for the first method. Zinc sulfate heptahydrate
(ZnSO4(H20)7) and Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), both technical grade, were used as the
starting materials for this method. Zinc sulfate heptahydrate (2.9386 g) was dissolved in 100
mL deionized water. A mother solution was then prepared from 25 mL of the Zinc sulfate
solution (0.2 M) and 50 mL of purified water. The alkali solution, ammonium hydroxide, 25
mL (NH,OH, 25%) with an approximate rate of 5 mL per minute was added dropwise into the
mother solution. The magnetic stirrer/heater for vigorous stirring was used at the temperature
of about 50-60°C. The precipitates derived from the reaction between the Zinc sulfate and
Ammonium hydroxide solution were collected by filtering, and then rinsed three times with
distilled water by centrifugation. The final ZnO precipitates were then collected after drying at

60, 100, 200, and 300 °C (for optimization) in a laboratory drying oven for 8 hours.

Method 2: Synthesis of nano ZnO using ZnCl: and NaOH as precursor. For the
second synthesis method of ZnO nanoparticles for this study, the precipitation technique used
by Awodugba & Ilyas (2013) was adapted, with some modifications. Zinc oxide nanoparticles
were synthesized using Zinc Chloride (ZnCl2) and Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), both technical
grade, as precursors. The concentration ratio between the ZnCl2 and NaOH was determined

using the chemical equation formula shown below:

ZnCl, + 2NaOH > Zn(OH), + 2NaCl

32

Initially, 0.4 M aqueous methanol solution of ZnCl2 was kept under constant stirring
using magnetic stirrer to completely dissolve the zinc chloride and 0.8M aqueous methanol
solution of NaOH was also prepared in the same way and kept under stirring. The speed of
stirring of the ZnCl: was increased after its complete dissolution, and 0.8M aqueous solution of
NaOH was added dropwise for 20 minutes. The cationic surfactant, Cetyltrimethyl ammonium
bromide (CTAB), 0.5 g, was added into the resulting solution. Surfactants have the ability to
control the morphology and size distribution of nanoparticles.

The white-colored solution obtained after complete addition of addition of NaOH and
CTAB was constantly stirred in a magnetic stirrer for 2 hrs, and later sealed and kept overnight.
At high pH values (pH above 7.7), the free hydrated Zn ion can hydrolyze and form “hydroxy-
complexes,” that is, ZnOH* and Zn(OH)2 (Lindsay, 1979). The pH of the solution was varied
in order to determine the optimum pH that yielded the nano Zinc oxide with the desired
characteristics.

Zinc hydroxide with some impurities such as NaCl settled at the bottom and the excess
mother liquor obtained on top was discarded. The residue was washed five times with deionized
water and methanol or ethanol to remove the by-products such as NaCl which are bound with
the Zinc hydroxide, and then dried in air atmosphere at 60, 100, 200, and 300 °C (for
optimization).

Synthesis products from both methods were subjected to Scanning Electron Microscopy
for particle structure elucidation and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy analysis for

elemental analysis.

33

Activity 1.2. Optimization of synthesis parameters for nano ZnO

The starting material that was selected based on the result from the initial optimization
experiment was then used to optimize the synthesis parameters, particularly the pH of the
solution, mixing time, and calcination temperature and duration.

The synthesized ZnO was compared to commercial nano ZnO (technical grade Sigma
Aldrich) in terms of the following characterization methods:

Mineralogical Analysis by Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Mineralogical analysis of the
nano ZnO samples was performed by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy to determine
the average mineral composition.

Particle Size Determination. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis was
performed on the submitted samples to characterize the surface structure and measure average
particle size in powder form.

Molecular structure by Infrared Spectroscopy. The identification of the atomic
arrangement and the concentrations of the chemical bonds present in the samples was carried
out using Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), in which percentage transmission
and wave number are the output. In the spectrogram for ZnO nanoparticles, there is a
characteristic sharp peak at around 400-470 cm"! which can be attributed to Zn-O stretching
vibrations, but depending on synthesis and other experimental conditions, weak bands
positioned at 520 cm’!, 566 cm’! and 665 cm! are also possible to appear in the FT-IR spectrum
(Hernandez et al., 2007).

Elemental Characterization. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was performed
to determine elemental composition (%Zn, %O) in the synthesized samples, and measure zeta

potential, which is related to the degree of agglomeration of the nanoparticles.

34

Activity 2. Application of nano-ZnO and B foliar fertilizer for pot-grown tomato

The second major activity of the thesis study was the formulation of the foliar fertilizers
containing nano ZnO and B, and testing their performance on greenhouse-grown tomato. The

effect of the foliar treatments on growth and yield parameters of tomato was evaluated.

Treatments and Experimental Design

The treatments for this study consisted of four sources of zinc and one source of boron
as foliar fertilizers. There were nine (9) treatment combinations, laid out in a Randomized
Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three (3) replications and four (4) pots per replication

(Table 10). Tomato (var. ‘Marimax’) was used as the test crop.

The foliar fertilizers were applied during three critical growth stages of the tomato: (i)
before flower initiation; (ii) after fruit set when it becomes approximately marble sized; and (iii)
at 20 days interval of second spray (Sultana et al., 2016). In addition to the levels of boron and
zinc under investigation, NPK and organic fertilizers were applied to the soil uniformly, based

on recommended rates, for all the pots.

Preparation of foliar solutions containing Zn and B

Zinc oxide has an inherent low solubility in water, thus a heterogeneous suspension is
formed when it is added to water. If the suspension is to be used as a foliar spray, the solids
should be dissolved thoroughly, or dispersed evenly in the solution. Prior to spraying, the
suspensions were subjected to ultra-sonication (15-30 minutes) in order to disperse the particles
uniformly in the solution. The foliar solution for the commercial zinc oxide nanopowder (80%
Zn, Sigma-Aldrich™), were prepared in the same manner. The other source of zinc is technical
grade zinc sulfate (ZnSOq .7H20) containing 23% Zn. The foliar solutions of ZnSO4 were
prepared by manual stirring. Zinc sulfate is soluble in water, thus no sonication is required.

The foliar spray for B were prepared using technical grade boric acid (H3BO3), which
contains 17.5% B. Boric acid has a water solubility of 5.44% at 25°C, thus a homogenous
solution was obtained in preparing the foliar solutions for boric acid. At a pH of 9.24, the
uncharged species of boric acid is predominant, while above 9.24, the borate anion is
predominant. Boric acid, the uncharged molecule, is the main chemical form of B taken up by
plants. Thus the pH of the foliar solutions were maintained at values below 9.24.

The total volume for each foliar spray was 50 mL, and was applied in such a way that it

will completely wet the tomato plant. All foliar solutions were added with Polysorbate-20 or

36

Tween-20, as wetting agent at the rate of 0.01 % for reducing contact angle between the liquid
and leaf surface (Sajid et al., 2010 as cited by Sultana et al., 2016). The surfactant will limit
water loss during the spray process, and ensure that the nutrients will adhere to the leaf surface,

thus maximizing uptake by foliage.

Tomato Variety. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. var. “Marimax”), purchased
from EastWest Seed Company, was used as the test crop, and grown in pots inside the
experimental screen house of Agricultural Systems Institute — University of the Philippines Los

Baijios.

Potting Soil. The potting soil used in the experimental pots was collected from Brgy
Canda, Sariaya, Quezon province on January 2018. The freshly collected soils were brought to
the Plant Pathology Division, Institute of Biological Sciences, UPLB, for sterilization in order
to minimize disease incidence, particularly bacterial wilt. The soils were heated over fire using
a halved drum, continuously for 3 days at 8 hours per day. The soils were subjected to physical

and chemical characterization prior to planting.

Experimental Lay-out. Randomization was done using Statistical Tool for Agricultural
Research (STAR) software according to a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with
three (3) replications and six (4) pots per replication (Figure 5). A total of 108 pots were used
in the study. Each experimental pot measured 10x10x13 inches, and contained eight (8)

kilograms of pre-weighed dry Sariaya sandy loam soil.

Initial Soil Characterization. Composite soil samples were collected and were
analyzed for physical and chemical properties. The pH of soil was determined in a ratio of 1:2.5
soil: distilled water suspension and 0.01 M CaCl solution using a glass electrode (Black, 1965).
Soil organic carbon was determined using the method by Walkley and Black (1934). Total N
was determined using Kjeldahl method, available P using Bray No. 2 method, exchangeable K
using flame photometer method, and soil CEC by leaching with ammonium acetate buffer
adjusted to pH 7.0 followed by steam distillation (Black, 1965). The soil texture was
determined using hydrometer method (Tan, 2005). Soil Zn levels were analyzed using AAS
while soil B levels were analyzed via Inductively Coupled Plasma — Optical Emission

Spectroscopy.

Cultural management practices for tomato:

a. Seed sowing. Tomato seeds (var. Marimax) purchased from East-West Corp were sown
directly into the prepared pots. Two seeds were sown directly into the pots, then the
seeds were covered lightly with soil after sowing. The seeds were hand watered. The
potting soils weree saturated with water for three days. After germination, watering
was. A week after sowing, the germinated seedlings were drenched with 1.0 tbsp of
dissolved complete fertilizer in 1.6 L of water. Drenching was done early in the morning
or late in the afternoon to avoid leaf burning(www/eastwestseed.com).. The distance

between pots was 0.75 meters.

b. Thinning. Seedlings growing almost in the same way were chosen for research and the

other seedlings were thinned out. Thinning was done 3-4 weeks after sowing. Each pot

39

contained one tomato seedling. Each treatment replicate had 6 pots. In all cases, plant

age was expressed in days after planting (DAP).

Fertilization. In addition to the levels of boron and zinc under investigation, NPK and
organic fertilizers were applied to the soil uniformly, based on recommended rates, for
all the pots. Among the three major nutrients (NPK), lesser potassium (K) is required
than nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in vegetable. However, K is usually applied to
tomatoes because of their high requirement. Based on the results of the soil analysis,
the recommended fertilizer rate (NPK) that was used for tomato is 200-220-300 (N-
P20s-K20) kg/ha. This rate was calculated using the assumption that the planting
distance is 0.5 x 0.75 meters. Therefore, it was assumed that an area of 0.4 sq m will be
occupied by each plant in a hill, and there is a total of 25,000 hills per hectare. The
following table summarizes the amount and type fertilizers that was applied uniformly

to each pot.

d.

Calcium Application. Tomatoes perform best when their soil has a pH level of 6.5 to 7.2.
Based on the soil analysis, the pH of the Sariaya sandy loam is at 5.92, which is acidic.
Lime was therefore added to the soil to increase the pH. Liquid lime was also added to
the soil as a drenching solution in order to have a more rapid effect, since agricultural

lime would have more time to incorporate into the soil.

40

e. Irrigation. Distilled water was used in irrigating all pots throughout the growing period
of the tomato. Newly transplanted seedlings were watered daily until they have
recovered (1-2 weeks). Tomato is most sensitive to water deficit during flowering,
somewhat sensitive immediately after transplanting and during fruit development and
least sensitive during vegetative growth. After seedling recovery, irrigation was done
only when the soil gets dry.

f. Staking/Trellising. Tomato plants were staked 3-4 weeks after transplanting. The
tomato plants were trellised with wooden stakes to keep the fruits and foliage off the
ground.

g. Pruning. Pruning, or the selective removal of side shoots, results to earlier maturity,
bigger size, uniformed fruits and ensures proper fruit color as it allows the sun to reach
the fruits. Pruning was done regularly, starting at an early stage because when done later
in the season, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the main stem and the suckers
(Hanson et al., 2001).

h. Pest and Diseases. Tomatoes are susceptible to diseases. Damping-off bacterial wilt,
bacterial spot, fusarium wilt, late blight, nematodes and a number of viral diseases are
some of the diseases that could infect tomatoes. High population of cutworm and
armyworm can also contribute to the loss in production, as well as the attack of whitefly
that carries viral diseases. The damage on the leaf of leafminer also affects the ability
of the plant to manufacture food, thus reducing the capacity to develop fruits (FAO,
2000). Tomato plants were given ample spacing to allow for proper air circulation,
which helps the foliage dry faster. Irrigation was done at the base of the tomato plant.

When blight or powdery mildew has infected leaves, these were immediately removed

41

and destroy them to help prevent the disease from spreading (Hanson et al., 2001; FAO,
2000).

i. Harvesting. Fruits were harvested at the mature green stage. Tomatoes harvested at
the mature green stage will ripen into a product indiscernible from vine-ripened fruit.
Yields reported were marketable fruit or total yield (marketable plus culls). Fruits were
culled for cracks, deformity, blossom end rot and other damage. All culled fruit were

weighed.
Growth parameters gathered

The growth parameters that were measured at a weekly interval were the following: plant
height (cm), number of leaves per plant, number of clusters per plant, number of buds per plant,
number of flowers per plant, number of fruits per cluster, and SPAD readings using a handheld

Chlorophyll meter.
Plant tissue analysis

At 54 DAP, one representative plant was randomly selected from each treatment replicate
and harvested for destructive analyses. After air drying for 24 hours, the roots, stem, and leaves
were separated and oven dried at 80°C for 72 hours. The above-ground biomass was determined
and the plant tissue samples were prepared for tissue analysis of total N (Kjeldahl method),
Total P (Vanadomolybdate method), Total K (Flame emission photometry), and Zn, B, Ca, Mg,
Mn, Cu, and Fe analyses via Inductively-Coupled Plasma — Optical Emission Spectroscopy
(ICP-OES). Laboratory samples were digested using a microwave digester. All tissue analyses
were performed in the Soils Chemistry Laboratory and Analytical Services Laboratory,

Division of Soil Science, Agricultural Systems Institute - College of Agriculture and Food

42

Science (ASI-CAFS), University of the Philippines Los Bafios. During harvest (74 DAP),

another set of plant tissue samples were subjected to the same methods of analyses.
Yield and yield components

Fruits were harvested during color break, or at Peel Color Index 2 (Green with a tinge of
orange). During harvest, the fruits were sorted in terms of quality (marketable and non-
marketable). The yield data that were gathered during and after harvest period were the
following: marketable yield (kg per plant, t ha‘'), non-marketable yield (kg/plant, t ha’), fruit

length and diameter (mm), and single fruit weight (g).

Activity 3. Evaluation of postharvest quality of harvested tomato as

influenced by nano ZnO foliar fertilizers

The newly harvested tomatoes were distributed according to the fertilizer treatments.
Their maturity were first checked in order to ensure uniformity. For all the postharvest analyses,
tomatoes with Peel Color Index 2 (definite break in color but not > 10%) (Table 15, Figure 6)
and Visual Quality Rating of 9-8 (excellent, field fresh), were selected for uniformity. The
tomatoes were then washed and then air dried prior to analysis. Each treatment type comprised
of three fruit replicates. All postharvest analyses were performed in the Postharvest
Horticulture Training and Research Center, Institute of Crop Science, University of the

Philippines Los Banos.

Data were collected on the following postharvest parameters:

a. Firmness. Fruit firmness was determined by puncture tests using a penetrometer.
Results were expressed in kg-force as the mean of two (2) random measurements taken

along the equatorial region of each tomato fruit.

b. Total Soluble Solids (TSS). 1n order to determine the TSS, thirty (30) g tomato fruit
flesh was homogenized in 30 mL distilled water and filtered using cotton. TSS,
expressed as “Brix, of the fruit extract (filtrate) was measured using a portable handheld

refractometer.

c. Juice pH. Using the filtrate from the TSS analysis, the juice pH was measured using a
Horiba™ table-top digital pH meter. Means of two readings were recorded per fruit

juice extract.

d. Titratable Acidity (TA). Titratable acidity of tomato was determined using standardized
0.1N NaOH solution as titrant and phenolphthalein as indicator. A 5 mL of the tomato
extract was titrated using 0.1N NaOH until the faint pink endpoint. The fruit extract was
obtained by homogenizing thirty (30) g of fruit pulp using a blender with 30 mL distilled

water. The mixture was then blended at high velocity using a blender, then filtered

45

through a cotton. The results were expressed as percentage of malic acid (mg/100g of

j. Ascorbic Acid Content. Tomato pulp (30 g) was crushed to a paste-like state for
approximately two (2) minutes (with intermittent stops to minimize heating) using a
blender. Vitamin C content of the fruit was determined by redox titration of ascorbic acid
with 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DICP) as titrant. The reaction involves the oxidation ascorbic
acid present in the fruit extract by DCIP until all ascorbic acid have been oxidized resulting
to an excess of the titrant. Any slight excess of unreacted DICP will result to a change in
color of solution from red to brown which is considered the end point of titration.
Standardization of indophenol blue solution:

Five (5) mL metaphosphoric acid—acetic acid solution and 2.0 mL ascorbic acid standard
solution was poured into each of three 50-mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Using a funnel, the buret
was filled with indophenol solution (dye) and the initial buret reading was recorded.

Titration was done by slowly adding indophenol solution with constant swirling to standard

46

ascorbic acid solution until a light but distinct rose-pink color persists for >5 s (takes about
15-17 mL). The final buret reading was recorded and the volume of dye used was
calculated. Blanks were prepared by pipetting 7.0 mL metaphosphoric acid-acetic acid
solution into each of three 50-mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Same volume of distilled water
approximately equal to the volume of dye used above (i.e., average volume of dye used to
titrate three standard samples) were added.

Titration of tomato extract:

Titration followed the same procedure as described above. The initial and final buret
readings for each titration of the blank were recorded and the volume of the dye used was
calculated (Nielsen, 2010). Another 5 mL metaphosphoric acid-acetic acid solution and 2
mL tomato juice extract was placed into a 50-mL Erlenmeyer flask. Each samples was
titrated with the standardized indophenol dye solution until a light but distinct rose-pink
color persists for >5 s. The initial and final readings were recorded and difference was

calculated to determine the amount of dye used for each titration (Nielsen, 2010).

Statistical analysis

All results were presented as means of treatments. The Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was computed for the measured traits as affected by each treatment using the Statistical Tool
for Agricultural Research (STAR) developed by the Biometrics and Breeding Informatics of
the Plant Breeding, Genetics and Biotechnology Division (PBGBD) of the International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI). Comparison among means was done using the Tukey’s honesty

CHAPTER 4

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Optimization Study 1: Synthesis Method for Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles

In this study, two different synthesis methods were compared in terms of efficiency in
the preparation of ZnO nanoparticles. In each method, the precursor for Zinc oxide and the type
of precipitating agent were varied, as well as the temperature during drying, which has a direct
implication on crystal formation of ZnO (Table 14). This part of the study was done primarily

to determine the most suitable starting materials for the ZnO nanoparticles.

Table 14. Method parameters for synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles.

no. agent
1 ZnSO4(H20); NH4OH 60°, 100° 8h

2 ZnCh NaOH 60°, 100°, 200°, 300° (2-4 h)

The synthesis products QZ1 and QZ2 were subjected to characterization test using Scanning
Electron Microscopy to determine the particle size and morphology of the nanoparticles. The
images in Figure 7 and Figure 8 were generated using a Hitachi™ TM4000 Scanning Electron
Microscope (SEM) and analyzed in Nanotech Analytical Services and Training Corp (NASAT
Corp.), Muntinlupa City, Philippines. Both SEM images show the synthesized nano ZnO at
10,000x magnification. The ZnO appear as rod-shaped, or strand-like, with at least one
dimension measured at less than 100 nm. However, the nanoparticles appear to be aggregated,
or agglomerated to one another. This is an inherent property of nanoparticles, owing to their

extremely large surface area to volume ratio. The ZnO generated from ZnCl2 and NaOH

49

appeared to be less aggregated and had a smaller average particle size as compared to the ZnO

produced from Zn sulfate + NHsOH.

Figure 8. SEM image of ZnO nanoparticles synthesized from ZnSO4 + NH4OH.

50

From this optimization study, it was therefore concluded that, Zinc chloride was a better
starting material as compared to Zinc sulfate in the synthesis of nano ZnO, since the former
produces crystals that are not only smaller in size, but also less aggregated and less clustered
with one another as compared to the latter. In the preparation of foliar fertilizer, these properties
are desirable, since more uniform dispersion and more absorption of the ZnO can be achieved

when using less aggregated and smaller sized particles.

Optimization study 2: Optimization of synthesis parameters for nano ZnO
using optimized starting material from study 1.

In order to produce smaller-sized and less aggregated nano ZnO, a second optimization
study was conducted by varying the reaction conditions, particularly the pH and temperature of
the reaction mixture, and temperature during drying and calcination (furnace) of the precipitate.

The effect of adding a cationic surfactant was also tested (Table 15).

Zinc chloride reacts with sodium hydroxide to form a white colored Zinc hydroxide
precipitate, while leaving sodium chloride in the aqueous state, as shown by the following

equation:
ZnCl, + 2NaOH > Zn(OH)2 + 2NaCcl
After drying, Zn(OH)2 was completely converted to into ZnO, as illustrated by the equation:

Zn(OH), + high temp + CTAB — nano ZnO, + H2,0

Temperature had a clear effect on the growth rate of salt crystals. Based on classical
nucleation theory, the variables that effect the nucleation rate are the supersaturation,
temperature, and interfacial tension. Increases in temperature or supersaturation, or a decrease
in the interfacial tension are expected to produce an increased nucleation rate (Mullin, 1993).
In theory, high temperature grows crystals faster as compared to room temperature and cold
temperature conditions. This is because a higher temperature increases the rate of evaporation
of the solvent, thereby speeding up the rate of growth. Different temperatures produce different
amounts of crystals. Colder solutions contract, forcing minerals closer together, thus creating
bonds, but catching impurities in their crystal lattice at the same time. These impurities interrupt
the crystal pattern, forming a larger number of smaller crystals. In warmer temperatures, the
distance between molecules is greater, which allows crystals to form larger, purer shapes at a
much more uniform rate than can occur at colder temperatures. This is the reason why the
temperature during crystal growth was kept higher than room temperature, at a minimum of 80

degrees Celsius.

In order to decrease the interfacial tension, CTAB was introduced into the solution in

the nano ZnO synthesis as a cationic surfactant. The growth process of ZnO in the presence of

52

CTAB is completely different as compared to when CTAB is not added. CTAB is an ionic
compound, which ionizes completely in water. The resulting cation is a positively charged
tetrahedron with a long hydrophobic tail, while the growth unit for ZnO crystal is considered to
be Zn(OH)2—4Zn(OH)4-, which also has a tetrahedron geometry, but it is negatively charged.
The positively charged CTAB ions passivate the ionized oxygen O on the surface of ZnO seeds
by electrostatic interaction, which suppresses the growth of ZnO crystal. Thus, the ZnO nano
particles with smaller size are obtained in the presence of CTAB. The influence of CTAB on
ZnO morphology can also be attributed to the reduction of surface tension of solution by CTAB,
which lowers the energy to form a new phase and ZnO crystal. Therefore, nanocrystals could
form in a lower super saturation. Moreover, CTAB could also be considered to influence the
erosion process of Zinc and the growth process of ZnO by the electrostatic and stereo-chemical

effects.

The synthesis optimization parameters were narrowed down to two different methods:
NZ1 and NZ2 (Table 16), since the other methods produced yellow-colored precipitate,
implying the presence of impurities in the precipitate. Pure zinc oxide appears as white crystals
in nature. The two methods that produced pure white crystals were labelled ZN1 and ZN2. The
only parameter that differed between the two methods was the solution pH during

crystallization.

Both NZ1 and NZ2 were synthesized using the same starting materials: ZnCl2 and
NaOH; but under different reaction conditions. NZ1 was synthesized at pH 7.0, whereas NZ2
was synthesized at pH 7.5 but the resulting solution was adjusted to pH 11.5 using 1.0 N NaOH.
A cationic surfactant, CTAB, was added, in order to promote dispersion between the nano ZnO

particles.

53
Characterization of the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles

The ZnO nanoparticles synthesized from the second optimization study were subjected
to characterization tests using standard instrumentation techniques for nanoparticle studies.
ZnO synthesized from different methods were compared in terms of particle size and
morphology, degree of aggregation, and chemical purity. Technical grade zinc oxide was also
analyzed using the same instrumentation techniques, and results were compared with that of the

synthesized nano ZnO.

Scanning Electron Microscopy — Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM-
EDS). In order to characterize the particle size and elemental composition, the ZnO
nanoparticles were subjected to SEM-EDS analysis. The images shown in Figures 9 and 10
show ZnO nanoparticles at 15,000x and 20,000x magnification, respectively, using a Hitachi™

TM4000 Scanning Electron Microscope with Bruker™ Energy Dispersive X-Ray accessory.

The SEM images for the ZnO samples produced from ZN1 and ZN2 show that the rod-
shaped ZnO particles are less than 100nm in size, thus satisfying the size requirement for
nanoparticles. In terms of particle size, the average particle size from six readings (measured
in the smaller dimension) for ZN1 is 45.65 nanometers, whereas that of ZN2 is 45.35

nanometers.

The property that distinguished ZN1 from ZN2 was the degree of aggregation of the
nanoparticles. ZN1 had more dispersion of nanoparticles than ZN2, as evident from the SEM
images showing more discernable individual particles in ZN1 than ZN2. Nanoparticles, owing
to their extremely high surface area, tend to aggregate with each other. It was therefore verified

that more dispersed nano ZnO can be achieved by precipitation at pH 7, as compared to pH 11.

NaOH + CTAB; at pH 7.7, & calcined at 200 °C for 2 hrs.

NaOH + CTAB; adjusted pH from 7.5 to 11.5 & calcined

55

In terms of elemental composition via EDX analysis (Table 16, Fig 10-11), ZN1 (pH 7)
produced a higher Zn% (59.96%) as compared to ZN2 method (pH 11.5), at 41.45%. The
percentage of oxygen was also higher in ZN1 (26.83%) relative to ZN2 (5.61%), which could
indicate that more ZnO molecules were produced in ZN1 method. Moreover, ZN2 had more
chloride impurities (52.95%) as compared to ZN1 (13.21%). The Cl impurities from the ZnCl2
starting material may have been trapped within the crystal lattices during crystal growth, or
could be adhered onto the surface of the crystals. This was addressed by washing the ZnO

precipitate more liberally using hot deionized water during filtration, and prior to calcination.

X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectroscopy. The ZnO products were also subjected to
X-ray fluoresence (XRF) spectroscopy in order to quantify the percentage of Zinc oxide in the
sample. XRF is a non-destructive analytical technique used to determine the elemental
composition of materials. XRF analyzers determine the chemistry of a sample by measuring
the fluorescent (or secondary) X-ray emitted from a sample when it is excited by a primary X-

ray source.

In this study, the model of XRF that was used to characterize the samples was a MESA-
50 Horiba Scientific X-ray Fluorescence Analyzer. The XRF results, summarized in Table 18
show that the ZnO composition of the synthesized material was 90.39% (Table 17, Fig. 13).
The Chloride ions that were detected in the XRF Spectra (Figure 13) were the aforementioned
impurities from the Zinc chloride starting material. The characterization test using XRF
Spectroscopy therefore confirms the purity of the synthesized nano ZnO. The obtained purity
of 90.39% in the synthesized nano ZnO is comparable with the technical grade nano ZnO

(Sigma-Aldrich), which is at 99% purity.

Fourier Transform — Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). The identification of the
atomic arrangement and the concentrations of the chemical bonds present in the samples was
carried out using Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), wherein the percentage
transmission and wave number are the output. Ideally, in the spectrogram for ZnO
nanoparticles, there is a characteristic sharp peak at around 400-470 cm™! which can be
attributed to Zn-O stretching vibrations, but depending on synthesis and other experimental
conditions, weak bands positioned at 520 cm”!, 566 cm’! and 665 cm’! are also possible to appear
in the FT-IR spectrum (Hernandez et al., 2007). The FT-IR spectra for sample ZN1 and ZN2

are shown on Figure 14.

varying reaction conditions.

The FT-IR spectra of samples ZN1 and ZN2 are shown in Figure 11. An overlay of the
red and blue-colored line shows the spectra for ZN1 and ZN2, respectively. The distinct peaks
at 506.33 cm"! and 515.19"! for ZN1 and ZN2, respectively, matches the characteristic peak of
ZnO. As reference, an FT-IR analysis was also conducted for a technical grade ZnO
nanopowder, and the FT-IR spectrum is shown in Figure 15. A distinct peak was also observed
in the spectrum at 502.89 cm’! due to the ZnO bond. This therefore confirms the presence of

Zn=O bonds in the synthesized nano ZnO.

59

The solution pH had a notable effect upon the number of crystals produced during
precipitation. In this study, it was observed via SEM imaging that at the solution pH of 7.7,
remarkably more crystals were produced as compared to the solution pH of 11.5. This is in
accordance to a study by Judge et al. (1999), where it was recorded that as the pH increased
from 4.4 to pH 4.6 the crystal number dropped by a factor of 1.5, whereas the change of pH
from 4.6 to 4.8 resulted in a drop by a factor of 20. This is a significant change over a very
narrow pH range. The effect of pH on number of crystals produced can be attributed to changes
in charge at localized areas on the molecule’s surface, indicating that macromolecule nucleation

rates may be very sensitive to changes in molecular charge distribution brought about by

60

changes in solution conditions. The precipitation of nano ZnO for the foliar fertilizer was
therefore carried out at pH 7.7 rather than at 11.5 as the latter is a more efficient method in
terms of producing higher number of crystals produced, smaller-sized crystals, higher ZnO

purity, and less aggregated nanocrystals.

The results of the characterization tests are sufficient evidence to conclude that ZnO
nanoparticles with high chemical purity, and desirable characteristics as nanoparticles, was
successfully synthesized using ZnCl. and NaOH as starting materials. The synthesized nano

ZnO were then used to prepare foliar fertilizers for the second part of the study.

Initial Soil Characterization

Based on the results of the initial soil characterization (Table 19), it was established that
the soil collected from Sariaya, Quezon was sandy loam. The total N and exchangeable K were
both found to be at intermediate levels, whereas the available P (Bray method) was high. A
high available P in soil, coupled with a sandy soil texture, are conditions that result to Boron
deficiency in the soil. Zinc levels were also found to be below the critical levels in soil. Thus,
the Sariaya sandy loam was an ideal potting mixture to observe the effect of the foliar Zn and
B fertilizers on tomato. The fertilizer recommendation of 200-220-300 (N-P20s-K20) kg/ha
was formulated based on this soil analysis. Soil pH was found to be acidic, thus lime was
applied prior to planting, and frequently throughout the growing period in order to supply
Calcium into the soil. During destructive analysis at 58 DAP and at maturity (74 DAP), the

soils were subjected again to characterization of N, P, K and Zn content.

Application of Zn and B foliar treatments

61

The Zn and B foliar treatments were applied at 40 DAP, 54 DAP, and 68 DAP (Table

19). These dates correspond to critical stages for Zinc requirement during growth period of

Marimax tomato: (i) flower initiation; (ii) after fruit set when it becomes approximately marble

sized; and (iii) at 2 weeks interval of second spray, or the reproductive stage of the tomato

(Sultana et al., 2016). The amount of Boron was increased in subsequent applications since B

62

requirement is higher during the reproductive growth or seed production stage than it is in the

vegetative stage.

In calculating for the total amount of Zn and B that will be supplied to each plant, the
following factors were considered: desirable levels of Zn and B in tomato plant tissue, the purity
of the Zn and B source, and the percent Zn and B content, as summarized in Tables 20 and 21.

The amount of boron that was added was the same for all foliar solutions from Treatments 6-9.

According to a study by Marschner (1995), the leaf concentration of Zinc that is required
for adequate growth of tomato is 15-20 mg Zn kg! DW of plant, whereas for Boron, the

desirable concentration is 40-60 mg B kg"! DW of plant (Sainju et al., 2012). In the soil, the

63

desirable concentration range for Zinc is at 10 to 100 mg kg “' with average at 80 mg kg =
whereas for Boron, the optimum concentration range is at 2 to 100 mg kg “| with an average of

30 mg kg”.

Plant height of tomato

Plant height of tomato was significantly different among treatments starting at 46 DAP
(vegetative stage). The SNZ+B treatment was significantly taller than the control treatment,
but was not significantly different with the rest of the treatments during the vegetative stage

(Figure 16). The differences in plant height were not significant during the flowering stage (53

64

DAP), but at 64 DAP and 74 DAP, which marked the fruiting and maturity stages, respectively,
the SNZ+B treated tomatoes were significantly taller than the control. During this period,
maximum plant height was observed in the SNZ+B treatment, followed by the SNZ treatment,
and CNZ+B treatment, whereas the lowest plant height was observed in the control. This
implies that the combination of Zn and B application has resulted to a significant increase in
plant height for tomato. These results are in accordance to the results in a study by Hatwar et
al. (2003), where plant height of tomato also increased due to the foliar application of Zn and
B. Zinc is a component of several enzymes and therefore affects many metabolic processes in
the plant. Zinc is an essential component in the synthesis for tryptophan, a precursor of indole
acetic acid (IAA), which plays a key role in both root and shoot development. Zinc helps on
auxin synthesis and in association with boron helps on cell wall development and cell

differentiation of plants (Basavarajeswari et al., 2008).

Number of clusters per plant

During the vegetative and flowering stages, no significant differences in terms of
numbers of clusters per plant were observed between the treatments. At 64 DAP, which marked
the fruiting stage of the tomato, the SNZ+B treatment had a significantly higher number of
clusters as compared to the control (Fig. 17). During maturity (74 DAP), the SNZ+B treatment
had the highest number of clusters (5.43), followed by SNZ (5.00), and CNZ+B (4.67) and BZ

(4.67). The control treatment had the lowest number of clusters (3.33) during the maturity stage.

The application of synthesized nano ZnO with Boron therefore significantly increased
the number of clusters per tomato plant. A high number of clusters in plants is advantageous
since more flower buds can be produced, and therefore more flowers can bloom and eventually

these flowers will develop into fruits. This could be attributed to the key role of Zn and B in

66

RNA synthesis and DNA formation in plants. Zinc also affects the indole acetic acid content
in plants which is important for regulation of plant growth. Thus, the concentration of Zn and

B in the plant is directly proportional to leaf growth and development in tomato.

Number of leaves per plant

The difference in the number of leaves per plant was highly significant (P<0.01) among
treatments at 64 DAP (fruiting stage), where SNZ+B treatment had the maximum number of
leaves (14.14), followed by SNZ (13.78), CNZ (12.67), CNZ+B (12.00), while the control
treatment was the minimum (11.00) (Fig. 18). During the maturity stage (74 DAP), maximum
number of leaves (average) was observed in SNZ+B treatment, at 15.90, which was found to be
significantly higher than that in control treatment (11.58) and the ZS treatment (12.22), but not
statistically higher with the rest of the treatments. The trend in the results for the number of
leaves per plant are in accordance to a study by Singh and Tiwari (2013), where number of

leaves of tomato also increased due to the foliar application of Zn and B.

Figure 18. Number of leaves per tomato plant as influenced by varying foliar treatments.

67

Number of flowers

During the flowering stage of tomato, the maximum number of flowers was recorded in
SNZ treatment. During the fruiting stage (64 DAP), maximum number of flowers per plant was
recorded in the SNZ treatment at 18.11, followed by SNZ treatment at 16.56. The lowest
number of flowers per plant was observed in the ZS+B treatment (10.89). The same trend was
observed during the maturity stage (74 DAP) (Figure 19). Statistical analysis however revealed
that the difference in number of flowers between treatments was not significant across all
sampling periods. Boron plays a significant role in the pollination and reproductive growth of
tomato, and when present in adequate amounts, can positively influence the production of
tomato flowers and fruits. Zinc, on the other hand, is responsible for the metabolism of RNA,
stimulates carbohydrates, proteins and the DNA formation, thereby increasing the potential of

the plant to produce flowers and eventually fruits.

Percent fruit set and number of fruits per plant

Highest percent fruit set among treatments was recorded in SNZ+B in all sampling
periods (Figure 20). The number of fruits per plant was not significantly different among
treatments during the first 3 sampling periods. At 64 DAP, SNZ+B treatments had significantly
higher number of fruits as compared to the control and the rest of the treatments except SNZ.
At 74 DAP, the maximum number of fruits was observed at SNZ+B treatment, followed by
SNZ, CNZ, CNZ+B, and BZ+B (Figure 21). Previous studies have already reported that the
combined application of zinc and boron increased the number of fruits per plant in tomato
(Yadav et al, 2001). Boron is known to be involved in flowering and fruit formation, thus its

deficiency can affect fruit set and yield in tomato.

SPAD units

SPAD readings were measured using a chlorophyll meter in order to determine the effect
of the foliar treatments on the relative chlorophyll content of the plants. Marked difference
among treatments were observed during the vegetative (46 DAP), flowering (53 DAP), and
maturity stage (74 DAP). Maximum values of SPAD readings for all treatments were observed
during flowering stage and decreased during the subsequent sampling periods (Figure 22).
During maturity stage, the highest SPAD readings were recorded in plants from SNZ+B
treatment (Table 28). Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between treatments

during the flowering and maturity stages only.

Zinc is known to play a key role in chlorophyll synthesis in plants. As a component of

enzymes, zinc catalyzes the synthesis of fructose-6-phosphate, an important metabolite in

70

glycolysis and therefore photosynthesis. Zn increases the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and
carotenoids ultimately proving beneficial for the photosynthetic machinery of the plant system

(Aravind & Prasad, 2004).

Biomass Production and Total Nutrient Uptake

During the first destructive sampling at 58 DAP, the SNZ+B treatment produced the
highest amount of above-ground biomass, at 0.42 tons per hectare while the minimum was
recorded in the control treatment at 0.20 tons per hectare. However, the aboveground biomass
production was not significantly different among treatments at 58 DAP. The dry matter yield
during harvest was highest in SNZ+B treatment, and this was significantly different compared
to all other treatments. The lowest amount of dry matter yield was recorded in the control

treatment. These results are in accordance to the study by Panwar et al, (2012), which also

71

revealed that tomato plant exposed to a concentration of 20 mg/L ZnO nanoparticles exhibited
maximum growth and biomass production. It was also reported by Alloway (2009) that dry

matter content of the fruits increased progressively with increased doses of boron and zinc.

Application of B and Zn to tomato therefore resulted in a significant response in terms
of total dry weight of plant at harvest. This trend can be attributed to the role of Zinc in
promotion of shoot elongation and fruit set, and therefore in the production of biomass. Zinc
is a co-factor for carbonic anhydrase, an essential enzyme for photosynthesis because of its
property to convert CO2 to HCO3" reversibly. Carbonic anhydrase plays an important part in
stomatal closure, which has an effect on photosynthesis. Thus, the deficiency of Zinc can

influence the biomass production and yield of tomato.

Zn and B uptake

Tomato plants treated with the nano-sized ZnO (SNZ+B) had a significantly higher Zn
uptake in both stem and leaves as compared to those treated with bulk ZnO, and granular Zinc
sulfate (Table 23-24), This is because particle size can influence agronomic effectiveness of
Zn fertilizers. Decreased particle size results in increased number of particles per unit weight
of applied Zn, and also increases the specific surface area of the fertilizer, which should increase
the dissolution rate of fertilizers with low solubility in water such as zinc oxide (ZnO)

(Mortvedt, 1992).

Since the individual ZnO nanoparticles weigh less than bulk-sized ZnO and granular
ZnO, smaller ZnO particles were used for the same weight, thus resulting in a better distribution
of Zn when applied, and the higher surface area of contact of Zn fertilizer resulted in better Zn

uptake.

The fruits were harvested at 80-85 DAP, at the breaker stage, or at Peel Color Index 2,
which is green with a tinge of orange color. The SNZ+B treatment produced the highest
marketable yield at 14.28 tons ha’, followed by SNZ (12.99 tons ha”), CNZ (11.49 tons ha"),
while the control treatment produced the lowest yield (4.99 tons ha’!) (Table 26). Statistically,
the differences between treatments were significant in terms of the marketable yield of tomato.
The single fruit weight was also found to be significantly different between treatments, with
maximum values from SNZ+B treatment at 47.23 g, followed by CNZ (43.47 g) and SNZ
(42.75), while the lowest values in fruit weight was observed in the control treatment (32.27 g).
A similar trend was also observed in fruit length, where control treatment had the lowest values.
In terms of fruit diameter or width, the control treatment was significantly lower (P<0.05) as

compared to the rest of the treatments, which were all statistically similar in terms of width.

The improvement in yield in tomatoes treated with nano Zinc oxide and Boron can be
attributed to the synergistic effects of Zn and B on fruit development in tomato. Zinc is
essential for synthesis of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme and photosynthesis, resulting in
increase in translocation of photosynthates in fruits; and positive effect on retaining flowers and
fruits. Boron, on the other hand, also plays a key role on accumulation of photosynthates that
has correlation with fruit weight. The reduced size of nano ZnO also may have improved the
agronomic effectiveness of the foliar fertilizer, resulting to enhanced yield and fruit quality.
Higher yield due to the application of B and Zinc have also been reported in previous studies

involving vegetable crops (Shukha, 2011).
Soil final characterization

Soil parameters particularly pH, total N, available P (Bray), exchangeable K, and
organic matter were determined after harvest. Soil pH was found to be acidic for all treatments,
and no significant difference was observed statistically. Total N, exchangeable P, exchangeable

K, and organic matter content were also found to be statistically similar for all treatments.
Postharvest Quality of Tomato

The postharvest parameters of the harvested tomatoes are presented in Table _. Total
Soluble Solids (TSS) is a refractometric index that indicates the relative proportion (%) of
dissolved solids in a solution. It is the sum of sugars (sucrose and hexoses), acids (citrate
and malate) and other minor components (phenols, amino acids, soluble pectins, ascorbic
acid and minerals) in the tomato fruit pulp (Beckles, 2012). The total soluble solids (TSS)
was highest in SNZ+B treatment at 6.06 °Brix, which was found to be significantly higher than

the control and the rest of the treatments, except for the SNZ treatment, which had the second

76

highest value, followed by the CNZ+B treatment. The positive effect of Zn on total sugars can
be attributed to its role in the starch and nucleic acid metabolism, and also to the activities of
various enzymes involved in the biochemical reactions during ripening (Alloway, 2009). In
terms of juice pH and firmness, no significant difference was observed among the treatments.
Titratable acidity was highest in SNZ+B, followed by CNZ+B, both of which were significantly

different with the control treatment.

Because acids influence the perception of sweetness, another useful indicator of tomato
taste is the TSS-to-titratable acid (TSS/TA) ratio (Beckles, 2012). There are two primary acids
in tomato, citric and malic (Beckles, 2012). A minimum TSS of 5 and a minimum %TA of 0.4,
respectively (TSS:TA of 12.5), is considered desirable to produce a good-tasting table tomato
(Kader et al., 1977). Only the SNZ+B and SNZ treated fruits had a TSS value of more than
5 and %TA of at least 0.4%. This implies that even without sensory testing, these tomatoes can

be judged as palatable and having a good balance of sweetness and sourness.

In terms of Vitamin C content, maximum values were recorded in the SNZ+B treatment
at 8.60 mg 100g", which was significantly higher than the control treatment but not with the
rest of the treatments. CNZ+B had the second highest vitamin C content at 6.32 mg 100g"
followed by SNZ at 5.97 mg 100g”. This is in accordance to a previous study by Lee and Kader
(2000), where pre-harvest factors including the Zn fertilization had a positive effect on ascorbic

acid content of tomato fruits.

Zinc plays an essential role in ATP and protein synthesis. Zinc is a key component of

RNA polymerase which catalyzes RNA synthesis, which in turn affects production of proteins

77

and manufacturing of carbohydrates. The amount of Zinc therefore directly affects the amount

of sugars in the tomato fruits.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

The synthesis method parameters for Zinc oxide nanoparticles were optimized in the
study. Nano zinc oxide was successfully synthesized via a simple alkaline precipitation
technique using Zinc chloride as starting material and sodium hydroxide as the precipitating
agent. The characterization test using SEM-EDX Spectroscopy verified that the synthesized
nano ZnO was less than 100 nm in size, and contained 59% Zinc content with a low degree of
aggregation. XRF Spectrosocopy further revealed that the synthesized nano ZnO was
chemically pure (90.39% ZnO), while FT-IR Spectroscopy analysis confirmed the molecular
structure of ZnO using a commercial technical grade nano ZnO as standard. These results were
sufficient to conclude that the nano ZnO was an ideal source of zinc as foliar fertilizer.

Foliar solutions containing the synthesized nano ZnO and Boric acid as Boron source
were prepared and tested on pot-grown ‘Marimax’ tomato in order to investigate the synergistic
effect of Zn and B on plant growth, yield and postharvest quality.

It was evident from the study that application of the synthesized nano ZnO, in
combination with Boron (SNZ+B treatment), had positive effects on plant height, number of
leaves per plant, number of fruits per plant, clusters per plant, SPAD readings, dry matter yield
and marketable yield. Fertilization with the treatments containing both Zn and B also led to
significant improvements in fruit quality, including higher TSS, %TA, and Vitamin C content,
whereas juice pH, and firmness were unaffected. Among the all treatments, the lowest
performance was recorded in the control treatment.

Zinc and boron improves fruit growth and yield since these micronutrients play key roles

in the synthesis of essential enzymes and growth regulators involved in photosynthesis and

79

carbohydrate synthesis, thereby influencing shoot growth, biomass production, fruit quality,
and yield. Owing to the small size of the ZnO nanoparticles, the particles can easily penetrate
the stomates as they are applied as foliar spray and therefore resulted in more efficient nutrient
use as compared to the commercial ZnO and granular zinc sulfate. Nano-sizing on ZnO also
increased the number of particles per unit weight of applied Zn, while increasing the specific
surface area of the fertilizer, which increased the solubility rate of ZnO in water thereby
enhancing plant uptake. It was therefore concluded that the use of nano ZnO has resulted to a
significant improvement in the effectiveness of the foliar fertilizers and in combination with

Boron at calculated dosages, has enhanced growth yield and postharvest quality of tomato.
