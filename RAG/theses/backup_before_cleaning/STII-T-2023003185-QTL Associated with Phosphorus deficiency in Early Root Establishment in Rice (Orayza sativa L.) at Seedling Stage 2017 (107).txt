ABSTRACT

One-hundred forty two F₁₄, Recombinant Inbred Lines from the cross between
Dasanbyeo (Indica) and TR22183 (Japonica) were phenotypically evaluated at seedling
stage, 14 days after seeding, under phosphorus deficiency in a hydroponic solution. The
RILs were selected and genotyped using Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) technology.
The genotyped data was used to correlate with the phenotype data of the 142 F₁₄DT-RILs
evaluated at seedling stage under phosphorus deficient condition. Nine-hundred ninety
two (992) markers were used to generate the genetic linkage map using inclusive
composite interval mapping (ICIM) software version 4.1. The generated linkage map
showed a total length of 3061.76 cM with an average interval size of 3.0864 cM.
Permutation analysis of the data was done obtaining an LOD threshold of 3.4068. Twenty
eight QTLs were identified in chromosome 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 explaining
5.6068 to 20.8062% of the phenotypic variance. The QTLs- number of crown roots
(qCR1, qCR3, and qCR12), root length (qRL1, qRL5, qRL8, and qRL9), shoot length
(qSL3, qSL5, and qgSL12), total projected area (q7PA6), total surface area (g7SA3,
qTSA4.1, qTSA4.2, and qTSA9), number of root tips (qTIP5, qTIP8, qTIP9 and qTIP10),
and number of forks (qFRK1, qFRK5, qFRK8 and qFRK9). Potentially good QTLs
showing significant LOD and phenotypic variance were selected because of their position
that is associated with other genes and markers. Fine-mapping of these QTLs - qRL5,
qRL9 and qTSA9 - is recommended for further identification of closely linked markers for
marker-assisted breeding purposes. The three QTLs are potentially good because their
position is associated with genes that could be underlying in their position.

INTRODUCTION

Rice is an important cultivated grass crop of tropical origin. As a cereal grain, it is
being grown widely throughout the world as a staple food especially in Asia. It is the first
food crop in Asia providing 50 to 80% daily calorie intake among rice consumers (Khush
2005). The significant role of rice in agriculture brought about rigid and thorough
researches on its genetic and morphological properties to enhance yield production.

Rice is a diploid (2n=2x=24) annual grass that belongs to family Poaceae. It
belongs to class Monocotyledonae thus; it has a fibrous root system. Its root system plays
a very essential role in plant development including the plants’ anchorage capacity, and
the uptake of water and nutrients (Dorlodot et al. 2007; Fujii 1961; Gewin 2010; Liao et
al. 2004). Rice root systems that would exhibit deeper, thick and more branched
morphology result in a better survival under water and nutrient deficient conditions (Price
et al. 2002; Yano et al. 2005; Zheng et al. 2000).

As the world battles the pressing environmental issues and challenges, yield
production of rice all over the world has been affected too. The unpredictable and
uncontrolled environment brings unfavorable conditions that pose a huge threat for
agriculture and food security (Kumari et al. 2009). Phosphorus deficiency is an abiotic
stress that is inherently widespread in rice ecosystems. Phosphorus is one of the essential
macronutrients needed for plant’s growth and development. A phosphorus deficient soil
affects root development especially during the seedling stage by reducing root mass

making it unable to reach more water and nutrients (Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000).

Root vigor in rice during seedling stage helps phosphorus acquisition and vice
versa. Root vigor is a vital characteristic that provide plants a better chance to survival
chance even in a nutrient deficient soil. It is a quantitative trait in plants that is associated
with the number of crown roots, root length, number of root tips, root surface area and
root mass. The crown roots help plants to absorb more nutrients and water from the soil
and provide strong anchorage. Longer root length extends the drawing power of plants
into the soil thus providing the necessary nutrient elements that it needs. More root tips
means more roots and a greater root mass. These phenotypic parameters provide
information in selecting appropriate varieties of rice that grow under low phosphorus
conditions.

A way to identify traits for root vigor under phosphorus deficiency is by the use
of molecular markers that are linked tightly to the genes controlling the trait. This is done
through the use of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping or QTL analysis that enables
detection of QTL associated with the different root agronomic traits. It allows the
identification of a specific chromosome region where the QTL lies. The information
obtained through this is used to improve the efficiency in the selection in conventional
breeding (Aliyu et al. 2011; Ghomi et al. 2013).

QTL identification will allow further understanding of the genetic control of a
trait. Unfortunately, there are only few existing QTL researches for root traits under
phosphorus deficiency tolerance in rice that were able to provide useful results. Apart
from the difficulty in the phenotyping aspects due to the rice roots’ delicate and fragile
nature especially during seedling stage, there is lack of a more specific marker system

that could identify potential QTL of the trait.

The advent and availability of high-quality rice genome sequences (Yu et al.
2002; International Rice Genome Sequence Project; 2005) paved the way for the
genome-wide discovery of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) as a marker system
in rice. This system identifies a single base pair variation that exists all over the genome.
They are more specific, much more abundant, stable, amenable to automation, efficient,
and increasingly cost-effective (Edwards and Batley 2010; Thomson et al. 2011). It has
proven to be reliable and effective in combination with Illumina Golden Gate array
technology especially for studies involving genetic diversity, introgression and QTL

mapping (McNally et al. 2009; Ye et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2010).

population obtained from crossing an indica Dasanbyeo and japonica TR22183 at
seedling stage.

Specifically. This research seeks to:

1. To phenotype Fi, RILs for phosphorus deficiency tolerance under

hydroponics condition.

2. To construct linkage map using SNP markers.

3. To identify QTLs for vigorous root traits during the seedling stage of RIL

population under normal and low phosphorus conditions.

4. To describe the association among root traits and other agronomic traits

Time and Place of Study

The study was conducted from April 2016 until January 2017 at the Plant
Breeding, Genetics and Biotechnology (PBGB) Division of the International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI), Los Bafios, Laguna, Philippines (14030’N, 121 01’E). The
seedling stage phenotyping and screening was done at IRRI screen-house BG 12 from
August to November 2016. Root scanning was conducted at the Genetics and Genomics

Laboratory (GGL), PBGB at IRRI from November 2016 to January 2017.

REVIEW OF LITERATURE

Phosphorus Deficiency in Soils

Phosphorus is one of the essential nutrient elements for plant growth and
development. It is needed by plants in large amounts because it is a vital component of
DNA and RNA. It is a key element that acts as a catalyst in the conversion of many
biochemical reactions in plants. It is also a component of the biological energy unit ATP
thus is required in all stages of development of the plants. It affects the major functions in
energy storage and transfer of plants. Specifically, it affects tillering, early root
development, root development, early flowering, and ripening (Crop Nutrition 2016).

Phosphorus deficiency in rice production areas is one of the most important
nutritional constraints to rice growth across the globe (Ismail et al. 2007). Phosphorus
deficient soils are characterized by relatively low amount of phosphorus present in its
available form. It is commonly associated with highly weathered soils that fix phosphorus
in forms that are rendered not available for uptake of plants. It occurs mostly in types of
soils such as coarse-textured soils with amounts of organic matter and small P reserves,
highly weathered clayey acid upland soils, degraded lowland soils, calcareous soils,
saline soils and sodic soils (Dobermann and Fairhurst, 2000). These soil types are
common in tropical countries of Asia and South East Asia (Fageria et al. 1982; Hedley et

al. 1994; Sanchez and Salinas, 1981).

Generally, at present, the most common P-deficient soils for rice production areas
are observed in areas with low fertilizer inputs such as those that are from resource-poor
farmers. This is due to the lack of available and alternate supply of P and the high cost of
commercially available P-fertilizers (Fageria et al. 1988; Sanchez and Salinas, 1981). P-
deficient soil can also occur because of inherent soil chemical characteristics such as
those found in rice tilled soils that have high native P-fixing capacity. This is common to
soil types with relatively lower or higher pH like acidic soils, acid sulphate soils and

alkaline.

Root Response under Phosphorus Deficiency

Plant roots play a very crucial role in nutrient and water uptake. This function is
potentially used to enhance plant productivity under a broad range of growing conditions.
Despite this, breeding efforts that aims to change the root morphology of plants are
limited. This is due to the underground location of the root systems that makes it difficult
to phenotype and selects good root characters (Paez-Garcia et al. 2015).

Plants exhibit different responses with different kinds of abiotic stress. According
to Paez-Garcia et al., (2015), the overall spatial distribution of all root parts in the plant’s
root system in a particular environment is called the Root System Architecture (RSA).
For any given environmental condition, there is a corresponding effect in the plant’s RSA
phenesf/traits. Traits like root depth, root hairs, root branching and other root anatomical

structures are important response indicators of the type of environmental condition or

abiotic stress the plant is exposed to. In the case of phosphorus deficiency, rice exhibits a
notable change in its root architecture especially during its early seedling stage. There is a
corresponding significant effect in the amount of phosphorus in the root’s size, shape and

biomass (Wissuwa and Ae 2001).

Seedling Stage Tolerance to Phosphorus Deficiency

Root phenotyping is difficult especially during the mature stages of growth in
rice. The root system is more complex and is more difficult to handle during later stages
of development such as late vegetative to ripening stages. It is during these stages where
roots are increasingly meshed due to the increase in number of adventitious roots and root
branches. The evaluation of root traits at these stages is near impossible due to its delicate
and unruly state (Paez-Garcia et al. 2015). Consequently, there have been few studies that
involve root phenotyping at reproductive stage (Courtois et al. 2009). Seedling stage
phenotyping is much adequate for root phenotyping for phosphorus deficient tolerance
trait. This is due to the early root growth development action of phosphorus. Changes that
occur in the roots during seedling stage pose a meaningful implication of the survival of
the plant under a given abiotic stress.

There is notable difference in the root traits of rice at seedling stage when exposed
to a phosphorus deficient environment. Gahoonia and Nielsen (1997), and Lynch and
Brown (2001) observed that there is increase in the root hair length and density of the

plant due to phosphorus deficient environment. This is an adaptation to improve uptake

by expansion of root surface area to acquire more nutrients from the soil. Another
observed response of the plant to P deficiency is the increase in root to shoot ratio. This
response is believed to have been due to the preferential assimilating distribution to the
roots (Fredeen et al. 1989; Mollier and Pellerin 1999; Vance et al. 2003). The adaptation
where there is an increase in the root biomass is due to topsoil foraging which is an effect
of the concentration of lateral root growth in the relatively P-rich top soil (Wissuwa
2005). Seedling root characteristics such an increase in number of crown

roots/adventitious roots is probably the result of the adaptation.

Genetics of Phosphorus Deficiency Tolerance

Phosphorus deficiency tolerance is already established as a quantitative trail and
is being treated so by most researchers. In rice, it has already been postulated that it is a
quantitative trait with high heterotic effects (Majumder et al. 1989). A study by Chaubey
et al. (1994) revealed that determination of QTL can explain the genetic basis of the trait
that would then help improve the breeding and selection efficiency.

There are two possible aspects of mechanisms that confer tolerance to phosphorus
deficiency in rice. The first mechanism is described as internal efficiency where tolerance
is achieved by thriving even at low phosphorus level conditions. The second mechanism
is the external efficiency. This is tolerance achieved by plants through their root
adaptation where they can capture unavailable soil phosphorous (Ni, 1998). A study done

by Wissuwa et al. (1998), found out that tolerance to phosphorus deficiency was largely

due to external efficiency mechanism of the plants. There is significant genotypic
difference in the phosphorus uptake among Near Isogenic Lines (NILs) tested, while the

phosphorus use efficiency had an inconsequential effect.

Molecular Markers

Molecular markers are genetic markers used as an important tool in molecular
breeding to manipulate characters of interests in plants. These are sites in the genome
sequence that are polymorphic and can be scored. They are used as experimental probes
that functions as tags to keep track of an individual, a tissue, a cell, a nucleus, a
chromosome or a gene. These markers are used in studies according to how they are
described: Semagn et al. (2006b) defined it as a landmark within the chromosome
sequence or allele that enables scientists to keep track of a gene or other pieces of DNA;
De Vicente and Fulton (2004) defined it as a known position in the genome that marks a
specific piece of DNA; Also, according to King and Standfield (1990), it is linked to a
gene whose phenotypic expression is normally easily perceived and is used to identify an
individual or a cell that carries it, or as a probe to mark a nucleus, chromosome or a
locus.

In plant breeding and genetics, genetic markers are classified into two categories:
classical markers and DNA markers (Xu 2010). Classical markers include morphological,
cytological and biochemical markers. DNA markers are DNA fragments that reveals

variation that are used to detect polymorphism. This is identified through molecular

10

technologies such as southern blotting (Southern 1975), PCR or Polymerase Chain
Reaction (Mullis 1990) and DNA sequencing (Collard et al. 2005). DNA markers as
molecular markers proved to be very useful in molecular breeding, taxonomy and genetic
engineering (Joshi et al. 2011). They are more advantageous than classical markers
because they are not affected by the environment and they are able to give reliable data to
analyze variation. Korzun (2002) stated that these markers are reputable tools to assess
genetic variability and characterization of germplasm; to identify and fingerprint
genotypes; to estimate genetic distances; to detect QTL; to use in marker-assisted
selection; and to identify sequences of candidate genes.

DNA marker is an important tool that helps breeders in selection especially to
shorten development time for varieties (Joshi et al. 2011). The reliability of DNA marker
used depends upon its kind. Over the years there are several kinds of genetic markers
used in molecular breeding. Joshi et al. (2011) and Guo-Liang (2013) elucidated some
properties of an ideal DNA marker for efficient use in marker assisted breeding: 1) a high
level of polymorphism; 2) evenly distributed in the whole genome; 3) should be co-
dominant in expression to distinguish heterozygote from homozygotes; 4) a clear allelic
features to identify different alleles; 5) single copy and with no pleiotropic effect; 6) cost-
efficient marker development and genotyping; 7) easy assay; 8) highly available and
sustainable to be multiplexed for data to be accumulated and shared between laboratories;
and 9) genome specific in nature; 10) no detrimental effect on phenotype.

Different molecular markers have now been developed and are made available for
the detection of QTL for different abiotic traits in rice. Markers such as the Amplified

Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism

11

(RFLP), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR)/Microsatellite and Expressed Sequence Tag
(EST) are widely used for different population types (Gregorio, 1997; Gregorio et al.
2002; Bonilla et al. 2002; Lin et al. 2004; Ammar et al. 2009). Among these,
Microsatellites are commonly used for QTL mapping in rice. According to Lang et al.
(2001), microsatellite/SSR markers are very useful in tagging and QTL mapping for salt
tolerance trait in rice. However, these markers are limited in abundance when saturating
genomic regions, they also have constraints in multiplexing and automation, and there are
difficulties in platforms and databasing. With the development and discoveries of the
advances in genome sequencing of rice, the use of SNP has proven to be much more
reliable and accurate. Thomson et al. (2011) postulated that SNPs are more efficient and
cost-effective marker system that have varying levels of multiplexing to suit range of

genetics and breeding applications.

Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Markers

SNPs are single base pair positions/locations in the genomic DNA where different
alleles are existent in an individual in a population (Jehan and Lakhanpaul 2006). Single
base insertion/deletion variants are not considered to be SNPs. And unlike other markers,
SNPs are bi-allelic in nature. They are found within the coding sequence of genes, non-
coding regions of genes, or in the intergenic regions between genes making them the

most abundant genetic variation in a eukaryotic genome (Kwok et al. 1996).

12

SNPs are individually responsible for specific phenotypic expressions, or could
represent a neutral variation useful for the evaluation of diversity in the context of
evolution (McCouch et al. 2010). SNP are now very popular and useful in molecular rice
breeding due to the following advantages: 1) they are bi-allelic making allele calling
simpler; 2) they are useful in high-throughput marker genotyping because they are
abundant in the genome and multiplexed SNPs is efficient and cost-effective; 3) SNP
data from different systems are easily merged in a database; 4) SNP chips allows rapid
scans of the rice genome at different levels of resolution for applications such as diversity
analysis, fingerprinting, QTL and association mapping, and marker-assisted selection
(Thomson et al. 2011). Moreover, the genotyping of SNPs are being developed with
public funding and made available for application in rice improvement (McCouch et al.

2010).

SNP Genotyping

Genotyping is a process done to determine genetic variants and is performed in a
variety of methods. One of the methods for identification of genetic variants is the use of
SNP markers. In the genome of an individual, SNPs occur mostly with an estimated
frequency of one per 100-300 base pair in plants (Edwards et al. 2007; Xu 2010). They
are the most abundant type of genetic variation with a variable distribution among species

(Rafalski 2002) thus, the probability of detecting polymorphism in a target gene increases

13

(Ganal et al, 2009). Also, in population studies, SNPs are a lot easier to be tracked down
because they are genetically stable from generation to generation (Kim et al, 2009).

The development of a high-throughput sequencing (next generation sequencing)
technologies that could yield 1000 or millions of sequences concurrently is driven due to
the demand for a low cost sequence data. The advances in the next generation sequencing
(NGS) technologies have made it possible to lessen the cost of DNA sequencing that
reached to a point that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now feasible in a range of
species with complex genomes (Elshire et al, 2011). GBS is a genotyping method that has
been used in many areas of genomic research. It is an application of NGS protocols that
is designed for simultaneous discovery and genotyping of thousands to millions of SNPs
from varying species of plants and animals. It has been successfully applied in genome-
wide association study (GWAS) genotype screening and genetic mapping by large scales
of plat breeding programs (He et al, 2014). GBS works by generating many molecular
markers through the combined data generation power of Illumina DNA sequencing with
that of the known molecular biology techniques in a streamline method. It takes
advantage of the capacity of Illumina sequencing to generate huge amount of data thus
reducing the cost per sample. It uses an efficient DNA bar coding system that can
combine up to 384 samples for sequencing (Elshire et al, 2011).

The NGS platforms that have been developed and used are Illumina MiSeq and
HiSeq 2500, Roche 454 FLX Titanium, Life Technologies 5500xl, Ion Torrent PGM
(Life Sciences) (Deschamps et, al 2012; Liu et al, 2012; Quail et al, 2012). These recently
used NGS technologies will pave a way for SNPs to become more popular than other

forms of molecular markers in the 21st century (Thomson, 2014).

Genetic Mapping

A genetic map generates a location that indicates the position and the relative
genetic distance between markers along chromosomes (Collard et al. 2005). The sites
indicated by the markers are points of the sequence of base pairs. Genetic mapping (also
known as linkage mapping or meiotic mapping) is the actual process of using DNA
markers to locate which chromosomes contain a specific gene and precisely where a
target gene lies on the chromosome. It also generates a physical map that identifies the
distance between genes in a chromosome (Semagn et al. 2006b). Maps are further studied
to increase the underlying cause of the phenotypic expressions. According to Angaji
(2009), approaches in genetic mapping such as QTL mapping and association mapping
are forward genetic approaches initiated to determine the genetic underpinnings of the

observable phenotypic variation.

Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) Mapping in Rice

QTLs are regions within the chromosome and are associated with a specific
trait/phene of interest, with single or many genes that underlie quantitative phenotypes.
They are responsible for any variations in the quantitative trait of interest (Doerge, 2002).
The process of detecting tight linkages of a molecular marker to a gene of interest is
known as QTL mapping (Collard et al. 2005). QTL mapping is used for the identification

of the responsible loci for the variation in the quantitative trait, such as phosphorus

15

deficiency tolerance and salinity tolerance. QTL mapping uses a statistical technique to
localize chromosomal regions that may contain the genes that is responsible to the
phenotypic variation in a complex trait of interest (Mauricio 2001).

The advantages of QTL mapping in the genetic and plant breeding researches are:
1) It provides an information of the inheritance and genetic structure of the plants within
and across species (Mackay, 2001); It allows the analysis of the genetic control
mechanism of a complex quantitative trait like tolerance to abiotic factors; and 3) It
facilitates the development of high superior rice varieties by combining favorable QTLs
into one line and it provides access to QTL pyramiding (Hossain et al. 2015; Mansuri et
al. 2012; Thomson et al. 2010).

A linkage map is required in QTL mapping for analysis. A mapping population is
required in constructing a linkage map. Mapping populations are derived from crossing
two genetically different parents, usually inbred lines, which show polymorphism for one
or more traits of interest. It is very important however to understand the nature of both
parents to ensure a successful crossing. The parents should be too genetically distant to
one another that they will not be able to cross or produce a sterile progenies (Semagn et
al. 2006; Mohanrao and Deepak, 2015). A mapping population requires 100 to 300
segregating lines or individuals. The individuals are then evaluated for both phenotypic
traits and genotypic constitution. When resources are available, it recommended to have a
larger population size to ensure a more stable and accurate statistics (Beavis, 1998).

Mapping populations in QTL mapping are usually obtained from controlled
crosses (Mohanrao and Deepak 2015). There are several types of mapping populations

but F, and Backcross (BC) are the most commonly used in molecular mapping studies

16

because they are simple and easy to develop in a relatively shorter period of time. The F2
population is produced by crossing or selfing F; hybrids while the BC population is
derived from crossing the F, back to one of its parents. F2 populations are preferred over
BC populations in detecting QTLs because it can detect QTLs with additive effect. The
detected QTLs are also provided with useful information to estimate the degree of
dominance. In a BC population, possible bias estimates are generated because it cannot
distinguish dominance effect over additive effects (Carbonell et al. 1993).

Although simple and easily obtained, BC and F2 populations are limited in a way
that they are only temporary and cannot be repeated. The possible recombination events
are few which make it difficult to study epistatic interactions (Semagn et al. 2010). More
permanent populations like Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs), Near Isogenic Lines
(NILs), and Doubled Haploids (DHs) have proven to be much more effective in QTL
studies. These populations undergo several recombinations (selfing and selection of
progenies until near homozygosity) that results in finer mapping and isolation of the
target QTLs (Guo et al. 2009; Bimpong et al. 2014). The individuals in the population are
near to homozygote or fixed so that they can provide a continuous supply of genetic
material for repeatability of the experiment. This allows collaborators to further examine
the same material which led to the accumulation of genetic information across
laboratories (He et al. 2001, Collard and Mackill 2008; Xu 2010).

The mapping populations are subjected to phenotyping where the individual
plants are evaluated for important quantitative characteristic traits. The precision and
effectiveness of phenotyping will determine the accuracy of the QTL mapping results

(Rahaman et al. 2015). The individuals being subjected to phenotyping are first to be

17

genotyped using molecular marker techniques. Once both phenotypic and genotypic data
are obtained, statistical analysis is performed to detect an association between the
markers and the phenotype to identify the loci that are affecting the traits of interest
(Collard et al. 2005).

A major QTL, phosphate uptake | (Pup 1), was identified from a traditional aus-
type rice variety kasalath inferring phosphorus deficiency tolerance. Pup 1 is found in
chromosome 12 and its locus was sequenced later showing a specific protein kinase gene.
The gene was later named the phosphorus-starvation tolerance 1 (PISTOL 1). Rice
verities that exhibit an overexpression of PISTOL 1 showed a significant enhancement in
their grain yield in a phosphorus deficient soil (Gamuyao 2012). A noted significant yield
advantage was also observed for rice verities with Pup | present in varying P-deficient
soil types and environment (Chin et al. 2010).

A QTL for deep rooting angle (DRA) in rice is an important trait that shows
increase in phosphorus uptake. Additional phosphorus taken up could result to a
corresponding biomass accumulation including root growth (Wissuwa 2003). Deep
rooting | (Dro 1) is a major QTL in chromosome 9 that confers roots to be pointed down
instead of sideways. It was detected in chromosome 9 from a mapping population of
recombinant inbred lines (IK RIls) derived from a cross of shallow-rooting cultivar IR64
and the deep-rooting cultivar Kinandang Patong (Uga et al. 2011).

Several developed programs are available that analyze and perform the QTL
mapping and linkage mapping. Among the statistical softwares for QTL mapping are: 1)
QTL Cartographer (Basten et al. 1994); 2) MAPMAKER/QTL (Lincoln et al. 1992); 3)

PlabQTL (Utz and Mechinger, 2003); 4) QGene (Nelson, 1997); 5) Map Manager QTX

18

(Manly et al. 2001); 6) MapQTL (Van Ooijen, 2009); 7) Epistat (Chase et al. 1997); and

8) inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) software version 4.1

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Plant Materials

Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) comprising of 142 lines was obtained from
Dasanbyeo and TR22183. Dasanbyeo is a divergent tongil-type (deriverd from IR8 x
Taichung Native | x Yukara) developed as a high yielding variety in Korea (Navea et al.
2017). It is responsive to fertilizer application with a genomic similarity of an indica type
variety (Kim et al. 2014). TR22183 which is considered to be a japonica type (Chin et al.
2007) from Northeren China is known to be nitrogen-use efficient. Both parent varieties
are known to be cold tolerant (Park et al. 2004). The lines were derived from the cross by
selfing and advancing to F\4 by single seed descent (SSD) method (Figure 1). The parents
of the RILs, Dasanbyeo and TR22183 have different responses to phosphorus deficiency.
Dasanbyeo showed a much more positive response under phosphorus deficiency (Navea
et al. 2017). The seeds were provided by the Plant Breeding, Genetics and Biotechnology
Research Division of the International Rice Research Institute.

Seedling Stage Phenotyping

The study used hydroponics for its seedling stage phenotypic screening. It was
conducted for 14 days after transplanting. The 142 Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs)
were planted in trays. There were two set-ups; one grown in a phosphorus deficient
medium and the other was grown in a normal phosphorus condition. There were four
replications for each set-up. Each tray can accommodate 24 lines with four biological
replications. Therefore, there were six trays per set-up. There were a total of 12 trays per

replication. The set-up was laid out as Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD).

The seeds were first incubated using a convection oven for three days at 50°C to
break dormancy. They were washed with 5% Zonrox to remove any contaminants during
its incubation or germination. After washing, the seeds were placed in a labeled petri dish
with a small amount of water for imbibition during germination. They were then
incubated in the dark room for three days to ensure germination.

Immediately right after pre-germination, seedlings were transplanted from the
germination room to the screen house. They were seeded in the “floats” (trays with
Styrofoam floats modified for hydroponic set-up) right after the embryo emerged. The
germinated seeds were planted in the floats for 14 days and hydroponic media was
replaced every three days from seeding. The pH of the media was monitored frequently
to maintain a pH range of 5.0 to 5.2. Gathering of the phenotypic data was done after 14
days from seeding.

The set-up used Yoshida solution as media for hydroponics. The phosphorus
concentration was modified to meet the normal and the low phosphorus conditions. The
concentrations for the remaining nutrient elements were not changed. Each tray contained

eight liters of Yoshida solution. Table | is a list of the contents of the hydroponic media.

Data Collected

Phenotypic data of the roots were gathered right after the fourteenth day from
seeding. The following root parameters were measured manually:
1. Number of Crown Roots (NCR) — number of counting roots per plant minus
the seminal root.
2. Root Length (RL) — length of the longest root in centimeters.
3. Shoot Length (SL) — length of the longest shoot part in centimeters.
During data gathering, root samples from 142 lines in the P-deficient set-up and

P-sufficient set-up were preserved for further phenotypic data gathering. The root

23

samples were then scanned using WinRHIZO scanner. For each root scanned, the
following phenotypic parameters were generated:
1. Root Tips (RT) — Number of root tips of the entire root system including
branches, seminal roots, and other lateral root parts.
2. Number of Forks (NF) — Overall number of root branching.
3. Total Projected Area (TPA) — The covered area projected by the roots in cm’.

4. Total Surface Area (TSA) — Total surface area of the roots in cm’.

Genotyping

There were 142 DT-RILs including the parents, sent for SNP genotyping at the
Genotyping Services Laboratory (GSL) of IRRI. The leaf samples were collected from
the set-up. DNA was then extracted for Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) using APK1
protocol (The Elshire Group Limited 2015 -2017) that will be used for SNP genotyping.

Leaf samples of the corresponding DT-RILS were collected from 14-day old
seedlings. The DNA extraction was done at the Genotyping Service Laboratory (GSL),
IRRI using CTAB mini preparation method. The isolated DNA quality was checked
using 1% agarose gel using 1x TBE buffer. The samples were run at 100 volts for 1.5
hours. The isolated DNA quantification and purity check was measured using the
Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, ND-100, USA). The DNA samples from the nanodrop

readings were diluted to working concentrations of 50 ng/pl using deionized distilled

24

water. The DNA samples were then submitted to GSL for SNP genotyping using
genotyping by sequencing.

Single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping by GBS was done in IRRI using the
following protocols below. The DNA samples were cut into fragments using methylation
sensitive restriction enzymes. Specially designed DNA molecules (incorporating bar
codes and illumina sequencing regions) were attached to the cut DNA using DNA ligase.
A DNA library was then made by running PCR to generate more copies of the DNA
molecules. A large data set was then generated by sequencing the library using Illumina
technology. Fragment sizes are evaluated and an analysis of the data was performed
comparing the sequences. Genetic markers then determine the differences (The Elshire
Group Limited 2015 -2017).

The data generated by GBS was then filtered using TASSEL version 5.0 and
Plink version 0.8 to evaluate the traits association and linkage disequilibrium. It was used

to filter out the data of no calls and non-polymorphic markers.

Data Analysis

The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the phenotypic data of the root quantitative
parameters was performed using SAS software version 9.3.1 (SAS Institute Inc., 2012)
and Statistical Tool For Agricultural Research (STAR). Pearson’s correlation was
performed using STAR to determine the relationship of the data. The correlation between

characters was computed at P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 using trait averages.

25

Construction of Linkage Map and QTL Analysis

The SNP genotypic data that was obtained from GSL was used to generate
linkage map using the QTL IciMapping V4 (Wang et al., 2016) which is an integrated
software for building genetic linkage maps and mapping quantitative trait. This was done
using functions suggested by Kosambi (1944). Linkage groups were established using
command group with the logarithm of odds (LOD) > 3.0.

The performance or root phenotypic data of the DT-RILs were correlated with the
SNP data to perform the QTL analysis. Mapping was performed using QTL IciMapping
not only to calculate LOD but also to remove multiple QTLs by extending the regression
equation to include more markers as cofactors (Ahmadi and Fotokian 2011). A
permutation test (1000 times) was used to establish a significant value at 0.05 and 0.01
indicating a 95% and 99% confidence level to be the minimum LOD threshold for each
trait in CIM (Doerge and Churchill 1996). The permutation test assigns LOD threshold
values that declare a QTL to be significant. The coefficient of determination (R2 = ratio
of the sum of squares explained by the QTL to the total sum of squares) estimates the
proportion of the observed phenotypic variance explained by each QTL detected

(McCouch et al. 1997).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Phenotypic Variation of F}4 D-T RILs Under

Different Phosphorus Condition

Phenotyping at Seedling Stage

The 142 DT-RILs were analyzed for the seedling root traits listed in Table 2. The
following traits for root vigor were evaluated 14 days after planting in a hydroponics set-
up.

The analysis of variance showed significant difference among the 142 lines for
traits total surface area (TSA) and root length (RL). There was also a significant
difference between the two set-ups, the phosphorus deficient and phosphorus sufficient,
for traits number of forks (FRK), number of crown roots (CR), shoot length (SL), and
root length (RL). For both the lines and set up, analysis of variance showed significant
difference in Root length parameter trait. The total projected area (TPA) did not show

any significant difference among lines or between the two set-ups (Appendix Table 3).

The mean and range of the 142 F,4 DT-RILs and their parents are presented in
Table 3. The distributions of phenotypic data for all the traits observed are shown in
Figure 2. The traits indicated a continuous distribution thereby indicating a quantitative
character. A positive skewness is shown in the distribution for the traits TSA, TIP, FRK,
RL and SL (Table 3). The result indicated that, for example in FRK (Skewness 1.089),
the population was averagely skewed towards the lower values in the number of forks.
This indicates that much of the distribution of values gathered is below the mean and few
values exhibit values greater than the mean. Negative skewness was observed for CR and
TPA which indicates that majority of the population showed higher value than the mean
that is, 13.6 for TPA and 33.4 for CR (Table 3).

In table 3, for the trait TPA, the mean value of the 142 DT-RILs (13.36)
indicates a closer relevance to the Dasanbyeo parent mean value (13.3064). For trait SL,
much of the values of the 142 DT-RILs were closer to the parent TR22183 as indicated
by their corresponding mean values (105.54 and 131.6667). The mean values of the
progenies were higher than the mid-parent value for the trait SL and lower mean values
are observed for trait TPA, TSA, TIP, FRK, CR, and RL. For these traits that exhibited
transgressive segregation, QTLs associated with it infers the appearance of transgressive
individuals. According to genetic studies, the appearances of combinations of alleles
from both parents that have effects in the same direction (complementary gene action) are
results of transgressive segregation (de Vicente and Tanksley 1993; Rieseberg et

al.1999).

Through the analysis of variance, the coefficient of variation of the eight
phenotypic traits was obtained. Among the traits, the data set for number of root tips (CV
= 48.85%) and number of forks (CV = 35.65%) exhibited the highest average ratio of the
standard deviation to the mean. The number of root length (CV = 12.74 %) and total

projected area (CV = 6.47) showed the least amount of variations in the data sets.

Correlation between Traits

Correlation analysis was performed in order to determine the relationship between
the different traits. The correlation matrix is presented in Table 4 using spearman
correlation analysis. It was observed that TPA showed a strong positive correlation with
RL while having a moderate positive correlation with SL. TPA indicated a weak
correlation with TSA, TIP, and FRK while showing a negative weak correlation with CR
(r = -0.034). This indicated that for example between TPA and TIP (r=0.1028), the
increase in the total projected area does not necessarily increase or decrease the number
of root tips. On the other hand, increased in the values of root length has also

significantly increased the value of the total projected area and vice versa.

ns: not significant; * and **: significant at P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively.

It was observed that TSA showed a strong and positive correlation with all the
traits except TPA. This indicates that for every increase in its value there is also a

corresponding increase in the values of TIP, FRK, CR, RL and SL and vice versa. This

32

data explained how the total surface area is affected by many of the root traits such as
crown roots and number of tips.

A strong negative correlation indicated strength in the relationship of the traits
while also indicating a different direction of the variable as it increases or decreases. In
Table 4, CR showed a strong negative correlation with TIP and FRK. This denotes that
for an increase in the values of the number of crown roots there is a corresponding
decrease in the values of the number of forks and number of root tips. The results
obtained from the correlation of the different traits as variables indicated a strong positive
relationship for most of the seedling root vigor traits. The following traits above that
showed a correlation are often mapped in the same chromosomal regions (Veldboom et

al., 1994).

SNP Genotyping

Genotyping was done using a 384-plex Genotyping by sequencing in an ApeKI
protocol. Out of the 180,599 markers used in the study, 992 (0.55%) exhibited
polymorphism between Dasanbyeo and TR22183 after filtering (Appendix Table 10).
Scoring for the markers was done with reference to the parents, the 142 RILs was
classified as homozygous for the Dasanbyeo type marker or homozygous for the
TR22183 marker. The 992 polymorphic markers were used as the genotype data and used

to run with the phenotype data for linkage map construction.

33

QTL Mapping and Analysis

A total of 992 markers were used to construct the linkage map (Fig 3). The
genotype data were arranged and formatted to a file necessary for it to be loaded in the
inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) software version 4.1 (Wang et al., 2016).
Kosambi function was used to convert the recombination frequency to genetic distances
in centimorgan (cM) based on genotyping data of D-T RILs. The linkages among SNP
markers were determined using command group with logarithm of odds (LOD) > 3.0.
The total linkage map generated a length of 3061.76 cM having an average interval size
of 3.08645161 cM. The QTLs detected determined an estimated (phenotypic variation)
PEV value or the phenotypic variation that indicated the percentage of variation in the
population for the different phenotypic traits. Significant additive QTLs were declared by

the LOD as threshold by permutation of the data 1000 times.

QTLs for root vigor under phosphorus deficiency at seedling stage were identified
through inclusive composite interval mapping using SNP markers. It revealed a total of
28 significant QTLs and was confirmed by permutation analysis (Table 5 and Fig 5). A
permutation test was used to determine the threshold value for the testing of QTL effect
tailored to the experimental data (Churchill and Doerge, 1994). The QTLs detected were
all named according to the QTL nomenclature suggested by McCouch et al. (2008). The
QTLs detected includes QTLs for number of crown roots (¢CRI, gCR3, and gCR/2), root
length (qRL/J, qRL5, qRL8, and gRL9Y), shoot length (qSL3, qSL5, and qSL12), total
projected area (q7PA6), total surface area (q7SA3, qTSA4.1, qTSA4.2, and qTSA9),
number of root tips (g7/P5, qTIP8, qTIP9 and qTIP10) and number of forks (¢FRKI,
qgFRKS, qFRK8 and qFRK9). The identified QTLs were located in Chromosome 1, 3, 4,
5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 explaining 5.6068 to 20.8062% of the phenotypic variance (Table

5).

QTLs for Number of Crown Roots (CR)

Three QTLs (qCRI/, qCR3, and qCR/2) were mapped in chromosome 1, 3 and 12
for the number of crown roots. In chromosome 3, a notable LOD = 5.474 was recorded
with gCR3 explaining 12.5725% of the phenotypic variation and a 0.4482 additive effect
from TR22183 parent. In chromosome |, TR22183 have an additive effect of 0.403 and

qCRI explains 9.9682% of phenotypic variance. In chromosome 12, gCR/2 was detected

39

with an LOD = 3.8392 explaining an 8.7617% of phenotypic variance and an additive

effect of -0.3839 from Dasanbyeo parent.

5, 8 and 9 for the root length. In chromosome 1, LOD of 4.129 was recorded with gRL/

explaining a 5.9985% of phenotypic variation and a -6.4852 from parent Dasanbyeo. In

42

chromosome 5, gRL5 indicated the highest LOD of 12.4051 for QTLs for root length

chromosome 3, 5 and 12 having the corresponding LOD of 3.8543, 3.6096 and 3.5817
respectively. The result suggests several genes controlling shoot length. Among the three,
qSL3 exhibited the highest phenotypic variance of 11.9769% with an additive effect of -
7.2496 leaning from Dasanbyeo parent. The other remaining QTLs for the trait exhibited

7.6149 from parent Dasanbyeo for gSL/2 were indicated.

43

QTL for Total Projected Area (TPA)

Only one QTL was detected for the trait total projected area. QTL g7PA6 was
found in chromosome 6 with an LOD = 4.1486 and having a phenotypic variance of

13.1473%, It indicated a 0.2604 additive effect from parent TR22183.

QTLs for Total Surface Area (TPA)

A total of four QTLs were detected for the total surface area trait namely g7SA3,
qTSA4.1, qTSA4.2, and qTSA9. Among the four, g7SA4.2 found in chromosome 4
exhibited the highest LOD of 10.9518 with a phenotypic variance of 17.1021% and an
additive effect of 1.5684 from parent TR22183. Both g7SA4.] and g7SA9 were from
parent Dasanbyeo having an additive effect of -0.9961 and -1.5455 respectively. A LOD
of 4.8644 for g7SA4.1 and a much higher LOD of 10.4898 for g7SA9 was shown with a
corresponding phenotypic variance of 6.8886 and 16.1736 respectively. Another QTL for
this trait is from chromosome 3. QTL g7SA3 showed an LOD of 3.4325 nearing the
threshold 3.0 with a phenotypic variance of 5.1333% and an additive effect of 0.8603

from TR22183 parent.

44

QTL for Number of Root Tips (TIP)

Four QTLs were found for the trait number of root tips (q7/P5, qTIP8, qTIP9 and
qTIP10). These QTLs were mapped in chromosome 5, 8, 9 and 10 for the said trait. In
chromosome 5, LOD = 5.8035 was recorded from q7IP5 having a phenotypic variance of
9.7301% and an additive effect of 4.148 from parent TR22183. In chromosome 8, q7IP8
was detected with LOD = 4.3084 with a phenotypic variance of 7.3145% and an additive
effect of 3.5066 from TR22183 parent. An almost similar amount of LOD = 4.1611 from
qTIP10 in chromosome 10 was detected with a phenotypic variance of 6.9931 and an
additive variance of 34239 from TR22183 parent. In chromosome 9, g7IP10 was
recorded showing LOD = 10.0746 with a phenotypic variance of 18.5392% and an

additive effect of 3.4239 for parent Dasanbyeo.

QTLs for Number of Forks (FRK)

For this trait, chromosome | and chromosome 9, gFRK/ and qFRK9 respectively
were detected to have an LOD score of 5.5728 and 13.1391. Both QTLs were from parent
Dasanbyeo having an additive effect of -4.3179 for gFRK1 and -7.1479 for gFRK9 and a
phenotypic variance of 7.7882 and 20.8062 respectively. In chromosome 5 and 8, gFRK5S
and qFRK8 were detected with LOD = 9.6477 and 4.4005 respectively. Both were from
parent TR22183 with an additive effect of 6.0148 for gFRKS5 and 3.7988 qFRK8 with a

phenotypic variance of 14.3977 and 6.0566 respectively.

45

The identified QTLs in this study did not correlate with previous works on QTL
mapping for root morphological trait at seedling stage. QTLs from other studies have
different populations and genetic background and the markers (other than SNP) utilized
are different. For that reason, the key basis for comparison would be the specific
chromosome where the QTLs were mapped. The gene that contains the phenotype is
usually linked or contained within the QTL found. Thus, both are found in the same
chromosome. This indicates that the QTLs identified with the highest LOD are potential
candidates to be mapped in a finer resolution that might identify a relatively small DNA
segment.

The QTLs that showed a LOD score higher than 10 are (RLS, qTSA4.2, q(TSA9
and qFRK9. Among them, qFRK9 and qRLS were the highest having an LOD of 13.1391
and 12.0451 respectively. Both QTLs mentioned above are good candidates for further
studies as their LOD indicated that the presence of their associated trait is high in that

region.

Comparison of Fi, DT-RIL QTLs with Other QTLs Associated

Root Vigor at Seedling Stage in Rice

For following discussions below, the comparisons of QTLs detected are based on
the directory found in the Q-TARO (Yonemaru et al, 2010) database. In the directory,

702 functionally characterized genes were annotated as of 31 March 2012. The

46

information of genes is organized in the database to facilitate comparisons with QTL
information (Yonemaru et al, 2010).

For root length trait, the QTLs that could be considered as a good and potential
for further investigation are gRL5 and gRL 9. QTL qRL5S in chromosome 5, as according
to its physical position, showed an underlying gene OsMKPlin the same chromosome
(Yonemaru et al, 2010). It codes for Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatase]
(MAPK) which according to Katou et al. in 2007, is a substance that has been observed to
play an important role in abiotic tress response, hormone response and microtubule
formation. Another QTL for this trait (gRL9) found in chromosome 9 matches a gene,
OsZHD1, which underlies within the range of its physical position in the same
chromosome as based on its physical position (Yonemaru et al, 2010). The gene codes for
a zinc finger homeodomain class homeobox transcription factor that is responsible for the
abaxially curled leaf phenotypes (Xu et al, 2014).

In chromosome 9 for trait TSA, g7SA9 showed a relatively high LOD of 10.4898
and a significant gene match underlying within its physical position. From Q-TARO
database, the genes Short Grain 1(SG1), OSEATB, OsbZIP72, cwal/bcl and Amy3A
were found within the physical distance of the QTL. Among these genes, cwal/bcl
which codes for a cell wall architecture 1/brittle culm Ithat expresses a lodging resistance
is more relevant to root vigor development at seedling stage. While the gene OSEATB
and OsbZIP72 expresses salinity tolerance and drought tolerance respectively (Yonemaru

et al, 2010).

47

QTL Clusters

There were two clusters of QTLs detected in chromosome 4 for traits number of
root crossings and total surface area. The first clustering in chromosome 4 is for trait total
surface area of the root containing QTLs- g7SA4.1 and gTSA4.2 flanked by S4_4650850

to S4_4941718 and S4_20266971 to S4_20274005 respectively (Figure 5).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

From the cross between the indica divergent tongil-type developed in Korea
Dasanbyeo and the Japonica temperate variety developed in Northern China TR22183,
142 F,4 Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) were developed as a mapping population for
seedling stage phenotypic evaluation for root vigor traits. The following traits were
evaluated during the seedling stage (14 days after seeding): Total projected area of the
root (TPA), total surface area of the root (TSA), number of root tips (TIP), number of
forks formed (FRK), number of crosses formed by the roots (CRS), number of crown
roots (CR), root length (RL) and shoot length (SL). The RILs were planted in a
hydroponics set up with reduced phosphorus condition. Results showed that the values of
the data gathered exhibited continuous distribution and transgressive segregation, which
was indicative of quantitative inheritance for the traits examined. A corresponding
genotyping using genotyping by sequencing (GBS) was done by collecting samples for
DNA extraction during the seedling stage development of the 142 RILs. A linkage map
with a total size 3061.76 cM and having an average interval size of 3.08645161 cM. A
total of 28 QTLs have been found from the population: three for number of crown roots
(qCR1, qCR3, and gCR12); four for root length (gRL/, qRL5S, gRL8, and gRL9); three for
shoot length (q¢SL3, gSL5, and gSL12); one for total projected area (q7PA6); four for total
surface area (q7SA3, qTSA4.1, gTSA4.2, and qTSA9); four for number of root tips (q7IP5,
qTIP8, qTIP9 and qTIP10); four for number of forks (gFRKI, gFRK5, gFRK8 and

qFRK9) and five for number of crossings (qCRS3, qCRS4.1, qCRS4.2, qCRS8 and

51

qCRS9). The largest QTL effect have been found in chromosome 9 and 5 with PVE =
20.7266% for RLS and PVE = 20.8062% for gFRK9.

The traits showed a significant degree of correlation with one another in negative
and positive relationships of the values of the variables used. Only TPA showed a non-
significant correlation with the other variables except for RL and SL. Two clusters were
found in chromosome 4: two for the total surface area of the roots and two for number of
crossing.

QTL mapping for the other stages of development could be done using the same
F,4 DT-RILs population to identify QTLs for phosphorus deficient tolerance. The lines
can also be further evaluated in its root character responses to phosphorus deficiency in a
soil field environment. The strong positive correlation of RL and SL with all the other
root traits (CR, FRK, TIPS and TSA) indicates an effective phenotyping for other stages
of development in the filed using RL and SL only. This will remove the limitations of
root phenotyping during later stage under field condition.

The use of large number of markers through GBS genotyping has proven that it is
effective in detecting QTLs and efficient because genotyping was done in a short period
of time. The QTLs detected can be further verified and established using varying genetic
background and different abiotic conditions. Sequence specific-SNP markers from genes
that exhibits positive responses for phosphorus deficiency of the root can be designed for
more efficient detection of individuals in a population. QTL mapping for the other stages
of development could be done using the same F,4 DT-RILs population to identify QTLs

for phosphorus deficient tolerance.

52

Fine-mapping for the QTLs qRLS5, qRL9 and qTSA9, is recommended to aid in
the identification of tightly linked markers for marker assisted breeding and QTL
pyramiding. QTL qRL5 in chromosome 5 is positioned between 642285 to 853674 (bp)
with flanking SNP markers S5_ 642285 at the left and S5_853647 at the right. QTL qRL9
in chromosome 9 is positioned between 18334152 to 18387845 (bp) with flanking SNP
markers S9_18334152 in the left and S9_18387845 in the right. QTL qTSA9 is
positioned between 17637176 to 18034390 in chromosome 9 with flanking SNP marker
S9_17637176 in the left and S9_18034390 I the right. The following good QTL

candidates are potentials for breeders for further root studies in rice.
