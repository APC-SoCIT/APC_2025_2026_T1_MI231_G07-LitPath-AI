ABSTRACT

Dugong (Dugong dugon) populations are known to be declining throughout its range because
of by-catch fishery, direct hunting, boat collisions, and rapid coastal development. It is
categorized as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List, indicating a high risk of extinction in the wild
in the medium-term future. In the Philippines, dugongs are considered Critically Endangered
based on DENR’s Administrative Order No. 2019-09. This study aimed to inform the
conservation management of the dugongs in Calauit Island, Busuanga through identifying
confirmed daylight space use (CDSU) and confirmed daylight core areas (CDCA) of dugongs
based on sightings generated from simultaneous land-based monitoring surveys. Four two-day
surveys were conducted in 2019 which resulted to 365 dugong sighting events across 30-32
monitoring stations (most manned by local Indigenous Peoples) situated within the Calauit
Island Group in Northern Busuanga, Philippines. Using Kernel Density Analysis (KDE), the
95% Utilization Distribution (UD) was used to estimate the CDSU, while 50% UD reflects the
CDCA. The total dugong CDSU (95% KDE) was approximately 4.6km² spanning across all
survey areas, while the total CDCA (50%KDE) was approximately 0.7km² which represented
15.2% of the CDSU. The nearby islands (hereinto referred as off-shore islands), Dimipac and
Maltanobon, had the highest KDE ratio, characterized with a relatively high proportion of
CDCA within its CDSU. These offshore islands also have the highest mean sighting duration
of dugongs (19.82 min), and calves (22.73 min). Three pairs of mother and calf were seen in
Dimipac 2 in May 2019 and in Maltanobon in June 2019. Aban-aban and Elhan 1, were notably
frequented by dugongs with 30 and 23 sightings, respectively. Through opportunistic spot
surveys, seagrass was observed in depths between 1.5 to 27 m, with deep-water seagrasses
(15m) with the presence Halophila sp. observed in CDCAs off Aban-aban (23-27m) and
Kawiren (18-20m). Fishers perception survey (n=58) on dugong population in Calauit Island
revealed that all respondents ‘frequently’ see dugongs around the island, and that 52
tespondents (89.66%) have seen dugongs ‘several times’ in the past year. Additionally, perceived important dugong areas include Aban-aban (n=25) and Kawiren (n=19). Furthermore, in this study, which aimed to elucidate space use patterns in a relatively small
spatial scale, observations of shallow and deep-water seagrass patches off the coast of Kawiren,
Aban-aban, Pagdukon and Dimipac indicate the potential spatial heterogeneity of foraging habitats, given the availability of both intertidal and subtidal seagrass beds. While space use fidelity within the Calauit Island Group has yet to be studied, the location
appears to be an important dugong area in Palawan with calf sightings indicating a reproducing
population. Expansion of monitoring stations within the region could therefore identify
interconnectivity of space use and reveal movement and habitat use patterns of dugongs on a
larger scale within the regional network. Ultimately, this study has shown that systematic
surveys coupled with citizen science could generate useful data in developing conservation
objectives for dugongs in Northern Busuanga and is an important strategy towards the monitoring of dugongs in localized populations.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the study

Understanding spatial distributional patterns of a population provides insight to its ecology and
how it utilizes space (e.g., Hooker et al. 2002). This has been conducted by estimating and
characterizing space use and home ranges of species. Kernohan et al. (2001) considered the
variability of space use at a temporal time scale and defined home range as “the extent of area
with a defined probability of occurrence of an animal during a specified time period.
Determining space use patterns of an animal can then illuminate aspects of an animal’s territory
and describe its mating systems and foraging ecology (Hooker et al. 2002). Similarly, according
to Borger et al. (2008), space use is determined by the interplay of individual traits of an animal
and the external environment. Home range analysis or space use analysis has been widely used
by different researchers to understand a population by defining its size, shape, and examining
its overlap with various threats (Richard et al. 2014). Some studies have analyzed seasonal
changes (Braham et al. 2015), while others determined the resources within the home range
(Bowden et al. 2015; Quinton, 2016). Examining how an animal population utilize space can
therefore be used as a guide in identifying critical habitat areas including important feeding
areas which are important to manage for animals that are at risk from potential human-induced

threats (Flores and Bazzalo, 2004).

This study analyzed daily used areas of the dugongs and aimed to infer confirmed daylight
space use (CDSU) patterns of the population in the inshore waters of the Calauit Island group

in Busuanga Philippines.

The dugong (Dugong dugon) is categorized as Vulnerable (VU) in the International Union of
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List (Marsh and Sobtzick, 2019). Globally, the dugong is
facing such threats including incidental catches, habitat degradation, rapid coastal development,

while some are injured in boat collisions (CMS, 2006). While sites in Australia support a large

population, it is considered extinct in different regions including the Maldives, Taiwan, and
Mauritius (Marsh and Sobtzick, 2019). Regional assessment conducted by Marsh et al. (2011)
also concluded that the population in archipelagic Southeast Asia as ‘Data Deficient’ (Marsh
and Sobtzick, 2019). In the Philippines, dugongs are considered Critically Endangered based
on Section 2 (List of Threatened Fauna Species and their Categories) of DENR Administrative

Order No. 2019-09.

Dugongs are ecologically important because they enhance nutrient cycling by cultivating the
substrate while grazing on seagrass beds. When foraging on seagrass in a serpentine manner, it
has the capability of releasing the trapped minerals in the sediments into the water column,
which consequently increases the productivity of the seagrass ecosystem (Preen, 1992;

Aragones, 1996; Aragones and Marsh, 2000; Aragones et al. 2006; Aragones et al. 2012a).

Conservation actions have been made to encourage the protection of dugongs globally,
including those in the Philippines. This includes being covered in three international
conservation conventions including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the
Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)
and the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). This species is also included
in the goal five (Threatened species) of the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI). All of these serve
as basis in the development of legal frameworks that provide guidance on the protection and
conservation of multiple threatened and endangered species, including the dugongs.
Furthermore, its important seagrass habitats are also protected under the Convention on

Wetlands (Ramsar Convention) (Marsh and Sobtzick, 2015).

The continuing decline of seagrass beds of about 7% each year also threatens this species
(Waycott et al. 2009; Short et al. 2011). Coastal development, among other threats, has caused
a 30-40% decline in seagrass cover in the last 50 years (Fortes, 2013), threatening the remaining
dugongs in the country that highly depend on seagrass as their source of food. The increasing
intensity of coastal development is evident in the Palawan islands which is known to be an
important feeding habitat of dugongs in the Philippines (Hines et al. 2012). In fact, Marsh et al.


(2002) has identified Calauit Island, Busuanga, located in the Palawan province, as one of the

priority sites for dugong research and conservation.

1.2 Statement of the Problem

The dugong is already extinct in different island states while its population is significantly
declining in at least a third of areas where it is found (Marsh and Sobtzick, 2015). Its status has
been extensively assessed in Australia and Saudi Arabia, while information on its status in most
of its range is unavailable or purely anecdotal. In the Philippines, there is limited to no data on
how these dugongs utilize their seagrass habitat, and how it interacts with its changing
environment which is possibly causing its decline throughout its range. Thus, there is a need to
comprehensively examine the space use patterns of dugongs to determine ecologically
important areas and infer risk based on the presence of human-induced disturbances such as

fishing practices.

Understanding the interaction of all these factors will lead to the formulation of appropriate
conservation and management strategies such as the establishment of dugong conservation

areas that are essential to the survival of the remaining dugong population.

1.3 Objectives
The general objective of the study is to inform the conservation management of the Dugong
(Dugong dugon) in the inshore waters of the Calauit Island group, Busuanga by:

1. Identifying and estimating the size of locations of confirmed daylight space use
(CDSU) and the confirmed daylight core areas (CDCA) associated with these
locations within the shores of the main islands;

2. Characterizing how these important locations (CDSU and CDCA) vary
seasonally;

3. Characterizing the water depth and bottom type of the CDSU; and

4, Assessing the perception of fishers regarding dugongs in these important

locations.

1.4 Significance of the study

Dugongs are known to have an ecological importance, enhancing the nutrient cycling in the
seagrass ecosystem through grazing and/or browsing (Preen, 1992; Aragones, 1996; Aragones
and Marsh, 2000; Aragones et al. 2006; Aragones et al. 2012a). Moreover, there is no equivalent
natural disturbance on seagrass beds that can replace the enhancing effects of grazing by
dugongs. Thus, it is important to protect this species to maintain the productivity of the seagrass
ecosystem. The information provided by this study was useful to better understand the activity
space and space-use patterns of dugongs around the Calauit Island Group through
characterizing these important locations. Ultimately, the systematic documentation of dugong
sightings vis a vis important feeding areas are vital information in the science-based decision
making in drawing conservation plans for the species, specifically for the establishment of

Dugong Conservation Areas around Calauit Island, Busuanga.

1.5 Conceptual framework

The space use analysis of dugongs in Calauit Island was done within the context of the dugong
conservation framework presented in Figure 1. The plus (+) and minus (-) symbols represent
positive and negative relationships, respectively, among the dugongs, its seagrass habitat, and
with indigenous peoples and local communities. The grazing of dugongs enhances nutrient
cycling thereby increasing the productivity of the seagrass ecosystem (Preen, 1992; Aragones,
1996; Aragones and Marsh, 2000; Aragones et al. 2006; Aragones et al. 2012a). Communities,
on the other hand, benefit from this productivity since it is the spawning and breeding ground
of economically important marine organisms (Jackson, 2009; Marsh et al. 2011; Honda et al.

2013).

While the dugong is considered culturally significant in some communities, they are also
vulnerable to anthropogenic threats such as fishing gear entanglement and boat collisions
(Hines et al. 2012; Marsh et al. 2011). In Calauit Island, in lieu of the ongoing utilization of
Sitio Aban-aban as a dugong watching area, it is also therefore important to involve local

communities through citizen science for a holistic approach to dugong conservation.

CHAPTER 2

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

2.1 Space use or Home range

Home range is defined as an “area traversed by an individual for its normal activities like food
gathering, mating and caring for young” (Burt, 1943). It represents an interplay between the
environment and an animal’s understanding of that environment forming its own cognitive map
(Borger et al. 2008; Peters, 1978; Powell, 2000; Spencer 2012). This cognitive map of the
animal is therefore the space required by the animal to meet its needs under a given set of
constraints such as resource availability (Flores and Bazzalo, 2004). It is also defined as the
animal’s space use which is determined by the interaction of individual traits and its external
environment (Borger et al. 2008) and could also vary during a specified time period (Kernohan
et al. 2001). This is the reason why determining space use patterns can help understand an
animal’s behavior while utilizing that important space, and at the same time understanding its
foraging ecology, mating systems, how it communicates, and how it cares for the young

(Hooker et al. 2002).

Home range or space use analysis has been widely used by different researchers to understand
a population by defining its size, shape, and examining its overlap with various threats (Richard
et al. 2014). In most cases, an individual’s home range is estimated as the 95% utilization
distribution of its sightings, which reflects an individual’s activity space over the tracking
period (Deutsch et al. 2022). Some studies have analyzed regional variations in range size
(Preen 1992; Campbell et al. 2010; Cleguer et al. 2020; Sheppard et al. 2006), seasonal changes
(Nietschmann, 1984; Braham et al. 2015), within-season range fidelity, (Zeh et al. 2018;
Sheppard et al. 2006; D’Souza et al. 2015; Udyawer et al. 2019) while some determined the

resources within the home range (Bowden et al. 2015; Quinton, 2016).

It has also been used to study the population of cetaceans such as understanding the influence

of prey in their distribution (Flores & Bazzalo, 2004; Hung & Jefferson, 2004; Elwen et al.

2006; Parra, 2006; Benoit-Bird et al. 2004; Lammers, 2004) such as that of spinner dolphins
(Stenella longirostris) in Hawaii (Lammers, 2004) and Dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus
obscurus) (Benoit-Bird et al. 2004). A study on the influence of seasons on the spatial
distribution of tuxuci (Sotalia fluviatis) was also attributed to the distribution of prey (Flores

and Bazzalo, 2004).

2.2 The Dugong (Dugong dugon)

2.2.1 Taxonomy and description

The Dugong (Dugong dugon) belongs to the Family Dugongidae. It is listed as Vulnerable by
the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Marsh and Sobtzick, 2019). It occurs in the Indo-
West Pacific Ocean found mainly on coastal and island waters between East Africa and
Vanuatu between latitudes of about 27° north and south of equator. The outlook for dugongs in
countries with a small dugong population and/or low Human Development Index (HDI) is
assessed as poor, which include countries such as Brunei, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Japan.
Kenya, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, and Vietnam, among others (Marsh and Sobtzick.
2019). Substantial populations of dugongs, on the other hand, can be found in four countries or
territories with very high HDI including Australia, New Caledonia, Quatar and United Arab
Emirates (Marsh and Sobtzick, 2019; Marsh et al. 2011), with the Australian population being
the most substantial. A regional assessment conducted by Marsh et al. (2011) revealed that the
population in the archipelagic East and Southeast Asia remains ‘Data Deficient’ (Marsh and

Sobtzick, 2019).

Their facial morphology, characterized of having a strong rostral deflection, is adapted to their
bottom feeding strategy (Best, 1981; Domning, 1982; Colares and Colares, 2002; Marshall et
al. 2003; Aragones et al. 2012a). It uses their bristles to crop the blades of aquatic vegetation
and excavate the root system (below-ground biomass) and rhizomes from the substrate, leaving

its signature “feeding trail” mark on the sea floor (Anderson and Birtles 1978; Preen 1995;

Keith-Diagne et al. 2022). While studies show that they spend most of their time at water depths
less than 3 meters (Chilvers et al. 2004), they are also reported to occur 58km from the coast
with depth reaching up to 37 meters, and with feeding trails seen up to depths of 33meters
(Marsh and Saafeld, 1990; Lee Long and Coles, 1997; Lee Long et al. 1996). According to
Keith-Diagne et al. (2022), dugongs are found over deep-water seagrass beds in some parts of
its range with dives recorded to more than 30 meters but no records beyond 40m, and with

maximum reported dugong dive duration to 12 minutes.

2.2.2 Diet

The feeding biology of sirenians including dugongs is characterized as aquatic herbivory and
that these animals spend much of their time accessing largely stationary food sources (Marsh
et al. 2011). Studies on foraging behavior of dugongs have been based on visual observations
(Anderson and Birtles 1978; Anderson 1998) and using a ‘blimp-cam’ (Hodgson, 2004), while
diet studies have been based on gut analysis using direct observation (Johnstone and Hudson
1981; Heinsohn and Birch 1972; Marsh et al. 1982; Preen 1995) and Near Infra-red Reflectance
Spectroscopy (Andre and Lawler, 2003). Rasheed et al. (2017) also developed techniques using
aerial photography and machine learning to study dugong feeding trails in intertidal seagrass
beds. According to Marsh et al. (2011), dugongs consume approximately 26 species of
seagrasses that occur within their range (Green and Short, 2003), marine algae as documented
in Australia (Whiting, 2002a; Whiting, 2002b; Whiting, 2008) including in some environments
when seagrass communities have been damaged by extreme weather events (Spain and
Heinsohn 1973; Marsh et al. 1982), as well as on invertebrates to meet their nitrogen
requirement (Keith-Diagne et al. 2022; Preen, 1995). According to Preen (1995), dugongs could
be less omnivorous in the tropics due to the availability of young shoots with nitrogen content

throughout the year.

While plant species consumed by dugongs vary depending on the region, habitat type. and

availability of food sources (Keith-Diagne et al. 2022), several studies suggest that dugongs


feed on Halophila ovalis, H. minor, H. spinulosa, H. decipiens, Halodule uninervis, H.
pinifolia, Syringodium isoetifolium, Thalassia hemprichii, Zostera capricorni, Cymodocea
serrulate, C. rotundata, and Enhalus acoroides (Table 1) (Adulyanukosol and Poovachiranon,
2006; André et al. 2005; Aragones, 1994; De longh et al. 2007; Aragones et al. 2012). Dugongs
have also been recorded to be cropping seagrass leaves of Enhalus acoroides (Anderson 1982;
Nakanishi et al. 2008; Keith-Diagne et al. 2022) and that they do not eat the rhizomes of E.
acoroides likely because these are extended deep into the sediment or too fibrous to process
(Erftemeijer and Djunarlin 1993; André et al. 2005; Domning and Beatty 2007; Keith-Diagne
etal. 2022). Based on stomach content analysis (Marsh et al. 1982) and on observations (Wake,
1975; Anderson and Birtles, 1978; Preen, 1992; Aragones, 1994, 1996; Supanwanid, 1996), it
was also found that the leaves of H. ovalis are important food for dugongs (Aragones et al.
2012a). Some studies have inferred that low seagrass genera such as Halodule and Halophila
are targeted by dugongs in preference to more fibrous plants such as Zostera or Thalassia
(Keith-Diagne et al. 2022). In Australia, Halophila ovalis and Halodule uninervis were
observed to be preferred by dugongs due to their high nitrogen content (Marsh et al. 2011;
Preen, 1995; Sheppard et al. 2010) and was also found to be easily chewed and digestible
(Domning, 2022). However, according to Keith-Diagne et al. (2022), these claims on diet
selectivity are not supported by confirmatory data that takes into account the biomass of
available seagrass and no food choice experiments have been conducted on dugongs (Keith-
Diagne et al. 2022). In addition, other studies have also revealed that available seagrass species
and biomass are also determining factors on the diet of dugongs (Tol et al. 2016). Keith-Diagne
et al. (2022) cited that 7. hemprichii is likely an important food source in Torres Strait
(Johnstone and Hudson 1981; André et al. 2005) which supports a substantial population of
dugongs (Marsh et al. 2002). In Queensland, a study by Rasheed et al. 2017 revealed that the
presence of feeding trails is positively correlated with increased percentage cover and biomass
of a seagrass community dominated by Zostera muelleri. Moreover, inter-annual patterns in

feeding trails in Balikpapan Bay in Indonesia showed positive correlation with seagrass

biomass, above-ground/below-ground biomass ratio and wind speed (presumably due to the

availability of shelter from the wind) (Budiarsa et al. 2021).

In cases when other seagrass species have higher biomass, it was observed that dugongs may
switch their feeding strategies (Aragones et al. 2012a). They are believed to follow an optimal
feeding strategy wherein their feeding site selection is based on the maximum energy gained
with minimum energy expended (Aragones et al. 2006; Preen, 1995; Sheppard et al. 2007).
This means that dugong’s feeding preferences could vary depending on accessibility (Aragones
et al. 2012a), seagrass availability and biomass (Tol et al. 2016; Rasheet et al. 2017), location,

as well as time of the year within a location (Budiarsa et al. 2021; Keith-Diagne et al. 2022).


2.2.3 Factors affecting feeding site

Physical characteristics of the marine environment such as depth, sediment type, water
temperature, water currents, and biological factors such as seagrass species, biomass above and
below ground, nutrient content, and digestibility (Aragones et al. 2006; Marsh et al. 2011;
Preen, 1995; Keith-Diagne et al. 2022), may affect the feeding choice of the dugong. In Calauit
Island, Philippines, the presence of dugongs were found in seagrass areas wherein biomass
ranges from 172 to 1494 g wet wt/m?, with the most dugong sightings (n=15) in seagrass beds

with a biomass of 172 g wet wt/m? (Aragones, 1994).

Studies have suggested that dugongs prefer intertidal feeding areas. This is because intertidal
seagrass has higher nutrient content and is said to be more digestible than subtidal plants
(Sheppard et al. 2007; Sheppard et al. 2008). Moreover, foraging in deep waters is assumed to
cost more energy and time than feeding in the shallows. This means that their habitat
requirements force them to remain in areas subject to human activities making them vulnerable
to anthropogenic impacts such as fishing gear entanglement and boat strikes. As a response,
some dugongs also feed on subtidal areas wherein it is less disturbed from fishing activities,

and tidal flows. Moreover, it offers 24-hour access to forage (Aragones, 1996).

However, these studies also suggest that different dugongs may have different foraging
strategies depending on circumstances i.e., low seagrass biodiversity and human disturbances.
It is therefore important to understand the reason why dugongs feed in certain areas to determine

which areas can be considered important dugong habitats.

2.2.4 Role of Dugongs in the Ecosystem

When dugongs graze, they uproot the whole plant, consume it and leave characteristic feeding
trails (Heinsohn et al. 1977; Preen 1995). One individual can consume an estimated amount of
28-40kg per day (Preen, 1992; Aragones, 1994; Aragones et al. 2012a), and has the ability of
overturning 263-904 m? of seagrass each day (Marsh et al. 2005). In Moreton Bay, Australia,


it was estimated that a group of 200 dugongs were able to feed on a square kilometer of seagrass
per week (Preen, 1992). They feed on large amounts of seagrasses allowing them to have the
capacity of altering the nutritional quality and species composition in their feeding areas
(Aragones et al. 2012a). This natural disturbance through herbivory can facilitate nutrient
cycling by reducing the plant material that passes through the slow detrital pathway that will
undergo decomposition. A more efficient nutrient cycling can then increase plant diversity and
biological productivity (Aragones et al. 2012a). In different herbivory experiments, it was
observed that biomass of H. ovalis, a preferred seagrass species of dugongs, increased 10
months after intensive grazing (Aragones et al. 2006). In Australia, species composition in a
seagrass meadow at Ellie Point, Queensland shifted from Zostera and Cymodocea to H. ovalis
(Aragones and Marsh, 2000). In Moreton Bay, the seagrass meadow shifted from Zostera to
Halophila and Halodule species after intensive grazing by dugongs (Preen, 1992). Table 2
shows that H. ovalis has the fastest growth rate and shortest turn-over time as compared to both
Z. capricorni and C. rotundata. This suggests that short and opportunisitc life histories of
seagrass species such as that of H. ovalis makes them adaptable to disturbance such as grazing,

allowing them to colonize areas grazed by dugongs (Hines et al. 2012).

Table 2. Growth rates and turn-over time for some seagrass species (from Aragones and

Marsh, 2000)
Species Specific growth rate | Turn-over time | Source
(% per day) (days)
Halophila ovalis 4.0-9.0 11-24 Hillman and
McComb (1998)
Zostera capricorni__| 0.8-3.5 33-67 Kirkman et al. 1982
Cymodocea 2.4-4.0 25-40 Brouns (1987)
rotundata

Studies have also suggested that continuous grazing of Halophila ovalis and Halodule uninervis
led to increased nitrogen concentrations by 35 and 25%, respectively, but lower starch

concentrations (Aragones et al. 2012a).


The physical action of grazing also has the capacity of introducting detritus and aeration into
the sediment, which promotes the activity of the N-fixing bacteria (Aragones et al. 2012a),
suggesting that nitrogen fixation rates are highest in grazed seagrass areas (Perry and Dennison,
1999; Aragones et al. 2012a). Indeed, grazing by dugongs have been found to be important in
maintaining the productivity of the seagrass community (Preen, 1992; Aragones, 1996;

Aragones and Marsh, 2000; Aragones et al. 2006; Aragones et al. 2012a).

2.2.5 Vulnerability of dugongs and human-induced threats

In general, dugongs are vulnerable because of their reproductive biology coupled with
anthropogenic disturbances. While they are long lived (~70 years) and slow to reach sexual
maturity (4-17 years), their average offspring is only 1 individual, and they produce an offspring
only every 3-7 years (Kwan, 2002). Moreover, the mother nurses her offspring with an average
lactation period of about 14-18 months. This makes the calf dependent on the mother for its
survival. All these intrinsic factors result to a slow rate of population increase of less than 5%

per year (Marsh, 1995).

Dugongs are also threatened because of anthropogenic influences. Being a coastal marine
mammal, they are vulnerable to changes in the marine environment because of the increase in
human population living near the coast (Marsh et al. 2003). They are mostly affected by their

interaction with fisheries i.e fishing gear entanglement and boat collisions (CMS, 2006).

Habitat modifications including the degradation of their seagrass habitat, acoustic and chemical
pollution, and marine debris are also some of the threats to their survival (Marsh et al. 2003;
Hooker and Gerber, 2004). Modifications in the quality of the habitat (i.e., reduced available
forage) is also said to be a multiplier effect in the slow population increase because dugongs

may respond by reducing fecundity (Kwan, 2002).


2.3 Dugongs in the Philippines

In the Philippines, a series of studies and reports have suggested dugong occurrence in almost
all regions in the country, including Zambales, Manila Bay, Isabela, Quezon, Mindoro,
Romblon, Lubang Island, Bicol Region, Samar, Palawan Islands, Guimaras Strait, Panay Gulf,
North, Eastern and Southern Mindanao, and the Sulu archipelago (Kataoka et al. 1995;

Aragones, 1998; Baltazar and Yaptinchay, 1998; Marsh et al. 2002; Aragones, 2012) (Figure

2.

Dugong sightings were also reported in Northern Tafion Strait (Dolar et al. 2005), southern
Panay Island (Aragones, unpublished data), Semirara Islands, Masbate Island, Guimaras Island,
and Romblon Islands (Aragones, 2012). In 2007, dugong range was also elucidated from semi-
structured interviews (n= 593 fishers; n= 680 non-fishers) around Guimaras Island, which
suggested that the locals have a good knowledge of dugongs and thus indicate dugong-fisheries
interaction (Aragones, 2007). Additionally, Aragones at al. (unpublished data) also predicted
possible distribution in almost all islands in the Philippines based on anecdotal reports and

stranding reports from 2005-2016.

There have also been attempts to estimate the relative abundance of dugongs in different areas
of the Philippines. In Northern Palawan, a population study was conducted from 1985 to 1992
using aerial surveys. At least 4-8 dugongs were sighted in El Nido, more than 10 in Imorigue
and Shark Fin Bay, 4-8 dugong sightings in Taytay Bay and 4-5 dugongs around Calauit Island.
Busuanga. This study suggests that several dugongs occur in these areas (Pawikan Conservation

Project-Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau and DENR, 1995).

A different study was also performed in Calauit Island, Busuanga from 1989-1990. Through
simultaneous dugong monitoring using land-based survey techniques, the study suggested that

the highest relative abundance of dugongs surrounding the island was 14 (Aragones et al. 1994).


Dugong populations in Davao Gulf, southern Mindanao were also estimated in 2009 (Lucero,
2010). In this study, at least 12 dugongs were seen at one site (New Argao) and 2 dugongs were

sighted in Talicud Island (Lucero, 2010).

A different study was also performed in Calauit Island, Busuanga from 1989-1990. Through
simultaneous dugong monitoring using land-based survey techniques, the study suggested that

the highest relative abundance of dugongs surrounding the island was 14 (Aragones et al. 1994).

Dugong populations in Davao Gulf, southern Mindanao were also estimated in 2009 (Lucero,
2010). In this study, at least 12 dugongs were seen at one site (New Argao) and 2 dugongs were

sighted in Talicud Island (Lucero, 2010).

Despite these attempts, relative population estimates in most of its range in the Philippines
remains unknown (Marsh et al. 2002; Perrin et al. 2005) which means that there is still limited

population data that can be used to update its conservation status in the country.

2.4 Conservation of Dugongs in the Philippines

In the Philippines, major threats to dugongs include habitat loss and degradation, direct and
indirect taking of animals, and increasing pollution due to coastal developments (i.e., resorts)
(Aragones et al. 2012; Hines et al. 2012). This increase in coastal development is evident in the
Palawan islands which are also known to be important feeding habitats of dugongs (Hines et
al. 2012). It is therefore important to understand their seagrass habitat to be able to identify

important areas to protect for the continuous recovery of dugong populations.

Legally, dugongs in the country are protected by the Philippine Wildlife Protection and
Conservation Act of 2001 (Republic Act 9147), where killing, taking and the possession of any
parts of the protected species is prohibited (Aragones, 2012; Hines et al. 2012). They are also
considered Critically Endangered based on Section 2 (List of Threatened Fauna Species and
their Categories) of DENR Administrative Order No. 2019-09. According to experts, several
sites have been proposed to be protected mainly for dugongs, but unfortunately, have not been
established. This includes Calauit Island, Taytay Bay, and Roxas Bay in the Palawan province

(Marsh et al. 2002).


Based on available data, Marsh et al. (2002), also indicated priority sites for dugong
conservation in the Philippines that can serve as a guide in species conservation planning. These
sites include (1) Calauit Island, Busuanga, (2) Green Island Bay, Roxas, (3) Malita, Davao del
Sur, (4) Sarangani Bay, Sarangani Province, and (4) Sulu Archipelago (Marsh et al. 2002).
These priority areas, especially sites in the Palawan Islands, are considered to be the last
remaining stronghold for dugongs in the Philippines, and thus essential for the survival of

dugongs in the country (Aragones, 2012; Hines et al. 2012).

Determining the relative abundance of dugongs in these areas is therefore important to
understand the interaction of the remaining population with their environment, and to determine
how it responds to changing environmental conditions to develop effective initiatives for the
conservation of dugongs. It is also important to note that while the dugong mainly interacts
with its seagrass habitat (Marsh et al. 1982; Marsh et al. 2011), the population is also affected

with its interactions with coastal communities.

2.5 Determining Dugong Distribution

Dugong population numbers have been estimated in 20 countries using aerial surveys (Marsh
et al. 2002; 2012). However, these conventional marine mammal survey techniques such as
aerial surveys (including ship surveys) require sophisticated equipment, and therefore too costly
to study (Aragones et al. 1997). This is one of the reasons why obtaining population estimates
of long-lived and wide-ranging marine mammals like the dugong across large spatio-temporal
scales is a challenge especially in developing countries such as the Philippines (Schipper et al.

2008; O’shea and Odell, 2008; Lotze and Woem, 2009; Aragones, 1996).

Different techniques appropriate for surveying marine mammals in developing countries are
however emerging. This includes conducting interviews, land-based surveys. and carcass
analysis (Aragones et al. 1997). Interviews have already been widely used in obtaining

occupancy and distribution of species in different countries such as Papua New Guinea,


Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vanuatu (Aragones et al. 1997). Moreover, surveys were also used
as a basis to design a land-based monitoring program at Calauit Island, Philippines (Aragones

et al. 1997).

In land-based survey techniques, it is important to note that the entire population is not
enumerated by the survey like other survey techniques (i.e., aerial surveys) because of
“visibility bias”. Land-based observers may potentially miss animals because of fatigue,
weather conditions, and the general difficulty to sight the animal from the observer’s vantage
point. For example, the animal might blend into the surroundings or may be too far to sight
from the observer’s point of view (Pollock and Kendall, 1987; Aragones et al. 2012b). This
means that different factors should therefore be considered, including good weather conditions,
availability of elevated platform i-e., hilltops, cliffs, buildings, watchtower, and the density of
stations, in designing a land-based monitoring program. As such, the survey technique has been
used to monitor marine mammal species with nearshore distribution (Aragones et al. 1997;

Krogman et al. 1989; Rugh et al. 1990).

Krogman et al. (1989) used land-based surveys to estimate the abundance of migrating
Bowhead whales in Alaska. Population of Gray whales were also monitored in California using
this technique (Rugh et al. 1990). Moreover, Giacoma et al. (2013) also suggested that land-
based surveys are indeed a useful tool for managing marine species within a coastal protected
area since animal movements, their interactions with anthropogenic elements and group

dynamics can be seen clearly from a good vantage point on land (Giacoma et al. 2013).

Since dugongs are considered coastal marine mammals, land-based surveys have already been
used to relatively estimate their population in different areas in the Philippines. In Calauit
Island, a simultaneous land-based monitoring program was done from 8 different vantage
points in Calauit Island in 1990 (Aragones, 1994). In 2017, 13 additional stations were
identified which includes stations in the two nearby islands Dimipac and Maltanobon resulting

to 21 monitoring stations. Seven more were added in 2018 resulting to a total of 28 stations


which further increased the survey coverage around the three islands(Aragones, unpublished

data). (Figure 3).

Similarly, relative abundance of dugongs was also estimated in Davao Gulf from an elevated
facility in the shoreline wherein observations were also done simultaneously from 3 monitoring
stations (Lucero, 2010). This technique in assessing the spatial distribution of dugongs is
therefore proven to be viable in developing countries given the different factors that need to be
considered such as the availability of elevated vantage points near the shore that could provide

a good field of view during species monitoring.

2.6 Assessing habitat and space-use patterns

A habitat is an area that allows the occupancy, survival and reproduction of a given organism
and is assessed based on physiographic conditions and the availability of resources. (e.g.,
shelter, food, water, temperature) (Hall et al. 1997; Moraes-Arraut et al. 2012). Dugong home
ranges which reflect the area used by the animal, have been widely studied in Australia with
home range for individual dugongs estimated using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) revealing,
KDE home ranges (95% isopleths) varying from 0.5 to 733 km² (Sheppard et al. 2006), while

De longh et al. (1998) recorded a mean home range (95%KDE) of 43 km² and core area


(50%KDE) of 4km² in Indonesia. The largest reported dugong home ranges (95% KDE) are
those in Torres Strait between Australia and Papua New Guinea (Deutsch et al. 2022) ranging
from 264-1358 km² based on six individually tagged dugongs and were mostly located in deep
waters (5-15 m depth). According to Deutsch et al. (2022) Torres Strait has a large area of
seagrass including more than 13,000 km² of deep-water seagrass which could potentially
explain the large home range. In contrast, smaller and fragmented seagrass areas along the
Queensland coast have resulted to a smaller home range size (Gredzens et al. 2014; Deutsch et
al. 2022). Habitat topography (depth of key habitats, presence of reefs, and overall
characteristics of seagrass beds) could therefore lead to space use variations across regions

(Gredzens et al. 2014).

The influence of physical factors such as winds and tides on home ranges have also been studied
(Nietschmann and Nietschmann 1981; Nietschmann, 1984) revealing that local distribution and
movement patterns of dugongs vary accordingly to avoid rough sea conditions (Nietschmann,
1984; Marsh et al. 2011). In fact, it was found that there is a seasonal shift in core areas used
by dugongs in Australia, spearing the summer and winter pattern (Holley, 2006). In addition,
according to Deutsch et al. (2022), individual sirenians have also generally exhibited a
characteristic of strong site fidelity to one or a small number of highly used core areas within

their home range in a particular season.

According to Moraes-Arraut et al. (2012), dugongs generally prefer (a) shallow to medium deep
waters (usually between 0.5-60m), (b) warm waters with a minimum temperature of 17 degrees
Celsius, (c) seagrass beds that contains their species preference, and (d) sites such as shallow
bays that can protect them from rough seas and sharks during calving. All these factors govern
species distribution, movement and abundance. With seagrass cover declining in the last 50
years by 30 to 40% (Fortes, 2013), it is therefore important to determine important feeding
grounds, and to understand how it utilizes a specific site (i.e., feeding and calving site) to help
in identifying important dugong areas which will be recommended for inclusion in management

plans.

Figure 4. Methodological framework of the study

The daylight habitat use patterns of dugongs was examined through the conduct of

simultaneous land-based surveys, direct dugong observations, habitat assessment and

validation, and fishers’ perception survey. Land-based surveys were employed to infer the size

and locations of confirmed daylight space use area (CDSU) and confirmed daylight core area

(CDCA) of dugongs in Calauit Island. It was conducted in May, June, October, and November

2019 to infer the potential variation of CDSU and CDCA. On the other hand, direct dugong

observations were conducted in select monitoring platforms outside of the survey period to



provide additional information on dugongs and support monitoring data. Moreover, habitat
assessment and validation was done to investigate physical and biological characteristics of
these important locations such as depth, and bottom type to further characterize CDSU and
CDCA. Lastly, fishers’ perception survey aimed to determine the perceptions of fishers on
dugongs on important locations. Ultimately, these insights on the daylight habitat use of

dugongs could inform the conservation management of dugongs around the island (Figure 4).

3.2 Limitations of the study

Land-based surveys were only conducted during the day, from sunrise to sunset. No surveys
were conducted at night, thereby results only represent daytime ranges referred to as daylight
habitat use areas in this study. In addition, seasonal variation was assessed only based on two
sampling periods reflecting pre-monsoon conditions in 2019 —during the mid-year in May and
June. and in the latter part of the year in October and November. Moreover, direct dugong
observations were recorded in sites where locals perceive to be frequented by dugongs, and
conducted opportunistically during excellent water clarity which provides a clear view of the
individuals observed. Further, in the habitat assessment and validation, due to the extent of the
study area, only spot validation surveys at different random points around identified daylight
habitat use areas were done to examine the substrate. Lastly, the fishers perception survey did

not account the variability in visitation rates of fishers in different fishing locations.

3.3 Study area

The study area is in Northern Busuanga, Palawan, Philippines in the West Philippine Sea,
covering three islands: Calauit Island, Dimipac Island, and Maltanobon Island. Historically,
these areas are known to have reported sightings of dugongs with at least two dugongs
frequently seen named Pingas and Aban, named after Sitio Aban-aban which is the only site
utilized for dugong watching in the Philippines. Dugong watching in Calauit Island was

established as a community-based ecotourism in March 2017 following a series of consultations


with members of the Indigenous Peoples community, tour operators, representatives from the

Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and C3 Philippines (Veghel, 2018).

Calauit Island is also known to be one of the last remaining strongholds for dugongs in the
Philippines which makes it a priority site for dugong conservation (Aragones, 2012; Hines et

al. 2012; Marsh et al. 2002) (Figure 2).

Manlag and Dimipac.

The area is composed of small island ecosystems characterized by clear and shallow waters.
Landforms include plains, hills and valleys with the highest island elevation of 130 meters. All
three islands are part of the ancestral domain of the Nurunutan Tagabanwa tung Calawit may
Quezon (NTCQ) by virtue of their approved Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) in
2010. Barangay health workers in Calauit island indicated a total population of 1,362 in 2017

(Onwesen interview, 2017). At the time of this study, latest documents from the health centers


suggested that there is a total of 304 households in Calauit located in 6 clusters- Proper, Aban-

aban, Binalayan, Cadyes, Manlag and Dimipac, with fishing as a primary source of livelihood.

The entire island of Busuanga, including Calauit is under the Type 1 modified Coronas
climate classification. This climate type has two distinct seasons: dry from November to April

and wet for the rest of the year.
3.4 Data gathering
3.4.1 Simultaneous land-based surveys

A land-based survey technique was adapted from Aragones (1994) wherein monitoring was
done from 8, 21, and 28 different vantage points around the island in 1990, 2017, and 2018,
respectively (Aragones et al., unpublished data). The stations were carefully chosen and were
situated in coastal hills and/or tall trees that could provide a better view and wider coverage to
monitor dugong presence. This study expanded the survey area by adding four additional
monitoring stations resulting to a total of 32 monitoring stations in 2019. Among these stations,
27 stations are situated in Calauit Island, and 5 stations in nearby islands (herein referred to as
offshore islands). Among the 27 stations in Calauit, there were 8, 8, and 11 coastal locations in
the north, east and west coastal locations, respectively, which were classified according to the
influence of winds or monsoons in the stations (Figure 6). For example, while Kiling-kiling
station appears to be in the northern section of the island, the station is more exposed to the
western winds similar to other monitoring stations on the western side of the island. Among the
5 stations in the offshore islands, there were 3 stations in Dimipac and 2 stations in Maltanobon

Island (Figure 6). Binoculars were also used to increase the detection rate.

Figure 6. Map showing location of the monitoring stations in Calauit Island, Busuanga.

To assist citizen scientists in estimating the sighting distance, at least two predetermined
reference points such as buoys were installed in each monitoring station. The sighting distance
between the monitoring platform and each reference point was determined using a rangefinder
and was included in the gridded map in the monitoring data sheet. For example, in Maltanobon

2 monitoring station, there were three reference points with known sighting distance 208m,


250m, and 300m (Figure 7). Figure 8 shows a photo of the buoy with a known sighting distance
of 208m and a sighting of a mother and calf. Observers will then use the reference point to

estimate the sighting distance and sighting location in the gridded map.

Figure 7. Maltanobon 2 sighting map with reference points and distance indicated to serve as

a guide.

The survey was conducted for two (2) consecutive days from sunrise to sunset (6:00 — 18:00),
in each monitoring period. Primary data collected included the frequency of dugong sightings,
sighting distance, time of initial and last sighting, and presence/absence of calf. Sighting data
was based on the same individual or pair which were singly observed. Environmental
conditions during the survey, including Beaufort sea state (0-4), cloud cover (0-8), glare (low,
medium high) and water clarity (poor, good, very good) were also recorded every hour (Figure

9).


Figure 8. Field of view of Maltanobon 2 monitoring station showing buoy with 208-m

sighting distance.

To improve data due to perception bias -the bias due to animal presence but not seen, some
stations overlap (Aragones et al. 2012b). Monitoring was also done simultaneously at multiple
locations to reduce the double counting of animals. Moreover, multiple observers (at least 2)
were present at each station to reduce visibility bias and increase the detection rate of potentially

missed animals.

This method employed a citizen science approach wherein volunteers were recruited from the
community. All volunteers were trained prior to the survey to ensure that all methods employed

were standardized. Training included how to use binoculars, how to estimate distance, and how


to fill out the monitoring form. A total of 106 trained local citizen scientists participated in the
simultaneous dugong monitoring program in 2019. These volunteers spent a total of 24

volunteer hours per monitoring period.

To assess the seasonal variation of sightings, monitoring was done in multiple months: (a) May.
(b) June, (c) October, and (d) November. The October and November fall in the lull period
before the northeast monsoon. The sampling period was defined based on the local climatic
conditions in Calauit characterized by better survey conditions in the island during pre-

monsoon. The May and June sampling period was conducted before the southwest monsoon


affecting Calauit in the middle part of the year, while the October and November sampling
period was conducted before the northeast monsoon affecting Calauit in the latter part of the

year (Table 3).

3.4.2 Direct dugong observations

To complement the land based monitoring data, direct dugong observations on areas perceived
to be frequented by dugongs were also conducted from monitoring platforms in Aban-aban,
Dimipac 2, Maltanobon 2, and Elhan during April, May and June outside of the land based
survey period. Dugongs were observed opportunistically during good to excellent water clarity
while taking note of their behavior, dive times, and surfacing interval. A dive time is defined
as the time a dugong spends below water (the time from when a dugong dives to the time it re-

surfaces). A surfacing interval is the time a dugong spends above water.

3.4.3 Habitat assessment and validation
Depth

Rapid habitat assessments were done including determining the bathymetry/depth in survey
areas using the SDE-28S south single beam echosounder. Below are the specifications of the

equipment used (Table 4).
Table 4. Specifications of the SDE-28S South single beam echosounder.

Data acquisition using the echosounder was done following a zig-zag path to determine the

variability of depth from the coast and perpendicular to the shore across the study areas (Figure

10). Time and depth were recorded, while automatic track logging of the GPS (Garmin Montana

680) was used to record the location with respect to time. To account for the variability of tides,

echosounder depth data was corrected by subtracting the mean tide level obtained from

Wxtide32. All tide-corrected data were interpolated using the Natural neighbor technique in

ArcGIS 10.1 to produce a raster data set of the depth in survey areas.

A pre-existing resource map was obtained from the Environmentally Critical Areas Network
(ECAN) Resource Management Plan of the Municipality of Busuanga (2017-2022) for
examination. This map was digitized and georeferenced to identify the extent of seagrass

habitats in Northern Busuanga (Figure 11).

Spot validation surveys were conducted at different random points around survey areas. Garmin
GPS equipment was used to determine the location of each random point. A 0.5 x 0.5 meter
quadrat was deployed along with a go-pro in each random point to check for the substrate. The
depth was estimated using the rope attached to the quadrat. This rapid procedure was done to
increase the number of random points to be surveyed in each area. For each photo obtained,
type of substrate, the presence of seagrass species (Halophila sp., Halodule sp., Syringodium
sp., Cymodocea sp., Enhalus sp.) as well as the dominant species in each quadrat were noted.

Seagrass cover was estimated using the SeagrassWatch methodology (McKenzie et al. 2003).


When available, a grab sampler and a Trident underwater drone were also deployed to rapidly

check the substrate.

3.4.4 Fisher Perception Survey on Dugongs

Face-to-face interviews were done to collect information about the respondents’ perception of
the dugong population in Calauit Island, including frequency of dugong sightings, when
dugongs were last seen, perceived dugong count and perceived important dugong areas. Fisher-
related questions were also asked including main gear, target fish, and location of fishing
activities. A two-stage sampling method was used wherein villages with a significant number
of households were targeted followed by the snowball sampling of fishers. A total of 58 fishers
were interviewed which belonged to 4 out of the 6 residential clusters in Sitio Calauit, which
comprises 19.08% of the total number of households (Table 5). At the time of the survey. there
was no data available on the estimated population in Calauit Island, and therefore the number
of households were used as proxy information to estimate the coverage of the survey, using the
assumption of one respondent per household. Variability in visitation rates of fishers in various

areas vary and not accounted by the survey.

3.5 Data analysis
3.5.1 Data pre-processing

The sighting records that were obtained from the simultaneous dugong monitoring were
prepared for data analysis. A sighting is defined as an event an individual is seen within a certain
time duration. Based on the recorded average dive time (5 minutes and 41 seconds, n=21) for
dugongs in Calauit during the surveys, an individual sighted after a six (6) minute interval from
the time of last sighting was considered another sighting event. Sighting events during poor
environmental conditions were omitted for data analysis. These included sighting events when

water clarity was poor and when glare was high.

3.5.2 Spatial distribution of sightings

A general overview of the variability of sightings was determined by assessing the frequency

of sightings and the mean duration of sightings per monitoring period.

To assess the spatial distribution, the frequency, group size, sighting duration, water depth and
sighting distance were determined for each monitoring station. Similarly, dugong calf sightings

were also assessed in each monitoring station. Sighting maps were created using ArcGIS 10.1.

Sightings were divided into spatial groups: East Calauit, North Calauit, West Calauit, and
offshore islands (Dimipac and Maltanobon) to further assess spatial variability. This was based
on the initial assessment that these areas are unique based on topography and the influence of
monsoons and prevailing winds in each cluster. The west coast has more coralline with
extensive fringing reefs. The east shores with less extensive fringing reefs and sudden drop-off.
The northern coast has more sandy bottoms with subtidal seagrass beds. The offshore islands
are the smaller islands adjacent to Calauit and also covered by the ancestral domain title

awarded to the NTCQ.


3.5.3 Space use examination

The Geospatial modeling environment (GME) along with R-studio and ARC GIS Ver. 10.1
were used for home range creation and analysis. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) (Augliere,
2012; Quinton, 2016), a non-parametric analysis wherein a kernel is known as the probability
density, was used to estimate the activity space of dugongs around the Calauit Island Group.
According to Deutsch et al. (2022), KDE is the most widely used technique to identify
individual dugong space use. KDE techniques have been used to estimate home ranges of
dugongs (Sheppard et al. 2010), Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Parra, 2006), and Hector’s
dolphins (Rayment et al. 2010), among others. The home range defined by KDE refers to the
likelihood of finding an animal at any given point within the home range (Seaman and Powell,
1996). It produces a probability surface known as the utilization distribution (UD) which aims
to provide an indication of the area's intensity of use (Urian et al. 2009; Seaman and Powell,
1996). The unit of relative density estimates produced using the KDE method is number of

dugongs/km².

All kernels were calculated using the least squares cross validation (LSCV) method, a
smoothing function determined to estimate the least biased smoothing factor (Sheppard et al.

2006), which allowed the creation of isopleth contours with a 100m? cell size.

A 95% KDE (density contour) describes the home-range, or the entire area used by the animal,
hereinto referred as CDSU, while the 50% KDE (density contour) represents the core area
(Hooge et al. 1999; Sheppard et al. 2006; Getz and Wilmers, 2004; Urian et al. 2009), hereinto
referred as CDCA. According to Burt (1943), the areas visited outside the identified 95%

contour may be considered exploratory in nature.

Several studies noted that home ranges are appropriately referred to as a 95% UD or activity
space over a tracking period considering that survey durations are typically short to characterize
an individual’s true home range (Deutsch et al. 2022; Preen 1992; Campbell et al. 2010; Cleguer

et al. 2020b).


The total area of the CDSU and CDCA was calculated using the Calculate Geometry function
while the mean depth was calculated using the Zonal statistics spatial analyst tool in ArcGIS
using the bathymetry raster data that was previously generated. Furthermore, KDE Ratio
(50%/95%), the ratio of the 50% to 95% KDE was calculated to determine the proportional size

of core area within its home range.


CHAPTER 4
RESULTS

4.1 Spatial Distribution of Sightings

We collected data in 4 monitoring periods in 2019 (2 days each), corresponding to 95 monitored
hours resulting in 365 sightings from 30-32 monitoring stations situated across the Calauit
Island Group (Table 6; Figure 12). Sighting data with the best environmental conditions (Glare=
Low or Medium; Water Quality= Good or Excellent) resulted in 279 sighting records (Table
7). This group of records were used in all analyses to increase the confidence level in the data
gathered. Data derived during poor environmental conditions (Glare = Poor; Water Quality =

Poor) were excluded in the study.

4.2 Spatial analyses

4.2.1 All dugongs

Dugong sightings were more frequent in North Calauit followed by East Calauit. However,
largest group size was observed in the offshore islands with 6 individuals sighted and with a
mean duration of 19.8 minutes. The mean water depth of sightings in offshore islands were also

the largest and have the lowest mean sighting distance of 252.4 m.

In East Calauit, the highest number of individuals (n=4) sighted simultaneously was recorded
in October. Mean sighting duration in June was 21.1 min and 15.4 min in May. In North Calauit,
the number of sightings was highest in June with the greatest number of individuals sighted
simultaneously occurred in May and October (n=2). The sighting duration was highest in

October (35.2 min) and lowest in November (2.1 min).

In West Calauit, sightings were highest in May and lowest in June and November, with the

highest mean sighting duration in November (52.1 min).

In the offshore islands (Dimipac and Maltanobon Island), sightings were highest in May and
June, with the greatest number of individuals sighted simultaneously (n=6) also in May and

June. Mean sighting duration was highest in June (26.1 min) and lowest in October (6.5 min).

4.2.2 Calf Sightings

Dugong calves were seen at 14 monitoring stations which ranges from 1-6 sighting records,
and 1-3 calf per sighting (Figure 17; Table 11). Calf sighting frequency were highest at Cheey
cheey 1, Dimipac 2 and Elhan | (n=6). The greatest number of calves sighted simultaneously
were in Dimipac 2 and Maltanobon | monitoring station (n=3 calves). Calf sighting duration
was highest at Maltanobon | (duration=38.7 min), Cheey cheey | (duration = 25.1 min) and
Dimipac 2 (duration=19.7 min). Mean water depth where calves were sighted ranges from 0.7

m to 41.4 m with individuals sighted within 25 m to 500 m.


Calf sightings were more frequent in East Calauit (n=21) while the greatest mean group size
(4.7) and number of individuals sighted simultaneously was at off-shore islands (n=3) (Table

12). Mean sighting duration was also highest in offshore islands (22.7 min).

4.3 Direct Dugong Observations

Twenty one (21) records of dive times in Aban-aban (n=5), Dimipac 2 (n=3), Maltanobon 2

(n=8), and Elhan (n=5) resulted to an average dive time of 5 minutes and 41 seconds while

11 records of surfacing interval in Aban-aban (n=5), Maltanobon 2 (n=4) and Elhan (n=2) had

an average of 1 minute and 46 seconds.


4.4 Confirmed Daylight Space-use (CDSU) of Dugongs
4.4.1 Overview of dugong CDSU

The total CDSU (95% KDE) for the dugong population was 4.6 km² and ranged from 0.7 km²
to 1.4 km² in each of the clusters. CDCA (50%KDE) ranged between 0.1 km² to 0.2 km² in
each of the clusters with a total area of 0.7 km² in Calauit Island which represents 15.2% of
the total CDSU (Table 13; Figs. 20,21). The CDSU and CDCA of dugongs appears to be
dispersed across the three islands with CDCA in Dimipac 2 located offshore characterized

with a high kernel density.

On the other hand, the total CDSU (95% KDE) for the dugong calf population ranged
between 0.4 km² to 1.0 km² with a total area of 2.7 km². CDCA (50% KDE) ranged between
0.1 km²to 0.2 km² in each of the clusters with a total area of 0.3 km² which represents 11.1%

of the total CDSU (Table 13; Figs. 22).

The CDSU locations of calves were found in the east, southwest, southeast, north, and in the
offshore islands, while CDCAs were identified in the east (Punta and Cheey cheey), west

(Binalayan and Cadyes), and offshore (Dimipac and Maltanobon).

The east cluster appeared to have the highest CDSU for both dugongs (1.4 km²) and calves
(1.0 km²). Moreover, results show that the KDE ratio for both dugongs (28.6%) and calves

(25%) was highest in the offshore islands.

4.4.2 Seasonal Variation of Dugong Home ranges

The total CDSU (95%KDE) of the dugong population in May-Jun ranged between 0.6 - 1.0
km’ in each of the clusters with a total home range size of 3.2 km². Total CDCA (50%KDE)
ranged between 0.1- 0.2 km² among clusters with a total of 0.4 km’ that represented 12.5% of
the total CDSU (Table 14; Figs. 23-24). In Oct-Nov, total CDSU ranged between 0.4 to 1.9 km²
with a total area of 4.9 km² while the total CDCA of 1.1 km² ranged between 0.3-0.5 km² in
each of the clusters and represented 22.4% of the total CDSU (Table 14; Figs. 23-24).

During the May-Jun sampling period, data revealed that the highest CDCA was in the off-shore cluster with 0.2
km² while the highest CDCA during the Oct-Nov sampling period was in the east with 0.5 km’. This data also
corresponds to the offshore cluster having the highest proportion of core area as shown by the KDE ratio during
the May-Jun sampling period (33.33%) while the KDE ratio was highest in the eastern cluster (26.3%)

during the Oct-Nov sampling period.

Out of the 128 random spot surveys, 80 sites revealed the presence of seagrass, of which 31
(38.75%) were characterized as high biomass, 38 (47.50%) were of low biomass while 11

(13.75%) were of medium biomass. Halophila sp. was present in 31 (38.75%) out of the 80
sites. Among these, significant seagrass beds with Halophila sp. was observed in core areas

Aban-Aban and Elhan and Kawiren (Figure 32). Other seagrass species observed include


Halodule sp., Syringodium sp., Cymodocea sp., and Enhalus sp. Depths of seagrass areas
ranged between 1.5 m to 27 m, with deep-water seagrass beds (>15 m) observed in Diapnay
(17-22 m), Dimipac (24 m), Kawiren (18-20 m), Aban-aban (23-27 m) and Pagdukon (24 m).
During the spot validation surveys, one incidental sighting of a dugongs coincided with the
presence of Halophila sp. such as in Macachin at 13.5 m, while another dugong was sighted

in Cheey cheey | at 18 m depth characterized with sandy substrate.

4.5 Fishers’ Perception on Dugongs

The main fishing gears of respondents interviewed is shown in Table 18 with hook and line
having the highest percentage of 51.72%, jigger with 41.38% while gillnet fishers comprise
6.90% of the total respondents. The main target fish of these fishers are reef associated species
(74.14%) including groupers, emperors, jacks, breams, rabbitfish, and snappers, among others.
The other 25.86% of respondents considered octopus as their target fish (Table 19). Figure 34
shows the fishing intensity per gear type, while Figure 35 shows the spatial distribution of

sightings vis a vis the type of reported fishing activity.

All respondents in the perception survey stated that they “frequently’ see dugongs during their
fishing trips. When asked about the degree of frequency in the past year, a total of 52
respondents (89.66%) answered “several times” (Figure 36). All respondents also perceived to
know where dugongs regularly occur while none of the respondents have ever seen dugong
calving. Among the perceived dugong areas mentioned by respondents, Aban-aban appeared
to have the highest frequency indicated (n=25), including Kawiren (n=19), Binalayan (n=19),

Dibulok (n=16), and Dimipac (n=15) (Figure 37). Lastly, 35 respondents (60.34%) perceived

that less than 10 dugongs inhabit the important dugong areas (Figure 38). Nine respondents did

DISCUSSION
Spatial distribution of Dugong CDSU and CDCA

The dugong sighting data and confirmed daylight space use (CDSU) areas indicated that
Northern Busuanga remains an important area for dugongs in Palawan, Philippines, with
sightings across all monitoring stations and a maximum of 4 dugong mother-calf pairs and
3 adult dugongs sighted simultaneous from non-overlapping vantage points (Figure 3;
Table S1). The results suggest a minimum relative population of 11 dugongs in the area,

while the presence of at least 3 calves indicates a reproducing population.

Monitoring stations including Aban-aban (n=30), Elhan | (n=23) and Kawiren (n-16) were
found to be frequented by dugongs. This was also validated by the fishers’ perception
survey wherein Aban-aban and Kawiren had the highest frequency among the perceived
dugong areas. Aban-aban monitoring station covers the established dugong watching area
which is a community-based ecotourism operated by the indigenous community while
Kawiren is characterized with significant seagrass beds potentially utilized as a foraging

area,

Based on the analysis, the total CDSU (95% KDE) is approximately 4.6 km² spanning,
across all survey areas, while the total confirmed daylight core area (CDCA; 50%KDE) is
about 0.7 km² which represents 15.2% of the total home range. On the other hand, space
use analysis revealed a total CDSU of calves around the island of 2.7 km², and a CDCA of
0.3 km² which represents 11.1% of the total CDSU.

These types of analyses on home range such as that on bottlenose whales in Canada have
been used to infer an animal’s territory, describe foraging ecology and reveal spatio-
temporal variations in distribution and home range (Hooker et al. 2002; Richard et al.

2014). In this study, sighting distribution and space use analysis was used to infer important


dugong areas utilized which may be characterized as their feeding and nursery grounds.
While no specific calving or nursery areas have been defined in the study site historically,
identified CDCAs or core areas as defined by Dixon and Chapman (1980), are parts within
the home range that are used intensively which could suggest important foraging and

calving areas, among others.

In Australia. home range estimates for individual dugongs ranged from 0.5 to 733 km²
(Sheppard et al. 2006) while home range studies in Indonesia revealed a home range of 43
km² and a core area of 4 km² (De Iongh et al. 1998). Furthermore, the largest reported
dugong home range was observed in Torres Strait between Australia and Papua New
Guinea ranging from 264 to 1358 km² which was based on six individually tagged dugongs
(Deutsch et al. 2022). In comparison to these home ranges recorded in other countries, the
CDSU and CDCAs in the Calauit Island Group revealed by this study appears to be small.
As demonstrated by several studies, considering the complexity of movement behaviors
across several spatial scales, it is therefore probable that the confirmed daily used area of
dugongs indicated by this study could be a subset of a larger dugong space use around the
waters of the Province of Busuanga and even the larger Palawan Region (Marsh and
Rathbun 1990; De longh et al. 1998; Holley 2006; Sheppard et al. 2006; Gredzens et al.
2014; Cleguer, 2015). Nevertheless, this study support claims that Calauit Island is an

important area for dugong conservation (Marsh et al. 2002).

The offshore-islands, Dimipac and Maltanobon, had the highest KDE ratio, which means
that a major part of its home range in these areas function as a core area for dugongs. These
offshore islands also revealed to have the highest mean sighting duration among dugongs
(19.8 min), and calves (22.7 min), which means that dugongs spend time longer in these
areas. This is similar to other field studies such as on Irrawaddy dolphins in the Cambodia
and Vietnam border which has shown proximity to offshore islands (Verutes et al. 2021).
This is further supported by sighting records of three pairs of mother and calf in Dimipac


2 in May 2019 and in Maltanobon | in June 2019. The high KDE ratio coupled with dugong
sightings of larger groups in the offshore islands could then have implications on the area’s

likelihood of importance.

Space-use patterns

Movement behaviors across several spatial scales is complex. As such, the likelihood of
importance of an area could also potentially shift due to the influence of strong winds and
low tides (Nietschmann and Nietschmann 1981; Nietschmann, 1984; Holler, 2006).
Aragones (1994) also noted that the movement of dugongs can be affected by prevailing
monsoons, suggesting seasonal variation of dugong distribution within the island. In this
study, the highest number of sightings was recorded in East Calauit during the November
sampling period, while the greatest number of individuals sighted simultaneously was
recorded in the East and North Calauit during October. On the other hand, the highest mean
sighting duration was recorded in the West during November. This suggests that dugongs

stayed longer in the west during the November 2019 sampling period.

Furthermore, while CDCAs were identified around the island in the May-Jun sampling
season, analysis shows a significantly larger core area in the offshore islands during May-
Jun sampling period than in the Oct-Nov sampling period in 2019. However, despite the
the smaller core area in the offshore islands during the Oct-Nov 2019 sampling period,
analysis revealed that core areas were more dispersed around the island. KDE ratio was
also higher in Oct-Nov 2019 suggesting that during this time, the greater portion of the

CDSU was also the core area.

CDSU and CDCA of calves also appeared to be higher during Oct-Nov 2019 than in May-

Jun 2019. Further, CDSU of calves was highest in the offshore islands during May-Jun and


highest in the east cluster during the Oct-Nov sampling period. This variability in
movement behavior suggests that despite the perceived likelihood of importance of the
offshore islands, other parts of the island such as the east side are also utilized and possibly

considered important areas around the Northeast monsoon season.

This complexity of movement patterns of dugongs can also then present to be challenging
with identifying important areas, and thus, it also important to examine the sighting records
and confirmed daylight space use areas along with other sources of variability of space use
such as the site’s physical and biological characteristics (Cleguer, 2015; Aragones et al.

2006; Marsh et al. 2012; Preen, 1995).

As described above, the home range of dugongs could reflect their association with feeding
areas, of which may also vary due to depth (Hooker et al. 2002) considering that dugongs
are known to follow an optimal feeding strategy wherein their feeding site selection is
based on maximum energy gained, with minimum energy expended (Aragones et al. 2006;

Preen, 1995; Sheppard et al. 2007).

The mean depth of dugong CDSUs and CDCAs among the clusters ranged from 5.1 to 23.1
m with the offshore islands having the highest mean depth reaching up to 23.1 m.
According to related literature, dugongs are generally found in shallow areas less than 15
m but also occur on depths reaching up to 37 m (Marsh and Saafeld, 1990; Lee Long and
Coles, 1997; Lee Long et al. 1996). Keith-Diagne et al. 2022 also noted that dugongs can
be found over deep water seagrass beds in some parts of its range with dives recorded to
more than 30 m but no records beyond 40 m. In this study, seagrasses were observed up to
27 m with deep water seagrass beds at more than 15 m depth observed in Diapnay,
Kawiren, Aban-aban, Pagdukon and in Dimipac which is located offshore.

Studies suggested that dugongs feed predominantly on 12 species of seagrass while some
indicated that, Halophila ovalis and Halodule uninervis were observed to be preferred by


dugongs due to their high nitrogen content and since these are easily digestible. (Marsh et
al. 2011; Preen, 1995; Sheppard et al. 2010; Domning, 2022). In this study, 80 of 128
random points revealed the presence of seagrass, with 31 sites with the presence of
Halophila sp. Among the 31 sites, significant seagrass beds dominated by Halophila sp.
were observed in CDCAs such as Aban-aban at 7 m depth, Elhan at 10.7 m and Kawiren
at both shallow area at 1.5 m and deeper areas at about 18 m. These findings are supported
by monitoring data which revealed that Aban-aban (n=30) and Kawiren (n=16) monitoring

stations were frequented by dugongs.

Sighting records in the offshore islands were also recorded in depths ranging between | m
(located close to shore) to 41 m. While Dimipac Island which is located offshore appeared
to have a relatively low seagrass biomass, spot validation surveys revealed the presence of
Halophila sp. at 24 m depth within the CDCA. Patches of seagrass beds with Halophila
sp. was also observed outside of the CDSU areas in Aban-aban with depth reaching up to
27 m. These findings on the occurrence of deepwater seagrass beds that can be potentially
accessed by dugongs in the study area are within the depth range of documented feeding
scars which is up to 33 m (Marsh and Saafeld, 1990; Lee Long and Coles, 1997). An
incidental sighting of a dugong in Macachin at 13.5 m depth, also coincided with the
presence of Halophila sp. The Elhan (1 and 2) monitoring stations, on the other hand, had
a high frequency of sightings (n=23), and relatively long sighting duration (213 min) of 3
individuals with calf seen in the shallow area (<5 meters). In general, this area is
characterized with spur and groove reef formation, wherein coral “spurs” are separated by
narrow patches of sediment called “grooves”, which are channels potentially used by
dugongs as pathways (Aragones, 1994; Storlazzi et al., 2003). Aragones (1994) also
observed that dugongs stayed on the seaward sides of the spur and grooves in Elhan which
could complement survey results in 2019 revealing seagrass beds dominated by Halophila
sp. in the seaward side with depth reaching up to 10.7 m. This variability in seagrass depths
in the Calauit Island Group reveals that dugongs can potentially access both shallow and


deep seagrass beds. This signifies the heterogeneity of available seagrass beds for these

dugongs around the island.

Previously, Aragones (1994) had identified Pinagkiyawan as an important area noting that
it was where most dugongs were sighted simultaneously (n=14) and that despite having
the lowest seagrass biomass, it had significantly higher biomass for Halodule uninervis, a
seagrass species characterized with high nitrogen content (Marsh et al. 2011; Preen, 1995;
Sheppard et al. 2010). During the 2019 survey, eight out of the 13 dugong sightings (four
out of the eight were calves) in Pinagkiyawan happened in October, supporting
implications that dugongs potentially utilize West Calauit during the Northeast monsoon.
Dugongs sighted in Pinagkiyawan could potentially seek refuge in adjacent areas such as
Katmon where depth ranges between 2.3-11.6 m and is located in Ilultuk Bay that could

potentially provide better protection, especially for calves (Figure 6).

The space-use patterns derived from this study also complement prior distribution
knowledge based on historical land-based surveys in 2017, and 2018 (Aragones et al.
unpublished) wherein large groups were observed in Cheey cheey (4 individuals), and
Dimipac Island (5 individuals). In 2019, Cheey cheey 1 and 2 appeared to be mostly
frequented by calves with 6 to 7 sightings and also part of the east cluster monitoring,
stations that appeared to have the highest CDSU among the clusters. This could be
explained by the availability of seagrass beds with shallow patches of Halophila sp.
potentially used as nursery grounds. On the other hand, this study revealed that the largest
core area identified for calves is located in Dimipac and is characterized with seagrass beds
with the presence of Halophila sp. Based on these findings, these areas appear to have
geographical adaptations such as the combination of physical and biological characteristics

that could provide favorable conditions for dugong habitat use around the island.


Implications to Conservation Management

Studies of dugongs in New Caledonia have previously identified “ecoregions” and
attributed variability on the nature and intensity of anthropogenic influence and considered
it as a driver to explain the variability of habitat use by dugongs (Derville et al. 2022).
Similarly, dugong space use can be threatened by anthropogenic influences that could be
a factor in site fidelity, and can influence detectability of sightings (CMS, 2006). During
the 2019 survey, sighting records close to shore such as in Maltanobon Island, may be
attributable to a relatively low human induced disturbance considering that the island

remains uninhabited by people.

Poonian and Lopez (2016) revealed dugong deaths in Busuanga were attributed to
entanglement in the ropes of seaweed farms in 2013. It is however notable that while
seaweed farms were observed in Punda and Aban-aban during the survey period, there
have been no anecdotal reports of dugong mortality within the island due to seaweed
farming. Gillnet, a high impact fishing gear for dugongs due to the possibility of
entanglement, appeared to be a less prominent main fishing gear compared to hook and
line, and jigger. Nevertheless, fishing activity is almost widespread around Calauit Island
including in offshore areas based on the fishers’ perception survey. The management of
fishing related threats as well as disseminating information regarding important dugong
conservation areas to local communities could be essential in preventing dugong mortality.
Existing ecotourism activities around the Calauit Island Group such as Dugong watching
in Aban-aban and SCUBA diving in Dimipac 2 which also result to heavy boat traffic
within the area, should also further be monitored and managed considering that these same

areas were identified as CDCAs.

According to Demaster et al. 2001, long range movements also increase the risk exposure
of an animal to threats such as fishing gear entanglement which could affect the fecundity


and survival rate of the remaining dugong population. The proper management of CDSU
and CDCAs could then be useful to minimize long range movements of animals and lessen
the risk of mortality while traveling outside important areas. Other studies have shown that
animals outside their home range may also increase the probability of exposure to
chemicals that may have implications on the animal’s immune system and reproductive
performance (O’Shea and Tanabe, 2003). Considering that the identified CDSU and
CDCAs appear to be exposed to various human-induced threats, it is imperative to establish

co-management areas with local communities for effective conservation and management.

Critical evaluation of simultaneous land-based surveys using the citizen science approach

Prior distribution knowledge has indicated the presence of dugongs in the island based on
aerial surveys (1985 to 1992) and simultaneous land-based monitoring surveys (1989 to
1990, 2017, 2018). (Pawikan Conservation Project-Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau
and DENR, 1995; Aragones, 1994). According to Dunshea et al. 2020, aerial surveys have
shown that the probability of sighting was affected by environmental conditions (i.e., water
clarity) while observer-related variables (perception bias) had substantial impacts on both
duplicate sighting probabilities (dugongs vs dolphins) and the reliability of observations.
These complications in survey conditions can be minimized by using simultaneous land-
based surveys given a fixed survey area (<500m sighting distance from vantage point).
Additionally, the citizen science approach utilizes local ecological knowledge which could
enhance the reliability of observations since local observers have seen the animal multiple
times prior to the survey. This could be during their trips around the island, during transport
to and from place of residence, or during fishing activities. In this study, the majority of
sightings were also found in relatively shallow waters, in depths less than 5 meters (62.7%),
and between 5-10 meters (12.90%). Sightings in shallow water may have implications on

water clarity, and may have greater chances of being seen, as well as enhancing the


reliability in the data, eliminating errors that can be due to visual/perception bias. In aerial
surveys such as in Marsh and Sinclair (1989), 95.6% of dugong sightings were in water <5
m deep where seagrass beds were clearly visible. Moreover, dugongs were also sighted for
an extended sighting duration which may be a factor in assessing the reliability of the data.
Furthermore, while missing dugongs in groups is probable, there is also a greater
probability of missing calves during single sighting records, which could underestimate
the number of calves in the data. To address these limitations on the detectability of
sightings, the “visibility bias” as described in Pollock and Kendall (1987) and Aragones et
al. (2012), was minimized by analyzing data with the best environmental conditions,
therefore mimicking optimum weather conditions to detect an animal from each vantage

point. This implies that data from this survey technique is a conservative approach.

The conduct of land-based surveys is also limited by the availability of elevated monitoring
platforms that can provide a good vantage point to at least minimize the perception and
observer bias than can affect the level of confidence in the data gathered. Observer bias
can be enhanced through continuous monitoring of dugongs. Aragones (1994) also
acknowledged the potential bias in dugong sightings driven by uneven distribution of
vantage points within the island, which can be addressed by increasing the number of
monitoring sites and survey areas. While Aragones (1994) identified Pinagkiyawan as an
important feeding area of dugongs with a high biomass of Halodule uninervis, which in
2019 was also identified as part of the home range, the improvement of the methodological
technique by adding monitoring stations around the island have revealed other key habitats

for dugongs.

Despite the limitations of the methodology, this research study has nevertheless
demonstrated that the citizen science approach is a strategic tool that can be used to gather
important baseline data to inform dugong management and at the same time educating

local communities on the importance of conserving coastal species such as dugongs.


SUMMARY

The CDSU of dugongs is approximately 4.6 km² with CDCA of about 0.7 km’, while
CDSU of calves was 2.7 km² with CDCA of 0.3 km7. In terms of important locations, the
study revealed that the CDSU of dugongs including calves was highest in the east and
revealed the importance of the offshore islands as shown with a high KDE ratio. The May-
Jun sampling period highlighted the importance of the offshore islands characterized with
the highest CDCA and highest CDSU of calves. Further, the Oct-Nov sampling period
highlighted the importance of the east side of the island which revealed to have the highest
CDSU and CDCA for both dugongs and calves during this period in 2019. This
demonstrated that the space use areas of mother and calves varied seasonally implying that

there is potential seasonal variability of nursery grounds in the Calauit Island Group.

The study also revealed that the daylight space use areas of dugongs ranged between 5.1-
22.5 m with the highest mean depth in the offshore islands. Furthermore, in the east part
of the island, which was revealed to be an important area, CDSU of calves were
characterized with depth ranging from 1.4-15.5 m covering shallow areas of Punta, and
both shallow and deeper areas of Cheey cheey and Diapnay. These depth ranges of dugong
habitat use were supported by spot validation revealing the presence of shallow and deep
seagrass beds between 1.5-27 m. These seagrass beds were characterized with a sandy
substrate, with specific seagrasses found at more than 15m depth in Diapnay, Kawiren,
Aban-aban, Pagdukon and Dimipac. The study also found the presence of halophila in 31
out of the 80 sites, with significant seagrass beds dominated by Halophila sp. in Aban-
aban, Elhan and Kawiren. Lastly, perception surveys validated important dugong areas

including Aban-aban and Kawiren.


CONCLUSIONS

Northern Busuanga remains an important stronghold for dugongs in the Philippines. This
was demonstrated with sighting occurrences throughout the islands in each monitoring
period, with mother and calf pairs sighted simultaneously. The presence of calves that
intensively use core areas in the east and the offshore islands indicates a reproducing
population and demonstrates the importance of these areas as nursery grounds. Moreover,
the variability of sightings across sampling periods demonstrated by differences in
confirmed daylight habitat use areas between May-Jun and Oct-Nov 2019 implies the
importance of other areas such as in the east and west part of Calauit Island. However,
questions remain about absolute population size and their whereabouts during the night.
Furthermore, observations of both shallow and deep-water seagrass patches off the coast
of Kawiren, Aban-aban, Pagdukon and Dimipac indicate the potential spatial heterogeneity

of foraging habitats, given the availability of both intertidal and subtidal seagrass beds.

The extent of dugong movements in the larger Busuanga Island, outside of the study area
also remains to be seen. Nevertheless, considering that other studies have shown that
individual sirenians also tend to have a strong site fidelity, the Calauit Island Group, could
potentially be considered as a highly used core area within their home range in a regional
scale. The proper management of identified important dugong areas could therefore be

useful since these areas are also subjected to different anthropogenic threats.

Moreover, the study demonstrated that improving the land-based survey technique by
increasing the survey coverage resulted to broader observations on the habitat use of
dugongs. This study has also shown that citizen science coupled with systematic surveys
is an important strategy towards the continuous monitoring of dugongs in localized

populations in Northern Busuanga.


Ultimately, to inform the conservation management of dugongs in the Calauit Island
Group, the study recommends that the confirmed daylight space use area of dugongs
(CDSU) of approximately 4.6km² be established as Dugong Conservation Areas wherein
all activities should be managed, for example, the use fishing gears and navigational lanes,
as well as regulating boat speed. Further, the study recommends that the core area or CDCA
of approximately 0.7km² be established as no-touch zones wherein no human activities

should take place.


RECOMMENDATIONS

A long-term monitoring of dugongs should be done in collaboration with the Indigenous
Peoples community to ensure the effective management of important areas. In addition,
conducting a comprehensive analysis of seagrass habitats around the island is
recommended which include the determination of species biomass (i.e Halophila sp. and
Halodule sp.), as well as in-depth investigation of dugong-seagrass interaction. Further
examination of anthropogenic threats from fishing and ecotourism activities vis a vis
important dugong areas, is also highly recommended. Lastly, the expansion of study area
to include mainland Busuanga would allow a better understanding of the movement

patterns of dugongs in a larger scale.
