ABSTRACT

Investigation of the terahertz emission mechanism in semi-insulating and
low-temperature grown gallium arsenide at above- and below-band gap

We studied the terahertz (THz) emission carrier dynamics of semi-insulating (SI)
and low-temperature grown (LT) gallium arsenide (GaAs) photoconductive antenna
(PCA) devices photoexcited at above- (A = 780nm, E, = 1.59eV) and below-
(A = 1.55 ym, E, = 0.80eV) bandgap via THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS).
The excitation power dependence of the THz emission was determined. Moreover, we
analyzed the experimental results through an equivalent circuit model (ECM) which
accounts for the (i) photogeneration, (ii) screening effects, and (iii) transport of car-
riers of the PCA. In modeling the THz mechanism at above-bandgap excitation we
used the direct bandgap excitation model which takes into account the single photon
absorption (SPA) and two photon absorption (TPA) for both PCAs. Meanwhile, at
below-bandgap we followed and modified the two-step photoabsorption via mid-gap
states model. The good fit of the numerical results with the experimental THz emis-
sion power dependence reveal that at above-bandgap excitation, combined SPA and
TPA is the primary mechanism responsible for THz emission for both PCAs. Sim-
ilarly, the model used at the below-bandgap excitation for both PCAs was able to
replicate the experimental THz emission power dependence. Hence, we conclude that
the dominant THz emission mechanism for both SI- and LT-GaAs at below-bandgap
regime is the two-step photoabsorption via mid-gap states.

Introduction

Terahertz (THz) technology has evolved remarkably over the years {15 [16] The
significant growth is mainly attributed to technological innovations leading to fabri-
cation of better THz sources/detectors and ultrafast laser systems |16] Moreover,
mode-locked fiber lasers with fundamental wavelength of 1.55 um have led to more
stable and compact THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) set-ups [7]. Although,
the lack of efficient emitters/detectors directly excited at 1.55 um has caused the up-
conversion of the laser output from 1.55 jam to 800 nm in most systems employing
fiber lasers [7] Thus, emitters/detectors that can be excited at this fundamental
wavelength should be developed to maximize and fully utilize these fiber lasers [I7]
Despite various available THz sources that can be directly excited at this wavelength
(such as InAs and InGaAs), low-temperature grown gallium arsenide LT-GaAs based
devices remain to be more efficient THz sources/detectors due to its properties apt for
ultrafast operation such as short carrier lifetime, high carrier mobility, and high volt-
age breakdown [ll [[8]. Previous works in references [0] [71 20] have shown that
below-bandgap (A = 1.55 um, E, = 0.8 eV) excitation of LT-GaAs (E, = 1.42 eV) is
feasible. In published literature, the TPA and two-step photoabsorption via mid-gap
states are the two primary THz radiation mechanisms attributed to the below-band
gap excitation of GaAs. Recent ab initio calculations, spectroscopy, and scanning
tunneling microscopy measurements revealed the existence of defects that comprise
the mid-gap states that could have facilitated the two-step photoabsorption for below-
bandgap THz emission/detection [21] [22]

1.1. Significance

1.1 Significance

Among practical applications of the THz technology are in the food and/or agri-
cultural products quality control [23], information and communication technology
(24, 25], and atmospheric pollution monitoring [26]. Hence, development of more eco-
nomic and robust THz-TDS systems is highly advantageous. This can be achieved via
lossless use of mode-locked fiber laser by employing it at its fundamental wavelength
of 1.55 zm. As established previously, the more efficient GaAs based emitters/detec-
tors can be excited at this wavelength. Though, the actual THz radiation mechanism
of SI/LT-GaAs excited at 1.55 jum is yet to be established. Hence, insights regarding
the carrier dynamics at below band-gap emission in these PCAs will be valuable in
the understanding, design, and development of better THz-TDS setup. Moreover, ex-
tensive investigation of the photocarrier dynamics and their corresponding influence
on the THz radiation characteristics warrants in-depth research if the application
of the more popular LT-GaAs as a PCA substrate material for telecommunication-

wavelength optoelectronics is to be made viable for commercialization.

1.2 Objectives

This study aims to investigate the above: (A = 780nm, E, = 1.59 eV) and below-
bandgap excitation (A = 1.55 wm, E, = 0.8eV) THz emission characteristics of SI-
GaAs and LT-GaAs. Specifically, we aim to 1) study the intensity, bandwidth, and
saturation characteristics of the THz emission, 2) compare the ultrafast carrier dynam-
ics of SI-GaAs and LT-GaAs and 3) establish a dominant THz radiation mechanism
at the two excitation conditions for both SI- and LT-GaAs.

1.3. Scope and Limitations

We modelled the PCA THz emission operation via ECM as a lumped-element circuit
wherein the circuital elements account for all the electromagnetic (EM) phenomena
upon ultrafast photoexcitation and bias voltage application. The ECM correlates the
antenna physical parameters with the THz emission.

Two main electromagnetic phenomena represent the PCA operation in this model:
the (i) photogenerated carrier dynamics and (ii) the antenna screening effect in which

two field screenings were considered, (a) the space-charge and (b) radiation field

1.3. Scope and Limitations

screenings. Moreover, the ECM assumed that the PCA gap is uniformly illuminated
and that the THz emission exclusively arises from the electrodes. Finally, we only

applied the model to small aperture (i.e. small gap width) PCAs.

Remarkable qualities of THz wave pulses are as follows: i) highly penetrating, ii)
non-ionizing, and iii) spectral fingerprinting suitability for various molecules. Due
to these properties, THz technology has innumerable commercial applications in the

fields of arts and archaeology [27], medicine [28], and security [29]

For some time, the THz wave band remained the only unexplored band in the EM
spectrum due to shortage of plausible and practical sources/detectors [Ij {15| 16)
For this reason this range of frequencies in the EM band was called the “THz gap”. Re-
cent innovations in nanotechnology and photonics have propelled the interdisciplinary
research and industrial applications of THz technology into significant knowledge and
technological feats |I6]. Moreover, the development of a more cost-effective, stable,
and compact THz-TDS systems, and efficient THz emitters and detectors have also
contributed to the consequential breakthroughs in THz research.

Semiconductor materials can be used in the THz generation and detection. Listed

in Table are some semiconductors THz sources and their corresponding bandgaps
at 300 K [Al 5]

2.2 Gallium arsenide semiconductor materials

A popular semiconductor material for THz generation and detection is the GaAs.
Figure illustrates the unit cube lattice of a pristine GaAs which is a III-V
compound semiconductor composed of gallium (Ga) and arsenic (As) [2]. A summary
of GaAs material properties is reported in reference [2]. Moreover, some general
material characteristics of GaAs is listed in Table [2].

2.2. Gallium arsenide semiconductor materials

(3)

In addition, the resistivity of GaAs bulk can range from 10~® — 10? 2 - cm where
in the practical range is 10-3 — 10° - cm [2]. Gallium arsenide is a direct band gap
semiconductor {2}. Hence, a change in energy is the only requirement in transitions

between the valence band and the conduction band [2].

Although GaAs crystal growth is controlled, it is not impervious to defects, impuri-
ties, and dislocations (Fig. {2.2(b)} [2]. The electronic properties of GaAs are affected
(either desirably or not) by such defects [2]. Specifically, we look at point defects

6

2.2. Gallium arsenide semiconductor materials

which are localized defects of atomic dimensions [2]. Examples of point defects are
as follows; antisites, intersitials, vacancies, and dopant /material growth impurities |2]
Further, these point defects are either external (intentionally introduced, e.g.: doping)
or intrinsic (defects present in the material, e.g.: vacancies) [2]. In GaAs, intrinsic
defects are observed and affect its electronic behavior {2|. Depending on the crystal
growth conditions, the nature of defect and electronic effects can be determined [2]
Over-pressure of arsenic during growth determine the concentrations of the arsenic
(Asy) and gallium (Gay) vacancies [2]. According to reference [2], the possible effects
of these defects on the electronic properties of GaAs are as follows i) neutral ii) deep
donor-like iii) deep acceptor-like.

Meanwhile, an important GaAs defect is the EL2 (deep level) which is present
in arsenic-rich melt grown materials [2] This point defect is at the middle of the
energy gap with donor-like characteristics [2] 30) 31). Further, it acts like an electron
trap and is thermally stable [2]. This point defect can convert a p-type GaAs to a

semi-insulating material {2|

2.2.1 Semi-insulating gallium arsenide

Kayali listed the requirements for SI-GaAs in providing semiconductor quality ma-
terial: i) thermal stability, ii) absence of undesirable substrate active layer interface
effects, iii) absence of degradation of active layer properties by outdiffusion of impu-
rities from substrate during thermal processing, iv) low density of crystalline defects
2.

Semi-insulating gallium arsenide is commonly used as the photoconductive sub-
strate in device fabrication of THz sources/detectors. Tani et al. reported the emis-
sion characteristics of various PCA designs based on SI-GaAs in reference {82|. The
presence of deep levels between the valence and conduction bands gives GaAs semi-
insulating properties (p = 10’ — 10° -cm) [83].

A study of the role of defects on SI-GaAs carrier dynamics is reported by Mizeikis
et al. {13}. In this study, they found that the carrier lifetime is dependendent on the
local density and ionization ratio of the EL2 (Neze ~ 1 x 10!® cm~%) centers [[3}.
Moreover, the authors observed a significant slowing down of the diffusive grating

which is attributed to the electrons and photoionized EL2 donors interaction [3].

2.2. Gallium arsenide semiconductor materials

2.2.2 Low-temperature grown gallium arsenide

Another commonly used substrate for PCA THz emitters and detectors is the low
temperature grown gallium arsenide (LT-GaAs) due to its relatively good carrier
mobility (200 — 400cm?/V -s), subpicosecond carrier lifetime (~ 0.3 ps), and high
breakdown field (~ 5 x 10° V/cm) [I] [[8]. A comprehensive study of the emission
characteristics of several LT-GaAs based PCA designs is reported by Tani et al. [52]

The LT-GaAs substrate is grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) at substrate
growth temperature (T's) range of Ts = 200°C - 460°C with a growth rate of 1um/hr
(9). This is followed by rapid thermal annealing [Ij Further, a high density (>
108 cm~3) of point defects such as As antisites (Asga), As interstitials (As,), and
Ga-related vacancies (Gay) is observed in LT-GaAs [I]. The photocarrier transport
of LT-GaAs in the THz frequency range is dominated by electrons since the electron

mobility is one order of magnitude greater than the hole mobility [I]

Point defects in LT-GaAs

Figure demonstrates the difference between the lattice of a pristine GaAs (Ts =
580°C-600°C) and defect rich GaAs. In GaAs growth, the As desorption decreases
as Ts decreases [34]. This is because at low temperatures, the As mobility is low and
the As sticking coefficient is high [34]. Due to this, there is an excess As in the grown
layer which results to (non-stoichiometric) point defects in LT-GaAs [8] 84 85). An
Asga is formed when Ga is replaced with As (As — As bond is formed). Further, Gay
the absence of Ga in a Ga — As bond. The displacement of As in the GaAs is called
the As; [7H9}.

The average densities of the defects for certain T's ranges are listed in Table [2.4]
{G9}. From the Table we see that the density of the defects significantly varies
with Ts and post-growth annealing temperature J,. Further, the carrier mobility of
LT-GaAs decreases in general in comparison with GaAs (Ts = 580°C — 600°C) with
high defect concentration [36]

Furthermore, for the annealed LT-GaAs, the Asga (0.65eV) and Gay (0.30eV)
deep level bands from the conduction and valence edge act as trapping centers. The
presence of these point defects affect the carrier lifetime. As the defect density in-

creases the carrier lifetime decreases |], [[8] 87]

When a voltage biased PCA is illuminated with light that has a photon energy
greater than the band gap of the semiconductor substrate, it acts as an electric switch.
The switch-on time, and switch-off time are a function of the laser pulse duration,
and mainly determined by the photoexcited carrier lifetime in the semiconductor
substrate, respectively [I]

Due to its simple structure, cost-effectiveness, and operation at room temperature,
the PCA is one of the most utilized and studied THz sources/detectors. In addition,
the bandwidth of a PCA is in the range of 0.1 THz to a few THz. An extensive
analysis of the PCA THz radiation generation and detection in the Drude-Lorentz
model is reported in references [38 [39]

2.3. Photoconductive antenna devices

2.3.1 Terahertz radiation emission

The PCA THz radiation generation is demonstrated in Fig. Electron-hole (e—h)
pairs are created when an optical pulse with photon energy greater than the bandgap
of the semiconductor substrate is illuminated at the PCA gap [Il [8]. These photo-
carriers are accelerated by the applied electric field (Eyias). The rapid change in the

transport photocurrent. produces the THz electromagnetic radiation (Ey).

2.3.2 Terahertz radiation detection

The PCA Evry, detection mechanism is demonstrated in Fig. (reverse of the
THz emission). When the PCA gap is illuminated with the probe pulse (optical pulse
incident on the PCA detector), e—h pairs are created. The incident Ery, field induces
a current in the antenna gap for some 7, (seminconductor substrate carrier lifetime
of the THz detector) time. According to Jepsen et al. the electric field incident upon
the PCA detector is a superposition of Gaussian beams of various frequencies [39]

For a single component, the electric field is,

E(zx,y) = Eo exp[—(z? + y*/w9)] (2.4)

where Ep is the peak electric field strength and is given by,

the THz emission of the PCAs, only the transport of electrons will be considered since

for GaAs the hole mobility is an order of magnitude lesser than that of the electron.

In Fig. we see the corresponding equivalent circuit model of the PCA THz
radiation emission. Three circuital elements in series (with an applied voltage bias)
represents the antenna components of the PCA. A time varying photoconductance
G(t) represents the photoswitch, a time-dependent voltage source V,,(t) accounts for
the space-charge field screening, and an impedance Z, (frequency-independent over
the relevant terahertz frequency range and purely resistive) describes the radiation
field screening [40]

The local voltage across the photoswitch is determined by the circuit in Fig.
(a voltage divider). After applying circuital laws, the voltage at the gap is [12| M0],

Veap(t) = Vbias — Vec(t) — Vraa(t). (2.12)

where Vbias, Vec(t), and Visa(t) are the applied bias voltage, space-charge screening

2.5.1 Above-bandgap excitation

In this thesis, we utilized the band diagram of the (SI- and LT-) GaAs at above-
bandgap excitation in references [4] AIH13] (illustrated in Fig. 2.9(a)). The pump
pulse (E > LEgisubstrate)) incident upon the PCA gap photoexcites electrons to the
bottom of the conduction band {39} In addition, the TPA effect causes the
electrons to jump from the valence band to the upper conduction band (then relaxes
to the lower conduction band). As demonstrated in Fig. the photoexcited
electrons in the lower conduction band can either transition to the mid-gap states
(trapping) then back to the valence band (recombination) or transition to the upper

states (re-excitation) [I4] The transitions described are summarized by the rate

the various key parameters and optical constants in Eq.

2.5.2 Below-bandgap excitation

Meanwhile, for both substrates excited at below-bandgap, we employed the two-step
photoabsorption via midgap states proposed by Tani et al. [10] in modeling the THz
emission. According to Bacuyag et al. [21] and Escamo et al. {22] these mid-gap
states arise from high density of EL2-like defects. As reported in reference {5], the
transition energy from valence band to mid-gap states is about 0.8 eV, hence, below-
bandgap (A = 1.55 ym) laser excitation is feasible. Following the model developed
by Tani et. al. [IO] (with modifications following the model proposed by Benjamin
et al. {4I}), Fig. illustrates the band-diagram employed for the below-bandgap
excitation of both SI- and LT-GaAs. After below-bandgap photoexcitation, electrons
are excited from valence band to mid-gap state, and then to the upper conduction
band [[0]. The electrons in the upper conduction band can either transition to the
lower conduction band (relaxation) or transition to the midgap states, and recombine
with holes in the valence band |[0]. We describe the previously detailed processes as

Methodology

This section details the methods employed in performing the study. First, we dis-
cuss the device fabrication. Then, the THz-TDS set-up utilized in the experiment is
described. Finally, the algorithm implemented in the ECM simulation is described.

3.1 Device fabrication

In this thesis we employed (one) SI-GaAs and (one) LT-GaAs PCA emitters. We
fabricated the SI-GaAs PCA sample from a (100) SI-GaAs wafer (AXT Inc.) with
a doping concentration of ~ 1 x 10'%/cm3. The PCA dimensions utilized in the
fabrication is illustrated in Fig. Furthermore, the PCA fabrication process is
demonstrated in Fig.

Sum 30 um

Figure 3.1: SI-GaAs PCA dimension utilized in the fabrication.

A standard degreasing method was performed where in the samples were soaked in
trichloroethylene, acetone, and methanol for three minutes consequently. Then, the
substrate is washed with deionized water and dried with nitrogen gas. This process
was done to remove dust or any impurity on the substrate surface. Using standard
ultra-violet (UV) photolitography techniques, a Hertzian-dipole was patterned on top
of the substrate. This was done by applying a positive resist (ma-P 1225) on top of
the SI-GaAs and spin coating it at 3000 rpm. The spincoater was utilized to obtain

19

3.1. Device fabrication

uniform photoresist (PR) coating of the surface. Using the MIDAS mask aligner (Fig.

3.3(a))), we aligned a dipole pattern and exposed the sample with UV light. The UV
exposure time was calculated via the equation,

PR,
texposure = in (3.1)

where PReose is the PR dose (as listed in the technical sheet), and Iyy is the UV

intensity. Then, we soaked it in toluene for five minutes which causes the topmost
layer of the PR coat to be brittle. We developed the pattern on the sample by soaking
it in a developer solution (mr-D 526/s) for two minutes. Before metal deposition, the
sample was oxide stripped by immersing it ina 1: 50 solution of 48% hydrofluoric acid:
deionized water. Metal contacts (Ni (25nm)/Au (85nm)) were deposited onto the
sample using the electron beam deposition method via the ULVAC e-beam/resistive
system in Fig. B.3(b)). Finally, we performed metal lift off by soaking the sample in
a PG Remover solution overnight, then continuously agitating the solution via plastic

dropper until all excess metal is lifted off.

Meanwhile, the LT-GaAs PCA sample was a commercially available butterfly
dipole PCA (Batop GMBH).

3.2 Experimental set-up

The schematic diagram for the THz-TDS utilized in this study is illustrated in Fig.
[3.4, We mounted the PCA emitters on a hyper hemispherical silicon lens to collimate
and reduce losses from the reflection and refraction of radiation at the surface-to-
air interface. The excitation source was a dual-output Menlo C-fiber femtosecond
(fs) laser (100 fs pulse width and 100 MHz repetition) with a central wavelength of
1.55 wm and a second harmonic of 780nm. We utilized a set of flip mirrors to in-
terchange the 1.55 ym and 780 nm pump beams and select the desired excitation
wavelength. Moreover, a mechanical stage delay was incorporated along the pump
beam to introduce a time delay. Photocarriers in the PCA emitter (SI/LT-GaAs)
were excited by the pump beam focused on the dipole antenna gap. The electric field
bias produced by the applied 20 V peak-to-peak, square wave AC bias accelerated the
photexcited carriers. The change in photocurrent in the emitter gave rise to the THz
pulse. We used another commercial dipole PCA which was gated by the probe beam
at a fixed 10mW power to detect the generated THz radiation. Further, the Stan-
ford Research SR510 lock-in amplifier measured the detected THz current. Finally,
the following configurations that were used in performing the measurements for both

emitters: 780 nm pump / 780 nm probe and 1.55 xm / 780 nm probe.

3.3. Numerical simulation

The equivalent circuit model (discussed in Sec. 2.4) of the PCA THz operation of
SI/LT-GaAs was simulated in Python v.3.11.2. Listed in Tables [A-3} and

(A.2| are the various parameters used in the numerical simulation of the PCA THz

emission and detection.

3.3.1 THz radiation emission

Figure [3.6] demonstrates the algorithm implemented in simulating the THz emission
of both PCAs. Physical constants and parameters (listed in [A.1| |A.3| and [A.4]) were

inputted. In this thesis we used a Gaussian intensity laser profile,

2r2 202
I(r,t) = Ip ( = et) (-#), (3.3)
We inputted Eq. [3.3] as a function definition. Next, the simultaneous ordinary dif-
ferential equations (ODE), Eqs. were coded as a single function
definition. We used the ODEINT function from the scypi.integrate library to solve
for Vgap(t), and Nnet(t) = N(t) + n(t). From here we solved for the current density
(Eq. Finally, the emitted E7y, was calculated via taking the gradient of the

current density.

3.3. Numerical simulation

In this study, we probed at how the Nyct expressions would look like depending
on the carrier dynamics of the device used. Hence, the parameters describing the

semiconductor substrate properties (7-, OTB, OBT, OBB, Tr; Me) have the most dominant

effect on the THz emission characteristics simulation results.

3.3.2. THz radiation detection

In simulating the detected THz radiation, the PCA detector carrier dynamics was
taken into consideration. The algorithm implemented for the detection of the THz
radiation is shown in Fig. First we inputted all the detector physical constants

and parameters. After solving for emitted Ery,, we inputted the detector response

function (GRF in Eg. [2.6) and computed for the current detector response. Next,
the surface conductivity in Eq. was inputted as a function definition. We multi-
plied the Ery,, Ip, and a, in frequency domain (via FFT function in numpy library
of Python). Finally, we implemented inverse FFT function from numpy library in
Python to get the detected THz radiation.

Results and Discussion

In this section we present the the THz-TDS and ECM numerical simulation results.
First, we present the measurements obtained from the THz-TDS. Then, the excitation

power dependence is discussed. Finally, we analyzed these measurements via the
ECM.

4.1 Terahertz characterstics of SI- and LT-GaAs

Figures [1 I] and {f.2| demonstrate the THz-TDS waveforms and corresponding emission
spectra of the SI-GaAs and LT-GaAs excited above- and below-bandgap, respectively.
The peak amplitude, bandwidth, and dynamic range of SI-GaAs excited at above
bandgap are 5.92nA, 2 THz, and 8 orders of magnitude, respectively. Meanwhile, at
below-bandgap excitation, the SI-GaAs peak amplitude is 0.29 THz. Furthermore, the
bandwidth and dynamic range are 2.7 THz, and 6 orders of magnitude, respectively.
Similarly, for the LT-GaAs, the peak amplitude is 26.25nA (above-bandgap), and
0.32nA (below-bandgap). Moreover, at above-bandgap excitation, the bandwidth
and dynamic range are 1.3 THz and 8 orders of magnitude, respectively. In addition,
the bandwidth is 0.8 THz, and the dynamic range 5.5 orders of magnitude at below-
bandgap excitation. We summarized these results in Table £-1]

As seen in Fig. the above-bandgap THz emission is x20 more intense than
the below-bandgap THz emission. Looking at Fig. the bandwidth at below-
bandgap excitation is broader than that of excited at above-bandgap. Moreover,
we observe a decrease in the dynamic range from the above- to the below-bandgap

excitation (from 8 to 6 orders).

Comparing the SI-GaAs and LT-GaAs THz emission characteristics, we observe a
more intense THz emission (at above- and below-bandgap excitation) from LT-GaAs.
However, we also note that when excited at below-bandgap, the THz emission of
both samples becomes comparable. Moreover, the SI-GaAs bandwidth is higher than
the LT-GaAs bandwidth (for both above- and below-bandgap excitation). This is
attributed to the higher electron mobility, fe(s1-caas) ~ 8000 cm?/Vs, of SI-GaAs as
compared to the electron mobility, “e(LT-caas) ~ 200 cm?/Vs, of LT-GaAs.

We attribute the difference in the THz emission characteristics between the above-
and below-bandgap excitation of the SI- and LT-GaAs to the difference in THz genera-
tion mechanism and efficiency. The SI-GaAs and LT-GaAs above-bandgap excitation
used a direct bandgap process. Hence, at above-bandgap excitation, the photocarrier
energy is 1.59 eV which is greater than the GaAs bandgap of 1.42 eV. Meanwhile, to
gain insights as to which THz mechanism is dominant in the below-bandgap regime

we look at THz emission excitation power dependence of both samples.

4.2 Terahertz peak power dependence

The excitation power dependence at above- and below-bandgap of SI-GaAs and LT-
GaAs are plotted in Figs. and {4.3(b)} respectively. At above-bandgap excitation

power dependence, we used the equation

where A is a constant, Jp, is the THz current, Pop, is the optical pump power exci-
tation, and Py, is the power saturation of the SI-GaAs (LT-GaAs), to fit the data.
The calculated Pyat values from the curve fit are 33 mW and 52 mW for SI-GaAs and
LT-Gads, respectively.

mechansims in which THz radiation is attributed to are the TPA, and two-step pho-
toabsorption via mid-gap states (0) {I7| [19 20). A quadratic response given by

Jon — BP. + Jaark (4.3)

where B, and Jgax are proportionality constant, and dark current, respectively,
characterizes the TPA. It is reported that the TPA contribution is negligible in
the the below-bandgap excitation since the non-linear absorption coefficient, 8 =
2.4 x 10-'cm/W), is very low [4d]. In addition, reference [20] reported that for 1
mW excitation power, the GaAs TPA absorbs merely 0.06% of the laser power [20]
Thus, given all these, we discount TPA as the dominant THz mechanism in the below-
bandgap regime. Furthermore, given that the values of n of SI-GaAs and LT-GaAs
in Table [£.2| are superlinear, but sub-quadratic, we conclude that the dominant THz
mechanism at below-bandgap excitation is the two-step photoabsorption via mid-gap

states.

In in an undoped SI-GaAs, the most abundant defect is the intrinsic deep level EL2
(mid-gap electronic level) [30, S1J. The following are the proposed EL2 components:
(Asca), (Asy), and (Gaas) [31]. Meanwhile, it is reported that LT-GaAs has several
defects such as Asga, Gags, and Gay with corresponding energy gap values close to
the EB? (E, = 0.97 eV), EL4 (E, = 0.52 eV), and EL2 (E, = 0.82 eV) [21]. Bacuyag
et al. concluded that the (Asga) is the most stable and thus the most abundant [21]
among the defects enumurated previously. This was confirmed by scanning tunneling
microscopy measurements, and ab initio calculations reported in reference [22]. Thus,
it is suggested that the Asc, defects comprise the mid-gap states that facilitated the
two-step photoabsorption process in the below-bandgap excitation [21] 22].

On the other hand, reference [49] reported that the As-precipitates density is
Na, = 10° cm3, while reference [50] reported a value of Na, = 2x 104 cm3. Regardless

of the difference, given that the N4, in SI-GaAs is several orders of magnitudes lesser

29

4.3. ECM numerical simulation results

than that of the EL2 density (Ngz2 ~ 1016 cm?), the effect of As-precipitates to
the below-bandgap SI-GaAs THz emission may be trivial. Furthermore, Chen et
al. reported that the post growth annealing affects the density of As-precipitates in
LT-GaAs [35]. In addition, reference [35] reported that there is no observable As-
precipitates in an unannealed LT-GaAs. The Na, is one order of magnitude lesser
than the density of (Asgq) defects even after annealing [35]. Hence, in the same way,
we conclude that the effect of As-precipitates in the below-bandgap THz emission of
LT-GaAs is negligible.

As a conjecture, we accredit the closeness to linearity of the below-bandgap exci-
tation power dependence (P;?) of SI-GaAs to the fact that at lower intensities Jpn
exhibits a linear growth [20]. According to Lee et al. [Id], and Ramer et al. {20}, the
TPA effects will only be significant at higher laser power intensities. Furthermore, as
reported in reference {[4], the TPA effect starts to have a more vital effect at about
~ 30 mW. The experimental curve fit calculation revealed that the power saturation
of SI-GaAs is (33 mW). Thus, for below-bandgap excitation of SI-GaAs, a value of n

close to 1 is reasonable.

4.3. ECM numerical simulation results

4.3.1 Simulated THz waveforms and corresponding spectra
of SI- and LT-GaAs

The simulated THz-TDS and corresponding FFT waveforms of the SI-GaAs and LT-
GaAs at above- and below-bandgap excitation are plotted in Figs. [1.4] and re
spectively. Qualitative inspection of the simulated waveforms and the experimental
waveforms exhibit relatively similar shapes. A summary of the simulated THz emis-
sion characteristics of the SI- and LT-GaAs excited at above- and below-bandgap is
provided in Table [1.4]

From the simulation, the THz peaks are 5.97 nA and 0.29 nA for the above- and
below-bandgap excitation of SI-GaAs, respectively. Moreover, as in the experiment
(Fig. [£-1(a))), the SI-GaAs THz current values excited at above-bandgap is x20 higher
than that of excited at below-bandgap. The simulated S]-GaAs bandwidth at below-
and above-bandgap is 3THz. Meanwhile, the simulated THz peak amplitude, and
bandwidth of LT-GaAs excited at above-bandgap are 26.54nA, and 2 THz, respec-
tively. Furthermore, the simulated results of the LT-GaAs below-bandgap excitation

30

4.3. ECM mmerical simulation results

are as follows:

that as in Fig.

the THz peak is 0.33nA, and the bandwidth is 1.8THz. We also note

1.2(a)} the simulated above-bandgap THz current values are x80 more

intense than that of the below-bandgap THz current values.

Comparing the THz characteristics of the experimental and simulated SI-GaAs and

LT-GadAs excited at above- and below-bandgap, we observe a good agreement between

the THz peak values for both samples. As for the difference between the measured and

simulated bandwidths, we attribute it to the water vapor absorption. It is reported in

31

4.3. ECM numerical simulation results

published literature that water vapor is highly-absorbing in the THz region [46] 7]
As observed in Figs. H-T(a)] and oscillations occur at t > 0. These oscillations
are caused by the water vapor absorption in free space (oscillations appear as dips in
the emission spectra) [51]. From the values reported in references {6 47], we plotted
the water vapor absorption lines in the experimental FFT (up to 5 THz) of the SI-
GaAs and LT-GaAs (for above- and below-bandgap excitation) in Figs. and
C.1(a)} respectively. Furthermore, looking at the simulated bandwidth of SI-GaAs
(Figs. and [£-4(d)), we do not observe the broadening of the bandwidth at the
below-bandgap excitation (compared to Fig. [1-1(b)). In conjecture, the broadening
of the experimental bandwidth (Fig. may be due to the escape of trapped
electrons from As-precipitates {50) 2). As previously mentioned in Sec. the

contribution to the THz emission intensity of the excited electrons trapped in the

As-precipitates is small (due to the density being several orders of magnitude lesser
than the mid-gap states), but since this process is faster (< 20 ps) as compared to the
SI-GaAs carrier capture time (50 — 100ps), it may have caused the broadening of the
bandwidth at below-bandgap excitation. Similarly, we compare the experimental and
simulated bandwidths of LT-GaAs excited at above- and below-bandgap (Figs. [£-5(b)]
and 4.5(d)). We see that at below-bandgap excitation, the measured and simulated

bandwidths decreased as compared to that of excited at above-bandgap. This decrease
in emission spectral bandwidth is caused by the long carrier capture in the mid-gap
state. Finally, for both samples the simulated dynamic range decreased from above- to

below-bandgap excitation, which is what we observed from the experimental results.

4.3.2 Simulated excitation power dependence

The simulated above- and below-bandgap excitation power dependence plots of SI-
GaAs and LT-GaAs are presented in Figs. and respectively. For both
PCA samples, we utilized the model (combined SPA and TPA) proposed in refer-
ences {[4| 4] in simulating the THz emission at above-bandgap excitation. From the
qualitative examination of the experimental and simulated results in Fig. we see
that the model was able to closely replicate the actual THz emission mechanism at
above-bandgap for both SI-GaAs and LT-GaAs. Hence, we conclude that at above-
bandgap excitation for both SI-GaAs and LT-GaAs, the combined SPA and TPA is
the dominant THz emission mechanism.

Meanwhile, the simulated excitation power dependence of the SI-GaAs and LT-
GaAs excited at below-bandgap using the two-step photoabsorption via mid-gap de-
fect states model are shown in Figs. and respectively. For both samples,
we observe that the simulated power dependence was able to replicate the experimen-
tal power dependence. The good fit between the simulated and experimental power
dependence establishes the two-step photoabsorption via mid-gap states as the dom-

inant THz emission mechanism in the below-bandgap regime for the SI-GaAs and
LT-GadAs.

Summary and Conclusion

In summary, we were able to investigate the photocarrier dynamics of SI- and LT-GaAs
optically excited at above- and below-bandgap regimes through THz-TDS set-up. For
the above-bandgap excitation of SI-GaAs the THz peak amplitude, bandwidth, and
dynamic range are 5.92nA, 2 THz, and 8 orders of magnitude, respectively. Moreover,
the THz amplitude peak is 26.25 nA, the bandwidth is 1.3 THz, and the dynamic range
is 8 orders of magnitude for the LT-GaAs excited at above-bandgap. Meanwhile,
from the below-bandgap excitation of SI-GaAs, the THz peak amplitude, bandwidth,
and dynamic range are 0.29nA, 2.7THz, and 6 orders of magnitude, respectively.
Furthermore, the THz peak amplitude is 0.32nA, the bandwidth is 0.8 THz, and the
dynamic range is 5.5 orders of magnitude for the LT-GaAs excited at below-bandgap.
From the excitation power dependence measurements at above-bandgap, we calculated
the Pa, as 33mW, and 52mW for the SI-GaAs, and LT-GadAs, respectively. The
good agreement between the experimental and simulated power dependence trend
for both SI- and LT-GadAs excited at above-bandgap reveals that the dominant THz
mechanism in this regime is the combined SPA and TPA. On the other hand, the
below-bandgap excitation power dependence revealed a power law fit of (Pot) and
(Pi!) for SI-GaAs, and LT-GaAs, respectively. This corresponds to a super-linear
power dependence described in the two-step photoabsorption process mediated by
mid-gap states. Moreover, the numerical simulation of the THz peak amplitude power
dependence was able to replicate the experimental trend. Hence, the dominant THz
emission mechanism of SI- and LT-GaAs excited at below-bandgap is the two-step

photoabsorption mediated by mid-gap states.
