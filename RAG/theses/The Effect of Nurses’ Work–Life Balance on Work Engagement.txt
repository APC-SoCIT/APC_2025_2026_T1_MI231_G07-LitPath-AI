ABSTRACT
Background   This study aimed to examine the effects 
of nurses’ work–life balance ( WLB ), job demands and 
resources, and organizational attachment on their work 
engagement (WE). The second aim was to shed light on whether the relationships among WLB , job demands, 
resources, and WE are modulated by organizational 
attachment.
Methods  In total, 425 nurses working in a university 
hospital responded to the questionnaire. The primary 
statistical analysis method was hierarchical multiple regression with WE as the dependent variable.
Results  In the model in which all variables were 
applied, affective commitment  (AC) (β = 0.41), family-
to-work positive spillover ( β = 0.25), and number of 
children ( β = 0.13) were found to have a significant 
association with WE. Family-to-work negative spillover (FWNS) and AC had significant  interaction  effects. The 
result suggests that when AC was low, WE tended to 
decline further due to FWNS ; however, when AC was 
high, WE did not change due to the effect of FWNS .
Conclusion   These results confirmed  that to improve 
nurses’ WE, hospital organizations should implement initiatives to facilitate WLB  that considers nurses’ 
household roles. Furthermore, high organizational attachment buffered the home’s negative influence on 
work, thereby helping nurses work energetically.

Work–life balance ( WLB ) refers to harmony between 
work and non-work aspects of life, and is an important 
concept for workers to continue to work healthily and for the sustainability of organizations.
1 Therefore, 
countries around the world are taking steps to promote 
WLB .2 For example, in Northern European countries, 
which have advanced WLB initiatives, national and lo -
cal governments are working to improve the infrastruc -
ture for childcare and nursing care.3 In the US, it is well 
known that companies are actively engaged in WLB  
initiatives, believing that these will lead to increased 
worker productivity.3 Since the formulation of the WLB Charter in 2007, Japan has made efforts to improve the 
WLB of working people (e.g., work style reform or the 
Premium Friday campaign).1
These initiatives for promoting WLB are necessary 
at both regular companies and medical institutions. This 
is because one of the world’s most serious problems in the medical and health fields is the shortage of nurses, 
and one of the causes of nurses leaving the workforce is 
the difficulty of balancing work and family life.
4, 5 For 
example, women make up a large percentage of nurses, 
and it is conceivable that life events, such as marriage or the birth of a child, would have a significant  impact on 
them. Furthermore, because many nurses work shifts and work both during the day and at night, balancing 
work and home life may be difficult. Studies of nurses 
indicate that difficulty balancing work and home life in-
creases the desire to leave the job.
6, 7 High job turnover 
and labour shortage due to a declining birth rate coupled 
with an ageing population have long been a concern for the nursing profession.
8 Considering  this, promoting 
WLB measures that make it easier for nurses to work is an essential task for Japan.
One important concept related to WLB  is work–
family conflict.
9 This concept refers to conflict over 
roles when a person is unable to balance their roles at work and home, and a relationship has been demon -
strated to exist between work and family conflict and 
decreased performance at work, the desire to leave a job, 
and increased instances of depression.
10 Meanwhile, in 
recent years, the positive effects of balancing work and 
family life, such as work–family facilitation and work–
family enrichment, have become apparent.11, 12 For 
instance, work–family enrichment occurs when experi -
ence in one role increases other experiences’ quality.11 Original Article Yonago Acta Medica 2021;64(3):269–281  doi: 10.33160/yam.2021.08.005

work and family enrichment and job satisfaction, physi -
cal health, and mental health.13 In other words, to study 
WLB  comprehensively, we must understand both the 
adverse effects due to difficulties balancing work and 
family, such as work–family  conflict, and the positive 
impact due to successful balancing of work and family life, such as work–family enrichment.
Recent research on occupational stress has centred 
on so-called positive mental measures, which focus on identifying and further developing the individual workers and workplace groups’ strengths. The psy -
chological concept of work engagement (WE) is at the centre of these positive mental measures. WE is defined 
as “a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind characterised by vigor, dedication, and absorption.”
14 A 
relatively large number of studies on WE among nurses have focused on the relationship between WE and work environment factors,
15, 16 and have reported that job re -
sources, which refer to supervisor support and rewards, are related to WE.
17, 18 In Japan, many studies of nurses 
have focused on the association between WE and work environment factors,
19 and the association between WE 
and subsequent factors such as intention to continue, intention to leave, and sense of well-being have also been examined.
20, 21
The importance of WLB is increasing yearly in the 
nursing profession in Japan,5 and it has been shown that 
nurses’ WLB  is related to mental health.22 However, 
few studies have focused on the relationship between WLB  and WE for nurses. Okada et al. conducted a 
cross-sectional study on female nurses using the concept of work–family spillover.
23, 24 The results show that WE 
is increased by family–work positive spillover ( FWPS ), 
which is when the fulfilment of roles at home has a posi -
tive effect on work roles.
Further, the results indicate that having multiple 
roles at work and home is vital for improving WE. Considering  the shortage of nurses in Japan,
8 every 
individual nurse needs to be actively engaged with their work and perform well. This study also focuses on how nurses balance roles at work and at home. Further, it 
uses the concept of work–family spillover to study the 
extent to which WE is impacted by the harmful effects 
of conflict between work and family roles and the posi-
tive impact of well-balanced work and family roles.
24 
Consistent  with the results from Okada et al.,23 FWPS  
is also expected to be the work–family spillover element that significantly affects WE in this study.
Hypothesis  1: The positive impact of family roles 
on work roles ( FWPS ) exhibits a significant effect on 
WE.One occupational stress model is the job demands-
resources model ( JD-R  model).
25 This model’s 
distinctive characteristic is that WE encompassed as a mediating variable between job resources and orga -
nizational  variables in the motivational  processes.  A 
concept that is representative of organizational variables in the JD-R  model is organizational commitment. 
Organizational commitment is defined as “emotional attachment to an organization characterised by sharing 
the organization’s values and goals, wanting to remain 
at the organization, and having a desire to work hard as a representative of the organization.”
26 Organizational 
commitment is widely known as an organizational vari -
able that predicts turnover.27, 28 It is also known to be 
directly related to other work-related outcome variables, such as organizational citizenship behaviour.
29, 30 As 
has been demonstrated with the JD-R  model’s motiva -
tional processes, increasing WE is thought to increase organizational commitment and form an organization’s attachment.
25, 31 Furthermore, forming an attachment 
to an organization decreases the desire to leave a job. It improves organizational citizenship behavior, and mea -
sures that increase WE are thought to benefit individual 
workers and the organizations to which they belong.
Meanwhile, even before WE was proposed, some 
research indicated that organizational commitment 
affects job involvement, which affects the opposite 
direction to the effect in the JD-R  model.
32, 33 Recently, 
Yang et al. performed a cross-sectional study on health -
care workers and found that the relationship between 
job stress factors and work performance is mediated by affective commitment,  which is the core principle of or-
ganizational commitment.
34 Therefore, as demonstrated 
with motivational processes, we can conclude that WE affects organizational commitment and conversely, organizational  commitment  affects WE. In other words, 
it is possible that when a worker forms an attachment 
to an organization, the worker will be able to engage 
with work actively. However, most recent studies follow the JD-R  model and investigate the effect of WE on 
organizational commitment,
31, 35 and there is a lack of 
research in the opposite direction, that is, on the effect of 
organizational commitment on WE. The present study investigates  the effect of organizational  commitment  on 
WE to address this.
Hypothesis  2: Organizational  commitment  exhibits 
a significant main effect towards WE.
In addition to the direct effect of organizational 
commitment on WE, this study also focuses on the adjustment effect of organizational commitment. Begley and Czajka demonstrated  that organizational 
commitment has an adjustment effect that weakens 
271Nurses’ work-life balance and work engagement
© 2021 Tottori University Medical Pressthe relationship between organizational stress and job 
dissatisfaction.36 However, like Begley and Czajka,36 
existing research on the adjustment  effect of organiza -
tional commitment has focused only on the relationship 
between stress factors and stress responses. It has not investigated  whether organizational  commitment  affects 
the relationship between WE and WLB or job resources related to WE when a positive work-related variable, such as WE, is used as a dependent variable and WLB 
or job resources related to WE are used as independent 
variables.
Mottaz indicated that organizational commitment is 
more strongly affected by intrinsic rewards, such as hap -
piness derived from work itself, than extrinsic rewards, such as salary.
37 A study on nurses that examined the 
relationship between organizational commitment and work-related behavior demonstrated a relationship between a nurse’s organizational commitment and self-development behavior. The nurse strives to work at a high level as a specialist.
38 These findings indicate 
that the sense of belonging in an organization can vary based on differences  in workers’ values regarding their 
work. In other words, nurses with strong organizational commitment derive powerful intrinsic rewards, such as happiness, from performing their work, and these 
nurses actively engage in their work. Thus, compared 
to nurses with low organizational commitment, nurses 
with high organizational commitment may place more 
value on the job resources they need to engage in their work and the positive effect of their family roles on their work roles. Based on the above, this study uses job resources and WLB as independent variables and WE as the dependent variable to investigate the adjustment effect of organizational  commitment  on the relationship  
between those factors.
Hypothesis  3: Organizational  commitment  
strengthens the relationship between job resources and 
WE.
Hypothesis  4: Organizational  commitment  
strengthens the relationship between FWPS  in WLB  
and WE.
SUBJECTS AND METODS
Participants
An anonymous  cross-sectional  questionnaire  survey 
was administered to nurses working at a university 
hospital in Japan’s Chugoku region. The participants 
were provided with envelopes containing explanatory documents and questionnaires describing the study’s purpose, personal information protection, and data 
management methods. The survey period was from 
December  2019 to January 2020. Of the 757 people who received the survey, 533 responded  (70.4% response 
rate). Of these, missing values and data with entry er -
rors were excluded. Data on nurses working in depart -
ments with five or more employees were used in the analysis to consider the influence of workplace group units, and data on nurses working in smaller numbers were excluded from the analysis. The final data used in the analysis were from 425 participants  (37 men and 
388 women). The mean age of the participants was 32.8 
years (standard deviation 8.9).
The Ethical Review Committee  of the Tottori 
University School of Medicine approved this study 
(Reference number: 19A147).
Measures
Demographic characteristics
The following items were included: age, gender, educa -
tion, marital status, number of children, care recipients 
(living together or apart), occupation, a career in the current job, employment status, managerial position, night shift in a recent month, and overtime work in a recent week.
Work–life balance
The Japanese version of the work–life  balance scale 
was used.39 This scale was developed using the concept 
of work–family spillover, which refers to the fact that situations and experiences  in one role of work/family 
also influence situations and experiences in the other function of work/family.
24 This scale also focuses on 
positive emotions and the negative emotions of burden and conflict experienced  by employing  multiple roles. 
This scale, similar to work–family  conflict, allows the 
examination of the direction of work-to-family and family-to-work influences and consists of four sub -
scales: work–family  negative spillover (WFNS ), family–
work negative spillover ( FWNS ), work–family positive 
spillover ( WFPS ), and family–work positive spillover 
(FWPS ). The work–life balance scale consists of 22 
items: 8 for WFNS , 5 for WFPS , 4 for FWNS , and 5 for 
FWPS . These items were evaluated on a 4-item scale 
(from 0 “never” to 3 “always”).
Job demands
Six items from the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire 
(BJSQ ) were used to evaluate the quantitative and 
qualitative work burden.40 These items were evaluated 
on a 4-point scale where the higher the work burden, the higher the score.
Job resources
We used job control, supervisor support, and co-worker 
272T. Fukuzaki et al.
© 2021 Tottori University Medical Presssupport, as well as job demands from the BJSQ .40 
Extrinsic rewards from the Japanese short version of the 
effort–reward  imbalance  model questionnaire  were also 
used.41 Job control, supervisor  support, and co-worker 
support consisted of three items, and extrinsic rewards 
consisted  of seven items. All items were rated on a 
4-item scale, and the higher the job control, support of supervisors and co-workers, and extrinsic rewards, the higher the score.
Work engagement
A shortened  version of the Japanese version of the 
Utrecht work engagement scale was used.42 This scale 
consists of nine items in three subscales: vigor, dedica -
tion, and absorption. Responses were requested on a 7-point scale (0 to 6), ranging from “Never” to “Always/
Every day.”
Affective commitment
The three-dimensional organizational commitment scale consists of three subscales: affective commitment, 
continuance commitment, and normative commit -
ment.
43 In this study, we used six items of the affective 
commitment scale,43 which indicates emotional attach -
ment to the organization, and asked participants to rate their responses on a 5-point scale (from 1 point “not applicable” to 5 points “fairly applicable”).
Statistical analyses
First, after calculating the fundamental statistics for each variable, differences in each variable by marital status were examined using t-test and chi-square test.
Second, Pearson’s correlation coefficients  between 
each variable were calculated.  Additionally,  as the 
questionnaires were distributed and collected at the 
departmental level, the data obtained were expected to 
have a multilevel structure, including individual and 
departmental levels. Therefore, the intraclass correlation 
coefficient  was calculated  to examine the effect of the 
departmental level.
Third, hierarchical multiple regression analyses 
were conducted  to examine the effects of demographic 
characteristics, job demands and resources, work–family spillover, and affective commitment on WE. Demographic  characteristics  were used in Step 1, job 
demands and resources in Step 2, work–family spillover in Step 3, and affective commitments  in Step 4. Then, to 
test the interaction  effects of job demands and resources 
and affective commitment and work–family spillover and affective commitment,  each interaction  was entered 
in Step 5.
44 The interactions were calculated after cen -
tring each variable on accounting for multicollinearity issues.
The analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 
Statistics version 26 and R version 4.0.0. The signifi -
cance level for all analyses was set at 5%.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics
Table 1  shows the demographics of the participants in 
the analysis. About 90% of the participants were female,  
42.4% had a spouse, and 57.6% had no spouse.
Table 2 shows the differences  in each variable by 
marital status. The group with a spouse had a higher 
age and career in the current job, a higher percentage 
of managerial positions, and a lower number of night 
shifts than the group without a spouse. They also had higher supervisor  support and higher WE and affective 
commitment. For work-life balance, WFNS  was high, 
but WFPS  and FWPS  were high as well.
The intraclass correlation, Pearson’s correlation, 
and reliability coefficients are shown in Table 3 . The 
intraclass correlation  was significantly  higher than 0.1, 
only for age and number of night shifts. All other vari-
ables were not significant  and less than 0.1. Therefore, 
we judged that the variation at the multilevel structure’s department level was small for each variable used in this study and conducted the individual-level analysis.
Pearson’s correlation coefficients showed strong 
correlations among age and length of service, WFPS , 
and FWPS . Moderate correlations were found be -
tween job demands and WFNS , WFNS , and FWNS . 
Furthermore, the relationship between FWPS  and WE, 
between WE and affective commitment, was moderate.
Although the reliability  coefficients  for extrinsic 
rewards were slightly low at 0.65, the rest of the coef -
ficients were above 0.70, considered sufficient.
Hierarchical multiple regression analysis
With WE as the dependent variable, Table 4 shows the results of entering the interaction between job demands, resources, and affective commitment in Step 5, and Table 5  shows the results of joining in the interaction 
between work–family spillover and affective commit -
ment in Step 5. The unstandardized  coefficients,  95% 
confidence intervals of unstandardized coefficients, 
standardized  coefficients,  P-values, and VIFs in the two 
tables are the values obtained when all the variables in 
Steps 1 to 5 are employed.  Considering  the multicol -
linearity problem due to the high correlation  coefficient 
between age and career in the current job in Table 3, we did not include age. Although  WFPS  and FWPS  
showed strong correlation, we judged that the problem of multicollinearity was small based on the value of VIF 
273Nurses’ work-life balance and work engagement

With WE as the dependent variable, Tables 4 
and 5 show a significant  increase in the coefficients  of 
determination in Steps 2–4 ( ΔR2) with the strongest 
effect on affective commitment  (β = 0.42, 0.41; Tables 4 and 5, respectively) followed by FWPS  (β = 0.24, 0.25)

DISCUSSION
This study aimed to examine the effects of WLB , orga -
nizational commitment, and job demands and resources 
on WE among nurses. Furthermore, we examined whether the level of organizational commitment modu -
lates the relationships between job resources and WE 
and between FWPS  and WE. Affective commitment, 
FWPS , and the number of children directly affected 
WE, respectively, concerning the extent of the impact. 
Job demands and resources did not have significant  ef-
fects on any of the variables. Additionally,  the affective 
commitment  had a moderating  effect on the association 
between support from supervisors and WE and between 
FWNS  and WE.
First, from among the four aspects of WLB , only 
FWPS showed a significant  association  with WE, thus 
supporting Hypothesis 1. These results are similar to those reported by Okada et al.
23 Second, the effect 
of FWPS  was more significant for nurses who were 
married than for those who were not married ( P < 
0.05; Table 2). This finding is similar to that reported 
by Okada et al.23 In other words, the present results

It is known that employees who are married or 
have children are very likely to use family benefit 
systems to balance work and family life.45 Further, 
improvement in WE is associated with psychological 
health, job performance and well-being.21, 46 In other 
words, it is conceivable that it may be beneficial to develop policies that consider nurses’ household roles, such as offering shorter work hours and time off for child-rearing and eldercare. This would enable nurses to work energetically and maintain their health. Their improved job performance would, in turn, contribute to the revitalization of hospital organizations.

The variables related to job resources used in the pres -
ent study pertained to control and support in the job 
demands–control–support model and extrinsic rewards from the effort–reward imbalance model.
48, 49 These 
variables are related to job resources in the conventional representative occupational stress model. These vari -

Questionnaire.50 They used them for a similar hierarchi -
cal multiple regression analysis as conducted in the present study. Therefore,  the differing results between 
these two studies could be attributed to the fact that the present study did not examine job resources as a

279Nurses’ work-life balance and work engagement
© 2021 Tottori University Medical Pressbetween organizational commitment and job satisfac -
tion, the latter is readily affected by day-to-day  events 
while the former is not.26 Organizational commit -
ment takes a relatively long time to develop, and it is 
stable. Additionally,  in nurses, affective commitment 
is associated with learning behavior and professional activities.
38, 52 In other words, when organizational 
commitment increases, nurses can consistently in a state of high WE and can work on nursing service diligently. Considering  the JD-R  model’s organizational 
attachment formation process,
25 it is conceivable that 
workplace environments with abundant job resources and where work is fulfilling invigorate employees to work energetically. Further, engaging in work with a positive attitude leads to the formation of organizational attachment. We believe that organizational attachment formation creates a virtuous circle that enables employ -
ees to work energetically consistently and sustainably.
This study demonstrated two moderating effects 
of affective commitment.  The results indicated that WE 
increased when the affective commitment was high, and there was support from supervisors. However, 
when the affective commitment was low, WE did not 
change despite support from supervisors. This shows 
the moderating effect of affective commitment on the association between supervisors and WE’s support, thus partially supporting  Hypothesis  3. This finding suggests 
that nurses who are attached to the organization can work even more energetically if they have support from supervisors.
WE can be improved effectively by providing 
abundant job resources.
53 Based on the Pearson product-
moment correlation  coefficient,  the present study found 
a significant  positive association  between each variable 
of job resources and WE (Table 3). However, this result was not confirmed  in the hierarchical  multiple regres -
sion analysis (Tables 4 and 5). Therefore, it is essential 
to develop a deeper understanding of employees’ sense 
of belonging to their organizations and their value on 
their job descriptions.  Although the JD-R model posi -
tions WE as a mediator in the relationship between job 
resources and organizational commitment,
25 the present 
results observed individual  differences  in the extent to 
which job resources increased WE. In other words, it is conceivable that organizational commitment is formed by first improving  WE.
25 Furthermore, the present re -
sults suggest that organizational commitment indirectly affects WE through supervisors’  support, which is a job 
resource.
This study did not find significant moderating 
effects of affective commitment in the association of FWPS  with WLB and WE. Thus, Hypothesis 4 was not 
supported. Meanwhile, it was observed that when the affective commitment  was low, WE decreased if FWNS  
was high. Conversely,  when the affective commitment 
was high, there was no change in WE even when FWNS  was high. In other words, this study found that 
affective commitment had significant moderating effects  
on the association of FWNS  with WLB and WE. These 
results suggest that organizational attachment buffers the home’s negative influence, thus enabling nurses to 
continue to work energetically.
Aryee et al. reported that work–life balance is as-
sociated with affective commitment  and used the social 
exchange theory to explain the effect of WLB measures 
on organizations.
54, 55 They found that when employees 
perceive that the organization shows concern and inter -
est in their work and family roles, the employees begin to feel obligated to reciprocate to the organization.
54 
Possibly, when organizations promote WLB  policies 
that consider employees’ families, employees experi -
ence a sense of attachment to their organization, and they work energetically in return. Furthermore, due to the moderating effect of affective commitment on the association between FWNS  and WE, promotion of 
WLB  may enable nurses to continue to perform even 
better despite the negative impact of FWNS  on WE.
Finally, there were several limits to this study. The 
survey results were obtained from nurses working at a single university hospital. Therefore, it is necessary to verify these results with nurses from other institutions. Additionally,  as this was a cross-sectional  survey, each 
measured variable’s causal relationships cannot be de -
scribed. There is a need to conduct a longitudinal study in the future, especially to examine the causal relation -
ship between affective commitment  and WE. Further, 
WFPS  did not have a significant effect on WE. This 
study focused on examining the extent to which work–family spillover affects WE. Therefore,  WE was set as 
the dependent variable. However, studies have suggested 
that expending positive efforts at work has a positive 
work-to-family effect, that WE mediates WFPS.
56 
Further, they suggest that this relationship is linked to satisfaction with home life.
57 In the future, it will be 
necessary to examine this positive cycle of work and home balance in which WE mediates the relationship between FWPS  and WFPS . This study only examined 
affective commitment, the representative subordinate concept of organizational commitment. The present 
findings demonstrated the importance of the level of 
affective commitment  in the JD-R model motivational 
process. However, it will be necessary to verify whether normative and continuance commitment also have similar effects in the future. Finally, as described in the 
Discussion  section, the variables related to job resources 
used in this study were those of the work level variables 
280T. Fukuzaki et al.
© 2021 Tottori University Medical Pressin the representative occupational stress model.48, 49 
The present results demonstrate that WE improves due 
to the interaction between support from supervisors 
and affective commitment.  However, job resources are 
a comprehensive concept that includes other variables, 
such as how work is performed in the organization that 
were not used in this study.51 Therefore, in the future, 
it will be necessary to examine which variables of job resources are associated with WE and under which con -
ditions job resources exhibit an association with WE.
