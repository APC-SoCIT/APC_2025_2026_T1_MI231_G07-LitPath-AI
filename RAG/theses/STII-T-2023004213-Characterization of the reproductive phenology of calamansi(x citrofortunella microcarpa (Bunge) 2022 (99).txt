ABSTRACT

Calamansi (x Citrofortunella microcarpa (Bunge) Wijnands) is a highly seasonal
crop with peak production during rainy months when the farmgate price of calamansi is
meager, prompting many farmers to abandon calamansi production altogether. Because
there is a high price of calamansi during the off-season, this study examined how to extend
the availability or the harvest season of calamansi to catch higher prices during the lean
season. The hypothesis tested was that calamansi will also respond to the gibberellic acid
application like other Citrus species in retarding ripening for one to three months while still
attached to the tree; this has come to be known as “on-tree storage.” A study on
reproductive phenology was done to determine at what stage of fruit development would
be ideal for the treatment application. GA₃ can be applied 108 days from inflorescence
emergence during the wet season, or when fruits tum dark green, the peel is porous and
reached 90-100% (23-27 mm) of their final size. Three different GA₃ concentrations were
tested: 10, 20, and 40 ppm. The first foliar treatment of GA₃; was made before the fruits
have reached color break (BBCH Stage 79 and 80). Application at 10 and 20 ppm were
able to maintain the mature green stage and extend the harvest period for a month or 35
days with less than 17.5% fruits having a tinge of yellow. At 40 ppm, the mature green
stage was extended even longer to 46 days and showed no signs of color break. A second
application was done for all treatments when some fruits already had a color break,
however, the fruits did not revert to green color. The second application of GA₃ at 40 ppm
extended the harvest season to 63 days where approximately only one-fourth of the fruits
were at color break stage. Moreover, up to 90% of the fruits were retained, had thinner
peels and decreased rind ageing, while fruit firmness, total soluble solids and titratable
acidity remained unaffected.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

Calamansi (x Citrofortunella microcarpa (Bunge) Wijnands) is widely cultivated
and used as a condiment in dishes in the Philippines. In some parts of the world, calamansi
is called Philippine Lime, but most Filipinos call it calamansi or calamondin. In the Bicol
region, Visayas and Mindanao, it is known as limonsito. Among fruit crops, it ranks fourth

to banana, mango, and pineapple in terms of area and production (SEARCA, 2019).

The country is the only global major exporter of calamansi, either fresh or juices,
accounting for the most extensive exported products. Major markets include the UAE
(54.5%), USA (51.1%), Japan (25.6%), China (32.7%), Saudi Arabia (9.8%), and Hong
Kong (25.8%) (PSA, 2019). Data by Statista, as cited by Sanchez (2020), revealed that
the production value of calamansi in the country was worth about 2.6 billion Philippine

pesos.

Despite the importance of calamansi, production is declining. Philippine Statistics
Authority (PSA, 2020) reported that from 2015 to 2019, calamansi production dropped
from 162.68 to 125.97 thousand metric tons. The area planted decreased at an average rate
of 0.5 percent, from 19.99 to 19.62 thousand hectares. The number of bearing trees

decreased at an annual average rate of -0.6 percent, from 8.53 to 8.33 million bearing trees

in 2019. MIMAROPA Region remained the top producer of calamansi with 52.81 thousand
metric tons (41.9%) share of the total calamansi production. CALABARZON is the second
leading producer with a 13.03 thousand metric tons (10.3%) share, followed by Central

Luzon with an 8.3% share.

Calamansi production is highly seasonal, with a peak of production corresponding
to the rainy months and lean season during the dry months. In Oriental Mindoro, the lowest
farm-gate price (Php 4-6/kg) occur during the peak season months of June to September or
October and the price increased to Php 28-45/kg for the lean season months of November
to May (DA- PRDP, 2012). In 2019, farm gate price increased at Php 23.86/kg while the
retail price was Php 61.05/kg and the average cost of production per kilogram was Php
11.97 (PSA, 2019). The growers suffer because they receive a meager price during the peak
production months. Thus, this is the reason why calamansi production in MIMAROPA is

declining.

Fortunately, there is some hope, as the Department of Agriculture- Philippine Rural
Development Program (DA-PRDP) situationer noted that around 6% of the production was
off-season. In Roxas, Oriental Mindoro, they practice off-scason production by irrigating
their trees during the dry months. Thus, the growers there can take advantage of the high
prices during the dry months (Protacio, C. 2021, personal communication). However,
irrigation entails a high investment cost for deep well installation, pumps and hoses, and

fuel. Hence, alternative methods for off-season production are necessary.

One practice that could increase calamansi availability during the lean months is
on-tree storage. Coggins et al., (1966) pioneered the application of GAs on citrus fruit such
as lemons, limes, mandarins, oranges, and grapefruit in California in storing these fruits on
the tree. Foliar application of GAs has resulted in a significant delay in the rind color
development, as well as delay in rind senescence of mandarin fruits (Rokaya et al., 2016).
Application of exogenous GAs had an inhibitory effect in delaying fruit maturation in non-
climacteric fruits such as strawberry and citrus. It delays the synthesis of anthocyanin and
decrease the respiration rate when applied before the onset of color break, thus GAs aimed

in managing harvest periods of fruits while still on the tree (Alferez et al., 2021).

For calamansi, however, the effect of GAs on extending fruit availability by on-tree
storage has not been empirically proven yet. However, some promising results were seen
by the direct application of the technology in farmer’s fields in Oriental Mindoro starting
in 2017 (Protacio, C. 2021, personal communication). Carifio (2019) also reported the
inception of a study on the year-round production of calamansi in Oriental Mindoro. The
Tokyo University of Agriculture (Tokyo Nodai) cooperated with the Southeast Asian
Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA), who in turn,
partnered with the Mindoro State College of Agriculture and Technology (MinSCAT) to
study the use of pruning and plant growth regulators to delay the harvest of calamansi.
However, no definitive technology has emerged yet from these initial studies. Hence, this
study was conducted to investigate how to extend the availability of calamansi while still

attached to the tree to catch higher prices during the lean season.

OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY

The general objective of the study was to extend the harvest season of calamansi fruits
during the peak months such that fruits will still be available during the lean months with

the application of GAs.

The specific objectives of the study are:

© to characterize the reproductive phenology of calamansi under the existing
climate of Tagaytay City.

* to determine which GAs concentrations can prolong the mature green stage
of calamansi fruit while still attached to the tree.

* to evaluate fruit quality at the end of the on-tree storage period.

CHAPTER II

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

Calamansi (x Citrofortunella microcarpa (Bunge) Wijnands)

Origin and Distribution

Calamondin was found that it was originated in Southeast Asia, including the humid
tropical regions of China, north-eastern India, and Burma (Davenport, 1990). In China, it
was believed to be a natural hybrid between a sour, loose-skinned mandarin type,
presumably Citrus reticulata var. austera Swingle, and a kumquat, Fortunella margarita.
It was believed that it had been introduced and distributed during the early years in
Indonesia and the Philippines (Sotto, 1992). Nowadays, it is widely grown in India,
Australia, the USA, and throughout Southern and Southeast Asia like Japan and especially
in Malaysia. Lim (2012) added that it is a common omamental tree in Hawaii, the Bahamas,

some islands of the West Indies, and parts of Central America.

Morphological Description

The calamansi tree, locally known as kalamondin or calamondin, is an evergreen

shrub, attaining 2 to 7.5 m in height. The tree is small with a long taproot, slender stem,

and slightly spiny and upright branches. The leaves are oval with glossy dark green color
above and pale green below that is alternately arranged. The leaves are aromatic when
crushed. The petiole is 1cm long. The flowers are bisexual, white, and grouped in clusters,
having five petals, either located in the axillary, terminal, or both. Flowers are fragrant and
white, measuring 1.5-3.0 cm long and ready to open. Stamens have 20 filaments that are
clustered in a tube. The calyx is 1 mm long with five lobbed shapes. Pedicels are 6-8 mm
long. The fruits are small and globose or oblate, ranging from 2 to 4.5 cm in diameter,
having six to ten segments. The rind is very thin and can be easily peeled, greenish-yellow
to orange-red, with numerous oil glands. The flesh is color orange and tender, and its juice
is very acidic. It has approximately 11 seeds or sometimes no seed at all. It is an obovoid,
small, plump, and usually, polyembryonic condition wherein embryos are developed in a

single fertilized egg (Sotto, 1992).

Growth and Development

Seeds usually germinate after 10-15 days. Stem elongation of the sexual plant
begins with terminal growth with successive sprouting of lateral buds. The formation of
floral shoots ends with the extension of the axis, and lateral shoots became the main
mode of branching. The tree flowers throughout the year and produces fruits. The flowers
are self-fertile. Fruits mature about five months from flowering. The harvest season lasts
for three months. The peak season of calamansi fruits is between July to October, while

the lean season is between November to May. Clonal trees bear fruits in 3 years after

planting, while the seedlings after 5-6 years, The calamondin tree can bear 5,000 fruits

after six years (Sotto, 1992).

Management and Requirements

Calamansi trees are adaptable with long dry periods provided with irrigation and
are mainly grown over many soil types, from clay loam to limestone to sand. Calamansi is
predominantly grown in lowlands, and it grows best in a slightly acidic pH at 5.5~7.0, well-
drained sandy or clay loam soil rich in organic matter, and a moderate drought tolerant and
intolerant to strong winds. The calamansi best thrives in warm to cool climates with 1,500-
2,000 mm/ycar of evenly distributed rainfall (Sotto, 1992, p. 118; Lim, 2012). The agro-
climatic conditions in Oriental Mindoro are so suitable for calamansi farming that the
province has since been known as the Calamansi King of the Philippines (DA-PRDP,

2012).

Planting and Propagation

The calamansi can be propagated sexually by seeds. Each seed contains 3-5
embryos that produce true-to-type, spiny seedlings. Calamansi seed produces plants that
originate mainly from the mother tissues giving rise to the seedlings, which have the same
characteristics as the mother tree. Superior trees arc propagated by stem cuttings,

marcotting, and grafting. For large-scale multiplication, shield budding on calamansi

rootstock and mandarin is practiced in the Philippines. In the USA, particularly in Florida,
large-scale propagation for pot culture is done by root cuttings under continuous misting.
After 4-5 months from planting, seedlings are 10-15 cm tall and ready to be transplanted
in individual containers. For field transplanting, seedlings are transplanted 4-6 m apart in

hexagonal pattems or rows and this is usually done during the rainy season (Sotto, 1992).

Fertilization

During the first year after planting, urea is applied at 50-100 g per tree and increased
to 200-300 g per tree during the second year. When the tree starts bearing fruit at maturity
in the third year and increases to 350-400g complete fertilizer per tree should also be
supplied. Correspondingly, increase the number of fertilizers as the tree gets older.
Fertilizer must apply in two applications, one at the onset of the rainy season and another
towards the end of the rainy season. Weeding under the trees helps to maintain tree growth,
and pruning removes the diseased and dead branches (Sotto, 1992; Business Diary

Philippines, 2018).

Pest and Diseases

Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, is widely distributed in tropical and
subtropical Asia and in the Americas. It serves as a vector of Huanglongbing (HLB) or

known as citrus greening disease or leaf mottling, together with Trioza erytreae or

commonly known as African citrus psyllid. Citrus rind borer is the major problem for citrus
tree growers in the Philippines. It infests flower buds until the early development of fruits.
The Mediterranean and Caribbean fruit flies account for the decline in the number of

calamansi trees planted in Florida (Sotto, 1992; Ceballo et al., 2022).

Phenology of Flowering of Citrus

Effects of Temperatures and Water Stress on Citrus Phenology

Climate plays an important role in the growth and development of the citrus plant.
Citrus trees, like other fruit trees, are polycarpic plants undergoing repeated cycles of
flowering and fruiting. Floral induction is triggered by various environmental situations or
temperatures (Davenport, 1990). In subtropical or temperate arcas, citrus tree flowers in
response to cold stress and winter temperatures or when but also produce periodic
vegetative flushes of flowers throughout the year. Flowering takes place after a period of
bud quiescence and exposure to low temperatures and short days of winter. On the other
hand, in tropical areas, bud sprouting and flowering occurred throughout the year and were
triggered in response to drought stress (Iglesias et al., 2007).

Water stress is a substitute for chilling stress in the tropics which have distinct rainy
and dry seasons Rainfall with less than 100 to 150mm per month is sufficient to induce
flowering when the trees are relieved of stress (Davenport, 1990). Water deficit was known

as a strong inductor of flowering in citrus, which increased the floral shoots and number of

flowers (Iglesias et al., 2007; Cassin et al.,1969). Water stress seems to be the significant
flower-inducing signal under semitropical conditions. Water stress has traditionally been
used to induce flowering in lemons and related cultivars, which naturally produce some
flowers throughout the year. (Spiegel-Roy & Goldschmidt, 1996).

High temperature and water stress (drought) inhibit ovule fertilization, thus
reducing fruit set, increasing June drop, and reducing yield. From fruit button set to fruit
maturity, fruit growth is more sensitive to heat stress and reduced irrigation. Water stress,
nutrient deficiencies, high temperature, and poor health of trees are believed to be the main
cause of physiological fruit drops. Water stress during the growth and development of
citrus fruit can harm yield and fruit quality compared to well-watered trees, and fruit losses
are hard to recover (Levy and Boman, 2003).

In tropical areas, the phenological life cycle of citrus occurs the whole year from
February to the next year of January. But in subtropical areas, the flowering phase starts
from February to March and is considered a critical period for citrus production (Shafqat
et al., 2020). Exposure to low enough temperatures for a long period, initiates more
flowering than increasing exposure to cold temperature (Archer et al., 2021). During the
dry scason, there are no changes in temperature throughout the year. Thus, flower induction
is not associated with low temperature, but irrigation after drought triggers the flowering
phase (Carr, 2012). Rainfall in tropical areas is well distributed from April to November,
with high rainfall throughout the year, with dry periods of 2-3 or 5 months in between

(Agusti et al., 2022).


One of the main environmental factors affecting plant growth is solar radiation.
Solar radiation is the main source of energy for carbon assimilation and growth, affecting
plant evolution and acclimation. According to previous studies, the plant dry mass such as
leaf, shoot, root, and the whole plant increased, and the number of the leaves responded
similarly to light intensity or during full ambient light (FAL) and decreased as much as the
plants were shaded. This indicated that high-light grown plants yielded greater productivity
than low-light grown plants. However, plant height was increased as the light intensity
decreased. When plants were grown in shade areas, plant height increases, this resembled
to etiolated grown plants which have unusually tall appearance. Additionally, the plants
grown under 25% of FAL showed decreased photosynthetic rate, transpiration, and
stomatal conductance about 70, 30 and 50% respectively when compared with the ones
grown under 100% of FAL (Zervoudakis et al., 2012).

Temperatures of 35° C and above reduce photosynthetic activity; optimum
temperatures for citrus trees are 25 to 30° C. The rise in leaf temperature may be involved
in high-irradiation damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, which has recently been
observed in citrus leaves. In tropical conditions, citrus flower in response to dry months or
drought, Water stress during the growth and development of citrus fruit can harm the yield
and fruit quality compared to well-watered trees, and losses may not be recovered entirely
through proper irrigation. Severe water deficits result in wilting, abscission of leaves, poor
fruit quality, and small fruit size. Moreover, water stress may result in smaller, lighter fruit
with thicker peel and reduced juice content. Additionally, water deficit causes an increased

concentration of sugar, while excessive rainfall or irrigation results in dilution of the sugars


in the juice. Reducing irrigation before harvest may increase sugar concentration but may
reduce juice content. Additionally, drought increases peel thickness and color break is

delayed when the irrigation is increased (Levy and Boman, 2003).

Moderate drought stress reduces shoot growth and leaf expansion, slows canopy
development and cropping in young trees, and reduces vegetative growth needed to support
fruit production in mature trees. However, flooding causes asphyxiation of the roots and
can cause severe damage or death to citrus trees planted in heavy, poorly- drained soils.
Citrus foot rot, a fungal disease caused by Phytophthora spp., is related to high soil water
content, and can be found in lemon, sweet orange, sweet lime, Rangpur lime, and a self-
rooted lime. The best preventive measure is to provide good drainage (Levy and Boman,

2003).

Flowering Type of Citrus

The flowering stage is the next process after flower induction which develops from
a receptive terminal or tip of a shoot and axillary bud, located between the leaf and the
shoots when environmental conditions favor initiation of bud-break such as cool
temperatures and water stress (Stander, 2015). Terminal flower buds sprout first, and
flowers are more abundant towards the apical region of a shoot with a predominantly leafy
or leafless inflorescence and lateral axillary flowers later. The most distal flower is usually
the most developed and the first to reach anthesis. The time and duration of flower bloom

are highly variable even for the same cultivar, and slight climatic differences between


locations might affect the time of flowering. Even within the same tree, the southwest
quadrant (in the northern hemisphere) is usually the first to open its flowers, whereas the
northeast quadrant is the last. Additionally, the difference in time of anthesis might be in
regard to climatic conditions affecting fruit set and subsequent fruit development (Spiegel-
Roy and Goldschmidt, 1996). Iglesias et al. (2007) also stated that a high temperature
accelerates anthesis and shortens the flowering period while a low temperature extends the
flowering period.

A leafy inflorescence is a combination of one or more flowers with leaves and
sprout from the apical buds of a shoot. The leafless inflorescence is characterized by a
flower bud with no leaves and is more abundant towards the base with a low fruit setting.
In most citrus cultivars, leafy inflorescences produce higher fruit sets and eventually larger
fruit sizes than leafless inflorescences. The presence of leaves increases the CO2
assimilation (Iglesias et al., 2007), and the supply of photoassimilates is higher in terminal

shoots and has a well-developed xylem cylinder and a higher number of vascular bundles.

Fruit Development of Citrus

Fruit development of citrus is divided into three development phases which follow
a sigmoidal curve. Phase I is characterized by the cell division period, which is the
beginning of the fruit set, where the formation of most of the cellular structures like growth
in the peel of the fruit happens. El-Otmani et al. (201 1) stated the peel reaches its maximum

thickness at or the end of stage I.


Phase II corresponds to the fruit growth stage, this is where cell enlargement occurs,
and most of the fruit diameter comprises the rind and juice sacs enlarge and fill the locule
(segments), ultimately eventually adding total weight to the fruit. During this period, the
fruit pulp volume increases substantially and makes up most of the fruit diameter until
harvest (Stander, 2015; Spicgel-Roy & Goldschmidt, 1996). The peel tissues become
distinct into flavedo (compact tissue) and albedo (spongy tissue) at the early stages. The
peel becomes thinner as the fruit reaches the end of phase II. The final cell size during this
phase is critical for final fruit size, which is a crucial component of fruit quality in the
marketplace (El-Otmani et al.,2011).

In phase III, known as the fruit maturation phase or ripening phase, the fruit size
may increase or may not increase at all. Pulp growth stops, which leads to the formation of
cracks between the peel and pulp. Also, the albedo separates from pulp, known as “puffing”
(Spiegel-Roy & Goldschmidt, 1996). This results in damage and development of weak
areas in the peel, thus making fruit more fragile and highly susceptible to mechanical

injuries during postharvest handling (El-Otmani et al.,2011).

Importance and Uses of Citrus Fruits

Citrus fruits are produced mainly for fresh fruit consumption. Citrus fruits have
been recognized for their nutritional value and health benefits to humans. In addition, citrus
juice is the main source of vitamin C. Juice of oranges and other citrus fruits is often
recognized as an important source of vitamin C and is most preferred because of its flavor.

This was one of the main reasons for the large consumption of fresh citrus fruit and juice


worldwide. One important property of fresh citrus fruits is the low energy value because
of the sodium concentration and replacement by potassium, which may be important for
low-fat and restricted diets. Moreover, vitamin C is beneficial in the formation of collagen,
a critical function in the strengthening of ligaments, blood vessels, and bones, also in
wound healing. Vitamin C is not only useful for the prevention of colds but also has an
antioxidant function in protecting cells against damage from free radicals like cancer and
cataracts, and other infections of the eye (El-Otmani, 2011).

In the Philippines, calamondin is also valued for its fresh fruit for its juice, and it is
commercially processed into bottled concentrated or juice. It is also made into marmalade
or preserved whole in sugar syrup. It is also used as a flavor enhancer for kinds of seafood
or meats. The juice can also be used as a stain remover in clothes, cleaning agents, natural
body deodorant, skin bleach, and hair shampoo. Besides that, it can be used to treat skin
irritation, it can be used as a cough remedy, anti-inflammation, laxative, and can expel
phlegm when added with pepper. Calamondin tree may also serve as rootstock for lemons
and kumquat, and lastly, it is commontly used as potted omamental plants in other countries
(Sotto, 1992). Lim (2012) added that calamansi has antimicrobial activity. The findings
showed that both the crude extract and its bioactive component (2-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-
tricarboxylic acid monohydrate) might have potential as an antimicrobial agent against

pathogenic fish bacteria; thus, it can be used for aquaculture.


On-Tree Storage Method

Wang et al. (2019) compared the fruit quality of pummelo by on-tree and indoor
storage to determine the appropriate storage method for improving the fruit quality. As for
extemal fruit quality, the peel thickness decreased with the increase of storage times for
indoor storage. Huang et al. (1999) and Liu et al. (2010) stated that this was because of the
loss of fruit water and constriction of the spongy layer so that the peel was obviously
shrunken. The on-tree fruits could receive the supplement of water and nutritional materials
to effectively delay the shrinkage of fruit peel. After 90 days of on-tree storage, three
pummelo cultivars started to have a storage taste. In addition, vitamin C and sugar contents
decreased with the increase of on-tree storage times. To summarize, it is better to store for
90 days on-tree and indoor storage for 'Sanhongmiyou' and 'Hongroumiyou' for 60 days
for ‘Huangjinmiyou'. By comparison, fruits on-tree storage showed better quality than that
indoor storage.

Exogenous application of GAs retarded pigment changes in the fruit and prevented
puffiness of the peel. Also, GA3 prevented the late peel of growth Satsuma’ mandarin
(Citrus unshiu Marc.), which takes place after the cessation of pulp growth and retarded
the loss of juice from the ripe fruit, allowing on-tree storage of the fruit for more than two
months after commercial ripening (Garcia-Luis et al., 1985). In addition, Rokaya et al.
(2016) reported that GA3 was proved to delay the ripening of the fruits for one month by
delaying the chlorophyll development and reducing the loss of texture, decreasing sugar

content and increasing acidity.


Similar to Marzouk & Kassem (2010), GAs sprays (and other growth regulators
including putrescine, 2,4-D, and chelated calcium) had positive influences in decreasing
fruit external characteristics disorder and delaying fruit senescence at the harvest date of a
navel orange. Moreover, GA3 increased peel thickness and decreased rind ageing,
softening, creasing color change, and the number of unfit export fruits. They also
concluded that spraying the different used substances or their combinations will allow
growers to have longer on-tree storage for navel oranges, thus, expanding the harvest
period and export season of fruit with good quality. The GA treatments alone and the
combination of GA plus I-MCP delayed fruit degreening under both storage regimes (2,
6, 12, or 20 °C). GA significantly inhibited fruit degreening, and the fruit remained
completely green. Apart from the effects of GA on the retention of peel color, neither GA.
nor 1-MCP had any effect on internal fruit quality characteristics such as TSS and acid

content, nor on postharvest storage performance (Porat, 2001).

METHODOLOGY

Overview

The first part of the study focused on the phenology of flower anthesis until fruit
development using the extended BBCH scale for citrus while the second study focused on
determining the effects of gibberellic acid on prolonging the green color of calamansi fruits
while still attached on the tree. The effect of gibberellic acid on other physical and

biochemical characteristics was also analyzed.

Time and Place of the Study

The study was conducted in an orchard farm at 14°09'05"N 121°00'17"E, in
Tagaytay City, Cavite, from February 2021 to December 2021. Tagaytay is situated 663 m
(2,175 ft) above sea level. During the entire year, the area's average precipitation
aggregates up to 2546mm (100.24") from the rainy season, which falls from May to
November. Tagaytay belongs to Type I climate according to Philippine Atmospheric,
Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). Type I climate has
two pronounced seasons, a five- month dry period from November to April and a wet
period during the rest of the year. The maximum rain period is from June to September or

until October.


Study 1. Reproductive phenology of calamansi

Flower and fruit development were monitored in six (6) calamansi trees based on
the Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und Chemische Industrie (BBCH) scale
of Meier (2001) during dry and wet season. There were four replicate blocks for a total of
16 trees monitored. The tags contained information about the dates of tagging the floral

bud initials.

Data gathered

2. Weather Data and Growing Degree Days (GDD). The daily temperature (minimum
and maximum), relative humidity, and precipitation were monitored and recorded.
Accumulated growing degree-days (GDD) from bud break to fruit maturity were
calculated using the daily minimum air temperature (Tm) and maximum air
temperature (TM), with a lower base temperature (Tb) of 12.8°C and an upper
threshold temperature (TB) of 36°C; and the formulas as suggested by Unigarro (2017)

Statistical Analyses

Data gathered was tested to compare the means of two measurements taken from
the same subject using PROC TTEST with the PAIRED statement through SAS
OnDemand for Academics. Data were collected twice on the same subjects where the
season (Dry and Wet) was monitored and recorded. The p-value as Pr >| t | was specified

at the desired significance level (< 0.05).

Study 2: Delaying on-tree ripening of fruits by foliar application of GAs

Four (4) treatments with two (2) blocks, replicated twice were done. Treatments
were (T1) Control; (T2) 10 ppm GAs; (T3) 20 ppm GAs; and (T4) 40 ppm GA3, Trees were

supplemented with complete fertilizer and Urea (500 g in split application) in February


2021 and in September 2021. Phytosanitary pruning removal of dead and interlacing
branches and removal of weeds were done. Inducing the trees by water stress for a month

(P- plants 1-16, B- blocks, R- replications, T- treatments)

A total of 16 trees were used in the study, and gibberellic acid (GAs) as treatment
was applied as a full cover spray on the trees using a hand sprayer at a rate of 4 L per tree
when the fruits reached BBCH scale no. 79 and 80 or before the color break. The spreader
sticker Carrier™ Natural Spray Oil (93% pure vegetable oil) was also added to all GAs

spray solutions. The first application was on September 29, 2021. Observation on color


change was monitored for three months. A second spray was done on November 15, 2021,

or when the fruits started to tum yellow.

Data Gathered

In this study, the determination of fruit’s physical and biochemical characteristics
was determined as given below:

L. Fruit retention (%). Ten (10) dark green 40% (BBCH scale 74 and 75) of final

size fruit were tagged at random for each tree and monitored after GAs application

for the assessment of fruit retention until harvest time. Fruit retention was

determined monthly after GAs treatments were applied. Below is the formula used:
Fruit retention (%) = total no. of retained fruits / total no. of tagged fruits x 100

2. Peel color. Pee! color was evaluated using a color index: 1-fully green peel, 2-green
with a trace of yellow, 3- more green than yellow, 4- more yellow than green, 5-
yellow with a trace of green, 6- fully yellow (PHTRC, n.d.).

3. Peel thickness. Thickness was measured by a digital caliper (mm).

4. Rind ageing. Rind ageing was estimated as the percent of fruit with peel pitting
(Kassem et al., 2012). Peel pitting is a disorder characterized with a sunken area of
flavedo (pits) that eventually spreads and affects the oil glands (Alferez et al.,
2004).

5. Fruit diameter. The diameter of the fruit was measured using a digital caliper

(mm).


. Fruit weight. Weight was measured by a digital weighing scale (g) to

determine juice content.

. Juice content. Juice content was measures by extracting the juice using a

hand squeezer and getting the volume of juice. Juice content percentage was
determined by getting the total volume of juice (ml) over the total fruit

weight of ten fruits (g).

. Fruit firmness. Firmness was evaluated using a handheld penetrometer (model

GY-2) by first removing the peel of citrus and slowly pushing the tip into the flesh
(against the segments) of the fruit until determined by a marking ring. Readings

were repeated thrice for better results (Kg/em’).

. Total soluble solids (TSS). Total soluble solids were determined by a handheld

refractometer. Three drops of calamansi juice were applied to the refractometer
prism, avoiding bubbles and large pulp particles. Refractometer is tumed towards
the light to see a better result. The reading where the base of the blue color sits on

the scale were recorded as percentage sugar (Brix%).

|. Titratable acidity (TA). Titratable acidity of the juice was obtained by titrating

against a 0.1N NaOH solution (AOAC, 1999). A digital weighing scale was used
to measure ten calamansi fruits. Fruit juice was extracted using a handheld
citrus squeezer and the total volume of juice was measured. The extracted
juice was filtered, and 2 ml was pipetted to each of the three flasks. Twenty
ml of distilled water was also added in each flask. One to three drops of

Phenolphthalein were added and titrated until a faint pink color persisted for


30 seconds. The volume of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) used to reach the
endpoint was recorded. Initial and final volumes from burette were also
recorded. The total titratable acidity was computed using the formula:

% TA= (VN) NaOH x (Meg. Wt. of predominant acid) X 100
Wt. equivalent of aliquot (g)

Where:

V= volume of NaOH used

‘Wt equivalent of aliquot = (fresh weight of sample in g/ total volume of juice in ml) x
volume of aliquot ml

N= normality of NaOH used (0.1N)

Meg. Wt of predominant acid= 0.064 g

Statistical Analyses

Data gathered was tested for homogeneity of variance using the Levene test as the
post-hoc analyses performed through the one-way ANOVA using the PROC GLM
procedure, and for normality, PROC UNIVARIATE was completed by SAS OnDemand
for Academics. Statistical significance was at P <0.05 (Gomez and Gomez, 1984). Data
with declared significant differences were subjected to a mean comparison method using

Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test.

CHAPTER IV

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Reproductive Phenology of Calamansi

Itis essential to examine the crop’s phenology to understand the plant development
schedule, the best time for fertilizers and pesticide application, and the period from flower
to fruit development as influenced by temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Doing so
will help farmers with the right timing of agricultural practices. The first study focused on
the phenology of flower and fruit development of calamansi fruits during the dry and wet
seasons. The BBCH Scale by Meier (2001) was elaborated from inflorescence emergence
up to fruit maturity in this study. Inflorescence emergence is designated as principal growth
stage 5 with five substages as given below and illustrated in Figure 4.

Principal growth stage 5: Inflorescence emergence

51: buds start to swell and light green scales were already visible.

53: bud bursts and scales were separated, and floral tips were evident

54/55: tiny green buds are already visible, and single or multi-flowered leafy or

leafless inflorescences can be seen
56: petals starting to elongate, and sepals were covering half of the corolla (white

bud)

59: most of the flowers with petals formed a hollow ball

Figure 4. Principal growth stage 5 (BBCH 51-59) of calamansi (x
Citrofortunella microcarpa (Bunge) Wijnands)

In stage | of floral initiation, the average size of the flower buds ranges from 0.19
mm size during the second day of development, and then followed by stage 2, the formation
sepal primordia, also known as a button, with an average length of 0.44 mm. The sepals
will tum dark green, which takes three days to open. The color will change to light green
when the size reaches 3.45 mm after the 7" day of flower development. In Stage 56, the
ovary, style stigma, were already developed. The wet and dry seasons had no significant
influence on Stage 5 (P= 0.1449). Monitoring of Stage 5 took ten days during the dry
season and 11 days during the wet season. The same outcome from the observation of
Mapalo and Rosillo-Magno (2018), 10 days after bud initiation, the ovary, stigma, and style
became visible.

Figure 5 shows the two types of inflorescences observed: the leafy and leafless.
The leafy inflorescence is a combination of one or more flowers and leaves, and this took
place in the apical buds of the shoots (determinate). In leafless inflorescence, flowers were
produced with no leaves, and located in apical shoots. The leafless types produced early
flowering and produced more flowers than in leafy type. On the other hand, leafy flowers

located in axillary buds of the shoots were most abundant towards the base of the shoots


(Figure 5). Carr (2012) stated that the level of fruit set is dependent on the type of

Principal growth stage 6: flowering

60: first flowers opened

61: beginning of flowering, 10% of the flowers open,

65: full flowering, where 50% of flowers open, and first falling of petals occur
67; most petals had fallen

69: all petals had fallen, and this indicated the end of flowering

inflorescence. Leafless inflorescences contain a bouquet of flowers with a low likelihood
of setting fruit. On the other hand, leafy inflorescences are associated with a better fruit set.
The fewer the number of flowers, probably have a higher chance of fruits forming. The

flower bud can be developed in 1-2 days with a prominent bulge inflorescence meristem.

After inflorescence emergence, the next principal stage is flowering designated

as Stage 6 as illustrated in Figure 6 and its substages described below.


Figure 6. Principal growth stage 6 (BBCH 60-69) of calamansi (x
Citrofortunella microcarpa (Bunge) Wijnands)

‘According to Mapalo and Rosillo-Magno (2018), the size of the fully developed
flower extended to 13.71 mm. Furthermore, the period of anthesis for citrus varieties is
dependent on the species, climatic conditions, and the position of the flower in the shoot.
‘There was a significant difference in Stage 6 (flowering stage) between the two seasons
(P= 0.0013). During the dry season, it took 7-8 days for Stage 6 to complete and it starts,
from February to March. For the wet season, the process was completed in 6-8 days, and

the flowering stage occurred from June to July.

Figure 7. Principal growth stages (BBCH 71-79) of calamansi (x
Citrofortunella microcarpa (Bunge) Wijnands)


Principal growth stage 7: fruit development

71: start of fruit development, the beginning of the fruit set and growth of the ovary

73: fruits 30% of their final size, some fruits became slightly yellow, which was
also the beginning of physiological fruit drop

74: fruits were dark green, and the size was about 40% of the final (around 10-15
mm).

79: fruits were about 90% (around 23-27 mm) of their final size.

Two waves of fruit drop were observed per season. The first wave occurred from
late March to late April (32-36 days) from the fruit set during the dry season and from late
June to early July (11 days) during the wet season. On the other hand, the second wave
occurred in early May (9 days) during the dry season and in September (12 days) during
the wet season. According to Amparo (2021), fruit drop happened for 30 days in potted,
well-watered, and fertilized trees. Fruits that have dropped were observed primarily at
Stage 73 and before Stage 79. Increased fruit drops were observed at BBCH Stage 77
during dry season than rainy season. The size of fruits that dropped was about 4 -12 mm in

diameter and weighed 0.2-12.25g (Figure 8).

Figure 8. Fruits tumed yellow and dropped before BBCH Stage 79.
Fruit size ranges from 4 -12 mm, weighing 0.2-12.25 g


The reason for fruit drop might be because there was limited water availability
during dry season. Iglesias et al. (2007) claimed that water stress or moderate water deficit
may trigger fruitlet abscission because ABA (primary sensitive signal to water stress)
accumulated in the roots which regulates the level of ethylene content, a hormone that
activates leaf and fruit abscission. The suppression of water supply during flowering and
fruit set period reduced shoot extension and increased the abscission of flower buds and
small fruits when irrigation was introduced in early summer. High temperatures and dry
environments induce dehydration of trees. Thus, growth in general, is prevented, and
abscission is triggered. When drought stress persists, abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis
increases, leading to stomatal closure also decrease photosynthetic activity. With improved
irrigation during fruit set, the number of fruits may increase (Carr, 2012).

There are two kinds of fruit drop or fruit abscission during fruit development: at the
onset of phase I (cell division) and during phase II (cell enlargement). According to
Spiegel-Roy and Goldschmidt (1996), fruitlet abscission is a self-thinning mechanism to
adjust the crop load of a tree, and less than 1% becomes a fruit and reaches maturity. It is
a natural way to balance fruit numbers to avoid carbohydrate depletion and increase fruit
size during fruit development (Vashisth ct al., 2020). However, fruit abscission during fruit
maturity is regarded as part of the evolutionary for seed dispersal and termed a “preharvest
drop.” It is assumed that auxin declines as the fruit reaches maturity. In citrus tree spp.,
fruit abscission generally occurs in abscission zone A (AZ-A), located between the twig
and the peduncle, while abscission zone C (AZ-C) is in the calyx. This is where most fruits

abscise during the ripening or maturation period (Iglesias et al., 2007).


Significant differences (P= <.0001) were obtained between two seasons in Stage 7.
Stage 7 was completed in 58-66 days (average of 62 days) during the dry season and 88-
95 days (average of 91 days) during the wet season. Amparo (2021) reported that the whole
process took about 70 to 84 days to complete. Mapalo and Rosillo-Magno (2018) had the
same observation; fruits attained commercial maturity at 78 to 84 days from fruit set during
November to February. Because the observations were made during the wet season in
Tagaytay City, the Principal Growth Stage 7 was prolonged as compared with the result of
‘Amparo (2021) and Mapalo and Rosillo-Magno (2018). This can be traced to the cooler
climate and less solar radiation received in this location because of cloudy or foggy
conditions.

The last growth stage is fruit maturity or Stage 8, detailed description with its
substages is listed below and presented in Figure 9.

Principal growth stage 8: fruit maturity

81: peel is smooth and shinier; fruits start to change in color (color-break)

83: fruit is ripe for picking; the color turned slightly yellow; fruit diameter ranges
from 26.16- 27.86 mm.

85: advanced ripening and intensity of peel color change increase

89: fruit is ripe for juice consumption; fruit has typical taste and firmness; the

beginning of senescence, and fruit abscission


Figure 9. Principal growth stages (BBCH 81-89) of calamansi (x
Citrofortunella microcarpa (Bunge) Wijnands)

A significant difference to complete Stage 8 was detected in the two seasons (P=
<.0001). The fruit development was completed in 32 days during the dry season and was
extended to 12 days longer (44 days) during wet season. Amparo (2021) states that the four
substages (Stages 81-85) of calamansi maturity can all be considered harvestable,
depending on the purpose. Calamansi fruits that fall on Stages 81 and 83 can be stored at
ambient temperature until fruits can be transported. Stage 83 can also be distributed to
nearby markets or consumed immediately. But basically, most calamansi fruits are

preferred to be harvested and consumed when still green or reached color break (Stage 81).

Ripe citrus fruits can be utilized as fresh fruit or processed into juice and specialty
products. Citrus grown for the fresh market requires more extensive inputs in production
and harvesting than citrus produced for processing. Processing of citrus fruits provide an
economical way to store and transport citrus from production regions to distant markets
(Bates ct al., 2001). Stages 85 and 89 fit in this category. Bates et al. (2001) noted that

citrus fruits that are more delicate and softer cannot be kept intact over long periods and


tend to deteriorate before or at harvesting; thus, juicing is the logical alternative morcover,

one practical reason for processing is to increase consumption of citrus fruits.

Duration of each principal stage of reproductive phenology as affected by season

The effect of season on the duration of reproductive phenology is summarized in
Figure 10. Stage 5 was unaffected by scason while stages 6 to 8 were influenced by season.
Stage 6 was extended by two more days during the dry compared to the wet season. One
possible explanation for Stage 6 taking longer days to complete is high temperature, which
tends to develop shoots rather than flowers. However, fruit development took a longer time
during the wet season. It took 94 days from fruit set (Stage 7) to reach fruit maturity (Stage
8) during the dry season and 135 days during the wet season or 41 days longer. Moreover,
it took 112 days from inflorescence emergence (Stage 5) to fruit maturity (Stage 8) during

the dry season and 152 days during the wet season.

In contrast to the results above, Mapalo and Rosillo-Magno (2018) obtained
commercial fruit maturity at 94 to 101 days from inflorescence emergence. However, note
that commercial maturity was harvestable at green mature stage or excluding Stage 8. The
equivalent number of days as shown in this study (Stage 5 or inflorescence emergence to
Stage 7 or fruits at maximum size) is 108 days shown in Figure 10. Essentially, the aim of
this study when stated in phenological terms is to extend the Stage 7 for as long as possible

before color break occurs.

Phenology and growing degree days

Season was shown to influence the duration of the various phenological stages in
the previous section which illustrated the effects of climate. In line with this, Growing
Degree Days (GDD) was calculated because it is a weather-based indicator for assessing
plant development stages. GDD or heat units are measured, and the heat accumulation is
calculated to complete the plant development or phenological stages. The temperature is
averaged daily above a lower base temperature and below a maximum threshold
temperature to complete plant development (Gordon and Bootma, 1993; Miller et al.,
2018). The daily weather data prevailing at the time of the study is shown graphically in

Figure 11.


Figure 11. Daily weather data (rainfall, average relative humidity, sunshine,
windspeed, and temperature) in Tagaytay City, Cavite

The GDD from inflorescence emergence (Stage 5) to fruit maturity (Stage 8) are
shown in Figure 12. It took 111 days and needed 4,314.33 GDD to reach BBCH Stage 89
during the dry season. During the wet season, it took 152 days and required 3,488.83 GDD
to reach fruit maturity. The dry season recorded the highest total accumulated GDD than
wet season. Stage 7 and Stage 8 took a longer period of average days on both season but,
growing degree days (GDD) was high during Stage 6 and Stage 7 then decreased when
Stage 8 was reached in both seasons. Similarly, Amparo (2021) reported that fruit
development (Stage 7) contributed to the longer process of growth in rainfed trees (84 days)
compared in potted trees (70 and 81 days). From bud development (Stage 0) until fruit
maturation (Stage 8), 5,977.13 heat units (GDD) were required for rainfed trees situated in

Laguna.

Delaying On-tree Ripening of Fruits by Foliar Application of GAs

From the phenological study, it was ascertained that BBCH Stage 79-80 was the
target stage for the GAs treatment that aimed in extending the availability of green fruits
for harvesting during the lean season. Calamansi fruits are harvested and consumed when
still green or just after reaching color break (Stage 81). Fruits harvested after color break
usually fetch lower price at the farm gate as compared to green fruits because there will be
‘more postharvest losses after transport and distribution.


Overall, the experiment was successful that GAs application at all concentrations
extended the green stage by 28 to 56 days (Figure 13). The control fruits started to change
color a week after the treatment. However, only the lower concentrations at 10 and 20 ppm
of GAs resulted in color break after 28 days but a week later only less than 17.5% of the
fruits had a tinge of yellow. By 42 days after the GAs treatment, roughly half of the treated
fruits attained color break stage. It can be safely stated that a 20 ppm of GA; treatment will
extend the green mature stage to 35 days with less than 10% of the fruits at color break
stage. Doubling the concentration to 40 ppm of GAs resulted in fruits that remained green
up to 46 days and showed no signs of color break.

However, a second application of all GAs treatments was done 46 days after the
initial treatment. The objective was to determine if the fruits at color break will revert to
the green color. The color change of fruits treated with 10 ppm and 20 ppm progressed and
did not revert to its green color. In contrast, fruits treated with a second dose of 40 ppm of
GAs remained green for 56 days, and after another week approximately one fourth of the
fruits started to change in peel color or at day 63. This study demonstrated that foliar
application of GA3 on BBCH scale 79-80 could extend the harvest time up to 28 days for
the initial treatment or for the whole month of October, which is the off-season period of
calamansi fruits, regardless of the second application of GAs, Additionally, a 40 ppm could
prolong the harvest period until 56 days or until November.

Abscisic acid (ABA) and GAs have antagonistic effects during fruit maturation,
concentration of GA declines before color break and begins the increase of ABA in the

peel, This is associated with coloration including chlorophyll degradation and pigment


accumulation. The greener the peel of the citrus, there was more GA3 than ABA (Alferez
et al. 2021). Gibberellic acid treatments delayed senescence, softened rind, changed
essential oil and the rind color rate, and reduced the rind crease severity in citrus fruits

(Garmendia et al., 2019).

Fruit Retention. While the green fruit color was maintained for up to two months,
the question arose as to whether the fruits were retained on the tree and did not drop. Foliar
application of GAs significantly (P= 0.05) retained most of the fruits in 40 ppm of GAs,
accounting for 97.50% after 56 days of on-tree storage (Table 2). This is a very significant
achievement as it means only 2.5% loss in fruits after close to two months of on-tree
storage. At 70 days after the initial spray, more fruits dropped to only 80-90% retention.

The fruits should have been harvested at this time anyway as many of them were ripe.

Gibberellic acid suppresses abscission in navel orange, reducing and slowing down
chlorophyll degradation, ultimately delaying fruit senescence and harvesting period, thus
this increased packouts during postharvest and market outtums (Linhout et al., 2008).
Additionally, according to Sahu et al. (2020), foliar application of GA; found maximum
fruit retention in mango. Fruit retention up to maturity might be due to proper

supplementation of the nutrients and prevention in the formation of an abscission layer.

Peel color. At the end of the on-tree storage period, fruits treated with 40 ppm of
GAs significantly (P<.0001) maintained the green peel color (2.33) while fruits in untreated

control changed to yellow with trace of green color (5.03) as shown in Table 3.

Control fruits were the earliest to change in peel color after 7 days, followed by
fruits treated with 10 and 20 ppm treatment on the 28" day. The effect of second application
of GAs on the fruits with color break did not revert to green, and the color change increased
as it reached 49 days of on-tree storage. The fruits with 40 ppm of GAs that was harvested
on 70" day of on-tree storage started to change in color (Figure 14A). Figures 14B-D shows

the changes in peel color as affected by GAs application during on-tree storage.

Figure 15 shows the number of fruits in percent as affected by GAs treatment using
the yellowing or color index that was obtained from Postharvest Horticulture Training and
Research Center (PHTRC). Fruits treated with 40 ppm of GAs was at color index category
2 (green colors with a trace of yellow), about 85%, Fruits without GAs and fruits with 10
ppm were in color index category 5 (yellow with trace of green) and color index category
3 (more green than yellow) with both 47% correspondingly. Moreover, 30% of control
fruits were classified under color index category 6 (fully orange fruits).

Exogenous application of GA3 has an inhibitory effect in ripening or maturation
which delays the anthocyanin synthesis and decrease in respiration as well as reduction of
enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), chlorophyllase and peroxidase
activities involved in chlorophyll metabolism (Alferez et al., 2021). Thus, this results in
the delay of degreening in citrus fruits and managing harvesting periods when applied

before the onset of color break. Foliar application of GA3 prevents fruit ripening, retards


fruit aging, and ultimately maintains the green peel color during on-tree storage before

harvest season.

Figure 15. Number of calamansi fruits per color index as
affected by gibberellic acid after 70 days of on-
tree storage
Peel color is the most essential and reliable ripening index in mandarin fruits. Pre-

harvest treatment of 30 ppm GAs treated fruits resulted in a significant delay in the rind

color development as well as delay in the maturity in mandarin (Rokaya et al., 2016). In

kumauat citrus fruit, application of 20 ppm GAs led to a significantly higher hue (H°) value
and increased chromaticity (C°) value, thus reducing the rate of degreening and delayed
fruit color break during on- tree storage. Furthermore, an increase in the citrus color index
(CCI) was also inhibited, indicating the lightness (L) of peel could be retained by GA3 (Cai
et al., 2022).

Peel thickness. Peel thickness was significantly (P= 0.01) affected by the

application of GA3, Control fruits had thicker peels compared to treated fruits after 70 days


of storage (Table 4). Fruits sprayed with 40 ppm and 20 ppm GAs had thinner peels,
measuring 0.70 mm and 0.69 mm, respectively. The same effect was also reported that peel
thickness and weight were lower in treated Sunburst fruits (Pozo et al., 2000) and pummelo
cultivars (Wang et al., 2019) during on-tree storage. During fruit development, GA3-treated
fruits moderately increased in peel thickness but decreased during maturation,
demonstrating that GAs delayed fruit aging.

In addition, the reduced peel thickness resulted in an increased peel puncture force,
indicating higher peel firmness. The total peel fresh weight increased during maturation.
However, GAs slowed down and reduced the increase of peel thickness and weight during
fruit maturation, subsequently increasing the pulp weight. As a result, significantly delayed
decrease in pulp/ peel ratio in mandarin. Delaying peel and rind senescence improves fruit

quality, prolongs the shelf life of fruit, and extends its value (Ismail, 1997).

Rind ageing. Rind ageing was estimated as the percent of fruit with peel pitting
(see Figure 16). Peel pitting is a disorder characterized with a sunken area of flavedo (called
pits) that eventually spreads and affects the oil glands (Alferez et al., 2004). Rind ageing
was prominent in untreated fruits with 77.50% occurrence while only 30% was observed
in fruits applied with 40 ppm GAs.

According to Postharvest Horticulture Training and Research Center (PHTRC),
quality of calamansi fruits can be evaluated using visual quality rating (VQR), the untreated
fruits were mostly under VQR categories 3-5, which were in fair and poor peel appearance,
moderate and minor defects, and limit of marketability. The fruits in 40 ppm were observed

to be in VQR categories 8-9, categorized as excellent and field fresh fruits, while fruits in

a7

10 ppm and 20 ppm were under VQR categories 6-7 as good and has a minor defect
condition. Only 40 ppm was the only acceptable in consumer preference among all
treatments in evaluating the external visual appearance. Additionally, mature, whole, firm,
fresh, free from superficial defects such as discoloration, mechanical damage, pests, and

diseases are the standard qualities for grading and classification in calamansi fruits (PNS-

Cee

Figure 16. Peel pitting in control calamansi fruits after on-tree
storage.

DA, 2005).

Application of GAs prevents the growth of peel thickness which delays fruit ageing
and maintains firmness during maturation. Similar observation from Kassem et al. (2012)
experiment, all foliar sprays recorded a significant decrease in rind ageing percentage (GAs
and combination of PUT, Ca, and except 2, 4-D alone). Thus, the percentage of rind
softening, and pitting was decreased by foliar sprays of GAs.

The application of GAs at the mature stage is mainly for maintaining and enhancing
extemal fruit qualities (Zekri, 2011). External fruit disorders such as peel pitting, browning
and shriveled are critical in consumers’ acceptance and preference. According to Barrette
et al. (2010), characteristics that provide distinctive quality of fruits and vegetables are

described by color and appearance as the first attributes, followed by flavor (taste and


aroma), taste, and nutritional value. Consumers tend to evaluate the extemal visual
appearance more than internal qualities. Nutritional value is a hidden quality attribute and
is only evaluated after consumption.

So fresh external appearance of fruits is the first parameter evaluated by consumers
in the market. Maintaining extemal qualities such as green peel color, disease-free, pecl is
not shriveled and sunken, additionally, no browning in rind for a more extended period of

storage is advantageous and could give a higher marketable price.

Fruit weight and diameter. Gibberellic acid has no significant effect on fruit weight
and diameter after on-tree storage (Table 4). However, fruits treated with all GA3
treatments have heavier weight compared to control. Application of 40 ppm of GA3
recorded the maximum fruit weight of 223.3 g and the least weight was found in control
fruits (177 g). Probably, the relatively higher CV of 13.55 was responsible for the non-
significant effect on fruit weight.

Other workers with citrus on-tree storage reported an increase in fruit weight after
GAs application. Pozo et al. (2000) reported that 25 ppm of GAs applied on full trees (stage
of fruits not recorded), fruit weight of mandarin increased until 60 days after application.
Also, El-Rahman et al., (2017) found that when sprayed with 10 and 20 ppm of GAs during
color break on mandarins, fruit weight gradually increased as harvest period proceeded up
to 3" harvest then decreased in 4" harvest. Furthermore, GA3 with a concentration of 10
to 20 ppm was the most effective treatment for fruit growth in mandarin applied at fruit

color break (Rokaya et al., 2016).

Talat et al. (2020) stated the length and width of Kinnow mandarin fruits were
improved with the foliar application of 65 ppm GAs during a pre-harvest stage; however,
the size of fruits when sprayed was not reported. Limequat fruits sprayed with 15 ppm of
GAs at the onset of the cell expansion stage were recorded to have maximum fruit diameter
compared when sprayed after 21 days of the cell expansion stage (Shah et al., 2017). In
strawberry, Thakur et al. (2017) also observed that fruits sprayed with gibberellic acid
resulted in highest fruit length, breadth, and weight.

The higher fruit growth with GA3-treated fruits might be due to mediating process
for faster translocation and mobilization of photosynthates from the source. It is well-
known that gibberellic acid induces cell elongation, increased organ size therefore
stimulating cell division. According to Lara (2013), gibberellic acid is a pentacyclic

diterpene acid that promotes plant growth and elongation.


Juice content. All GAs treatments had no significant effect (P= 0.60) on juice
content percent (Table 4). Gibberellic acid enhanced the extemal qualities such as delayed
rind ageing, prevent browning and peel pitting, thus, water loss from the fruit during on -
tree storage was minimal. this is because the pulp walls were well preserved in the GAs
treated fruit rind softening was inhibited. Because peel thickness was decreased during
maturation, juice content was maintained and preserved, this made the fruit firmer until

harvest season.

Fruit firmness. Fruits treated with 40 ppm of GA3 have a higher valuc (2.64
kg/cm’) of fruit firmness than the control (1.61 kg/cm’). All the GAs-treated fruits
maintained fruit firmness at harvest (Table 4). This observation is consistent with other
studies done on citrus. Foliar application of GAs at 10, 20 and 30 ppm applied at color
break of mandarin have higher levels of peel firmness. Fruits with 20 ppm of GAs proved
to have higher peel puncture resistance during fruit growth (El-Rahman ct al., 2017; Zekri,
2011). Because during senescence of fruit, the cell wall becomes loosened, making the fruit
soften as the fruits aged. This decreases the fruit’s firmness. Foliar application of GA; at
color break reduced the percent of fruit softening. The pro-pectin, which acts as a
cementing material for binding the cellulose and hemicelluloses, is converted to soluble
pectin, which loosens the cell wall’s binding force during ripening. GAs increased juice
extraction efficiency because the increased peel firmness provides better mechanical

support for the fruit (Rokaya et al., 2016).


Total Soluble Solids. Application of GA3 significantly (P=0. 002) affected the total
sugar of fruits after 70 days of on-tree storage as shown in Table 5. The value of soluble
solids in control fruits (0.78 Brix) was higher than in GA3-treated fruits, while same values
were attained by all GA3-treated fruits (0.70 °Brix). This result is to be expected as the
control fruits were already very ripe (see Fig 14A), and TSS increases in ripe fruits whereas
ripening was retarded in GA3-treated fruits. According to Jadhao et al. (2008), the soluble
sugars in control had a rapid increase than in other treatments, and this might be due to a
faster metabolic activity through respiration and transpiration. The increase in soluble
sugars during storage indicates loss of moisture, hydrolysis of polysaccharides, and

concentrations of juice because of dehydration.

As the aim of this study was to see if the availability of green mature fruits can be
extended and that these fruits are essentially the same as those that did not undergo on-tree
storage, the control here should have been fruits at BBCH 79-80 from untreated or control
trees. Because there were limited available fruits at the time this manuscript was being

written, TSS of control fruits were read and compared from those fruits using the same


methodology. The result showed that TSS content was the same or unaffected when
compared against the GA; treatments (data not shown). Sugar content of fruits increases as
the fruits mature with increasing harvest time. According to Alferez et al. (2021), in non-
climacteric fruits such as citrus, as fruits develop and mature, the level of sugar content and
ABA increases with the onset of ripening. The color change during maturation is the
consequence of reduction in levels of the active gibberellins GA and GAg, which is
involved in the regulation of sugars and ABA accumulation in the rind; moreover, ABA
enhanced the sensitivity of the fruit to ethylene. Ethylene is the stimulant of transcriptional
and biochemical changes that are associated with maturation. Pozo et al. (2000) reported
TSS decreased after foliar treatment of 25 ppm of GA3 on mandarin compared with the
control. GAs inhibited the accumulation of sugar, mainly sucrose, because the increase of

total sugars was due to the ripening phase of the fruits.

Titratable Acidity. The foliar application of GAs did not significantly (p=0.83)
affect the acidity of calamansi fruits (Table 5). Fruits treated with 40 ppm of GAs recorded
3.97 minimum acidity while fruits treated with 30 ppm and 20 ppm of GAs recorded
maximum acidity, 4.20% and 4.10%, respectively. The opposite result was obtained by Cai
et al. (2020) in Kumquat fruit, and Sen et al. (2013) in Satsuma mandarin, acidity in GAs-
sprayed fruits decreased gradually as storage time increased indicating that GAs
application, acidity decreased at the end of on tree storage. Foliar application of GA was
found to promote TA degradation. Nawaz ct al. (2008) also stated that GAs application was

also helpful in reducing acidity in Kinnow mandarin.

CHAPTER V

SUMMARY, CONCLUSION, AND RECOMMENDATIONS

SUMMARY

The reproductive phenology of calamansi trees from flowering to the fruit
development and ripening stage was observed in dry and wet seasons, from February 2021
to December 2021. Phenological observations using the BBCH scale were initially done
during the dry season and repeated in the wet season. Calamansi trees during the wet season
were subjected to different gibberellic acid treatments (T1: control; T2: 10 ppm; T3: 20

ppm, and T4: 40 ppm).

Study I focused on stage 5 (inflorescence emergence) until stage 8 (fruit maturity)
using the BBCH scale. Stage 5 was unaffected by season, with only one day difference.
Stages 6 to 8 were influenced by season, and Stage 6 was extended by two more days
during the dry compared to the wet scason. Fruit development (Stage 7) took a long time
during the wet season, which lasted 62 days during the dry season and 91 days during the
wet season. The fruit maturity stage (Stage 8) took 32 days during the dry season and 44

days during the wet season.

To sum up the total duration of growth stages, it took 94 days from fruit setting
(Stage 7) to reach fruit maturity (Stage 8) during the dry season and 135 days during the

wet season, or 41 days longer. From floral emergence to fruit development or fruits that


did not reach color break yet (Stage 5-7) took 80 days and 108 days in the dry and wet
seasons, respectively. Moreover, it took 112 days from inflorescence emergence (Stage 5)

to fruit maturity (Stage 8) during the dry season and 152 days during the wet season.

It took 111 days and needed 4,314.33 GDD to reach Stage 8 during the dry season.
Stage 7 contributed to the long process (62 days), followed by stage 8 (32 days). On the
other hand, during the wet season, it took 152 days and 3488.83 GDD to reach fruit
maturity, which is considered the beginning of senescence and fruit abscission. The dry
season recorded the highest total accumulated GDD (4,314.33), indicating that increased

temperatures will contribute to increased available heat energy for plant growth.

For the second study, the effects of GAs on extending the green mature stage for
on-tree storage was evaluated. The ideal phenological stage of calamansi to apply GAs was
identified to be BBCH Stage 79-80 or the green mature fruits that have attained full size

and before any color break can be detected.

Fruits treated with initial sprays of 10 and 20 ppm can delay the color change and
harvest the green stage at 28 days in which the physical characteristics are acceptable to
the consumer's visual preference. On the other hand, 40 ppm remained green for up to 46
days and showed no signs of a color break. And this one is crucial because only a one-time
application of 40 ppm could already extend and prolong the shelf life of the mature green

stage for 46 days.

A second application of GA3 was made 46 days after the initial application, when

some fruits started to change in color. The fruits treated with lower concentrations (10 and


20 ppm) did not remain green and color development progressed. In contrast, fruits with
40 ppm of GAs remained green until 56 days, and after another week (63 days), only one-
fourth of the fruits started to change in color and up to 90 % of the fruits were retained
until 70 days of on-tree storage. Moreover, the treatment also significantly decreased peel
thickness, delayed rind ageing, and made it firmer. Additionally, the total soluble solids

(TSS) and Titratable acidity (TA) were unaffected.

In summary, all GAs treatments successfully extended and maintained the mature
green stage (BBCH scale 79-80) of calamansi fruits by 28 to 56 days and when extended
for another week, only one-fourth had color break. It was 40 ppm of GA3 exhibited the best
results among other treatments in all the parameters examined. It was clear that GAs only
slowed down chlorophyll degradation, not inhibited it. Thus, the fruit has also delayed
ageing or maturation of calamansi fruits. It was ideal and recommended to harvest the fruits
before or until 63 days after treatment because fruits in this period were still green but

showed color break.


CONCLUSION

The ideal stage for applying gibberellic acid is when the fruits had reached BBCH
Scale 79-80, about 90-100% (around 23-27 mm) of their final size with no color break
visible. This stage can also be identified by counting 108 days from inflorescence
emergence during the wet season. It was ascertained that the duration of flower and fruit

development stages varied with the season.

All concentrations of GA3 were proven to successfully extend the green stage of
calamansi fruits by 28 to 56 days. A one-time application of GA; extends the mature green
stage for a month in fruits treated with 10 and 20 ppm, with less than 17.5% of fruits at
color break. In contrast, fruits treated with 40 ppm extended the green mature stage for 46
days with initial spray and a second application further extended the effect up to 63 days
with only one-fourth (27.5%) having a color break. When sprayed on fruits that had already

undergone color break, the second application did not revert back to green color.

Overall, 40 ppm of GAs showed a better outcome in all GAs treatments with or
without the second spray. GAs at 40 ppm delayed peel color change, slowed down rind
ageing, decreased peel thickness, and maintained fruit firmness. The postharvest quality
of the fruits after two months of on-tree storage was essentially the same as calamansi
fruits harvested immediately since total soluble solids, titratable acidity and fruit firmness
were unaffected by the GA3 treatment . Thus, this study demonstrated that calamansi

fruits can be made available for harvesting in the next two months after the peak season


by on-tree storage. Consequently, harvesting can be made during the lean scason and

calamansi growers can expect to sell the fruits at a higher farm gate price because of this

technology.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Accordingly, the following recommendations are formulated:

1.

GAs can be applied as foliar spray 108 days after inflorescence emergence during
the wet season, or when the fruits tum dark green, the peel is porous, and around

90-100 % (23-27 mm) of their final size.

. The lower concentrations of 20 ppm of GAs; can be used for short term on-tree

storage lasting for 35 days. This is suitable for trees with fruits ready for harvesting

mid to late September and the grower wants to reach the October harvesting date.

. The highest dose of 40 ppm GAs is more effective for longer on-tree storage of up

to 46 days with a single application. A second application can be advised to extend
on-tree storage for up to two months. This can be effective for trees with harvestable
fruits in August and intended for harvest in October or for trees with harvestable

fruit in September and intended for a November harvest.
