ABSTRACT

Microplastic pollution poses a significant environmental challenge, causing
damage to natural processes. Its widespread occurrence is attributed to the extensive
use of plastics across various sectors. Effective measures to minimize plastic's
environmental impact are lacking. Its extent remains to be evaluated to include risks
to human health. Microplastic pollution was assessed by microscopy and FTIR
techniques in gut fish samples from Tacloban City market. Data from this study is
essential to assess microplastic human exposure. The study chose the top five highly
purchased fish in the city, Chanos chanos, Sardinella spp., Decapterus spp.,
Rastrelliger brachysoma, and Rastrelliger faughni. Results revealed that
microplastics are present in all these fish. Among the 25 samples per fish species
collected from three major markets in the city, 12±6.5 samples of Rastrelliger
faughni, 9±2 samples of Chanos chanos, 8±1.53 samples Sardinella spp. 8±1.53
samples of Decapterus spp., and 741.53 samples of Rastrelliger brachysoma contain
microplastics in their guts. Raustrelliger faughni has the highest average number of
10.67±2.9 microplastics, followed by Chanos chanos with 9.67±1.86, Sardinella spp.
5±1, Decapterus spp. 3±0.57, and Rastrelliger brachysoma 2.33±0.46. The
predominant types of microplastics identified were tibers, followed by film, pellets,
and fragments. The FTIR analysis indicates that encountered polymers were cellulose
propionate, HDPE, EPDM, and polyacetal. Various colors and shapes were observed,
with elongated shapes being prominent and orange as the prevailing color. Tacloban
City Market stands out for selling fish with the highest concentration of microplastics
in the guts of its sold fishes followed by Caibaan Market and San Fernando having
fish with the least detected microplastics. A KAP survey was done to provide insights into the knowledge, attitudes, and
perceptions of local communities in Tacloban City regarding microplastics. The
respondents, who were mostly young and educated adults, gained knowledge about
microplastics from personal experiences. They had a positive attitude towards
reducing plastic pollution and recognized the importance of coastal waters. With a
significant number of people who are still willing to consume fish with microplastics,
it is recommended to raise awareness about the potential health risks associated with
consuming fish containing microplastics and promote sustainable practices to reduce
plastic pollution in order to mitigate the ingestion of microplastics through seafood
consumption.Future research should explore sustainable alternatives to single-use
plastics, conduct broader social surveys, compare microplastics in sediments and
water, and investigate the accumulation of microplastics in fish muscle tissues.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background and rationale

Plastic pollution is one of the major environmental problems of our society.
This issue continuously escalates some environmental processes that cannot be
reversed. One of the major products that plastic pollution has brought about is
microplastic pollution. Plastic has become widely popular due to its durability and
cheap cost. Almost all aspects of the society rely on plastics, such as wraps, water
bottles, and packaging of non-recyclable goods. With the increasing population that
is almost dependent on plastics, plastic pollution has become rampant in our
environment.

Microplastics (MP) are tiny plastic particles with a size range of 1-15 cm
(10-150 mm), >5 mm and anywhere from 2.5 to 100 cm (25-1,000 mm) (Hartman et
al., 2019) that are formed either through human activities or exposure of larger
plastics to natural elements. These minuscule particles can infiltrate various
ecosystems, posing a potential threat to the organisms within those systems. The size
can vary greatly, ranging from less than 0.2 inches to particles measured in
nanometers There are two main types of microplastics: primary and secondary.
Primary microplastics originate from commercial products like cosmetics,
microfibers, and fishing nets, while secondary microplastics are formed when larger
plastic items, such as water bottles, break down due to environmental factors
(National Geographic, 2022).

It is worth noting that microplastics smaller than Smm in size have a high
dispersal capability (Horton, 2020). Over time, they have been discovered to

accumulate in the seafloor, either by sinking through the water column or indirectly

through ocean currents (Clark ef al., 2016). Interestingly, the proximity of a town or
city to the seabed has been found to significantly influence the presence of
microplastics in the seafloor (Clark ef al., 2016).

The issue of microplastics extends beyond the marine environment and affects
various ecosystems worldwide. They can enter freshwater systems, terrestrial habitats,
and even the air we breathe. Additionally, microplastics have been found to adsorb
and transport harmful chemicals further increasing the potential risks they pose to
both wildlife and human health (Wright & Kelly, 2017). Understanding the sources,
distribution, and impacts of microplastics is crucial for developing effective
mitigation strategies and reducing their pervasive presence in our environment.

Microplastics smaller than 1 micrometer in size can negatively impact the
cellular system and tissues of organisms through irvitation due to their foreign
presence (Lim, 2021). They closely resemble the size of zooplankton, causing marine
life to mistake them for food. Consequently, the reproductive and photosynthetic
processes of algae, which form the foundation of the food chain, can be disrupted
(Mao ef al., 2018). This disruption can have far-reaching consequences, especially in
regions like the Antarctic, where the ecosystem heavily relies on seasonal production
of nutrients (Waller e al., 2017).

Ingestion of larger microplastics poses a greater risk that could lead to
intoxication. For instance, birds that feed on insects have been found to consume up to
200 pieces of plastic per day (D’Souza ef a/., 2020), When these plastics are ingested,
compounds such as plasticizers, stabilizers, and pigments present in the plastics can
interfere with hormone production in the endocrine system (Lou ef al., 2022).

Additionally, the ingestion of microplastics can result in reduced metabolic activity

(Horton & Barnes, 2020). These harmful effects highlight the significant impact that
microplastics can have on both individual organisms and broader ecosystems.

The health impacts of consuming fish contaminated with microplastics is an
emerging area of research, and our understanding of the specific effects is still
evolving. However, some potential health concerns associated with the ingestion of
microplastics through contaminated fish include chemical exposure. Microplastics can
adsorb and concentrate toxic chemicals from the surrounding environment. When fish
consume microplastics, these chemicals can be released and potentially enter the body
of the consumer (Alberghini ef ai/., 2023). Some of these chemicals include
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP),
octylphenol (OP), and potentially toxic elements, which may have adverse health
effects when accumulated in the body over time.

Microplastic ingestion can also cause tissue damage and inflammatory
response. The presence of microplastics in fish tissues can trigger an immune
response, leading to chronic inflammation. Prolonged inflammation may contribute to
various health issues, including oxidative stress, consequent inflammatory, and other
cytotoxic impacts (Bhuyan, 2022: Albergihini et al., 2023).

Fish that are contaminated with microplastics may be consumed by larger
marine organisms, including humans, and can transfer microplastics up the food
chain. This can lead to the biomagnification of microplastics and their associated
contaminants within the food chain, potentially increasing exposure and health risks
for consumers at higher trophic levels (Miller ef a/., 2020).

At a local perspective, research conducted by Cabansag et al. (2021) on
microplastics found in several fish in Eastern Visayas, Philippines, showed that

herbivores such as S. canaliculatus, are more prone to consuming more microplastics

in comparison to detritivores like mullets, S. canaliculatus. Fibers are a form of
microplastic that are frequently seen in both herbivore and omnivore species. The
study also discovered that marine fish species consume food at a higher pace than
freshwater fish species.

According to the study's findings of Yu et al. (2022), microplastics are found
in Perna viridis and Venerupis species, which are mostly polyamide fibers, high
density polyethylene (HDPE), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The survey
interview also showed that the respondents lacked basic knowledge on MP. However,
the respondents demonstrated a positive attitude toward reducing plastic pollution and
valued coastal waters. The study also calculated an estimate of the amount of MP that
can be transferred to humans through consumption of bivalves, which was found to be
0.003 mg/day.

Experts and scholars have voiced apprehension about the potential
environmental repercussions of microplastics. They acknowledge that there remains a
substantial knowledge gap, necessitating further in-depth examination and study. The
increasing prevalence of microplastics in the ecosystem has instilled profound
concern about its future implications and the welfare of forthcoming generations.
Consequently, ongoing efforts are underway to explore and research the
characteristics of plastics and their effects comprehensively.

1.2 Statement of the Problem

The Philippines highly rely on marine resources, especially fishes, as a main
source of livelihood, income generation, and consumption. According to the United
States Department of Agriculture (2022), with an annual per capita consumption of 40
kgl, fish is the most consumed animal protein in the Philippines. This translates to a

market demand for 4.4 million MT, which is worth $3 trillion. However, the

Philippine oceans are facing environmental degradation due to mismanaged wastes
from different sources.

Philippines, including other Southeast Asian countries, is at the top five for the
most plastic-polluting states (Garcia e/ al., 2019). With the ubiquity of plastics in the
marine environment, this poses risk and other hazards to both the human society and
the natural ecosystem. Macroplastics weather overtime into microscopic fragments
sizing into <Smm through physical or chemical agents (Carber er al., 2018). These
microscopic fragments of plastics are mistaken by fishes and other marine animals as
a food source, consequently entering their bodies. Plastics are known to increase their
toxicity levels through the adsorption of harmful chemicals, such as bisphenol A,
polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic hydrocarbons, and polybromodiphenyl ethers.
This process disrupts the immediate biota (Superio & Abreo, 2020).

Microplastics is a global issue that exposes different risks to mankind and the
environment. However, further research is still needed to fully understand its nature
and effects. Specifically, there is no sufficient data about microplastics in fish sold in
Tacloban City markets that one could fully circumscribe about its presence and
effects.

Considering the thriving fishing industry in Leyte, it is plausible that the
general populace has been inadvertently ingesting microplastics through the
consumption of commercially available marine products, including but not limited to
fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and similar seafood items. Several research studies have
indicated the occurrence of microplastics in certain marine resources. In the study of
Cabansag et al. (2021), mullets and rabbitfishes collected in Cancabato Bay in
Tacloban City are found to have microplastics in their guts in the forms of fibers,

fragments, foam, pellets and microbeads. Additionally, the study of Yu ef al. (2022) in

Perna viridis and Venerupis spp. also collected in Cancabato Bay are found to have
ingested microplastics such as polyamide fibers, HDPE, and PVDF. The main
distinction between this study and the ones previously stated is that it aims to
determine the presence of microplastics in fish that are sold in Tacloban City's market
where most of the populace buy fish for consumption. With the use of scientifically
structured questionnaires the populace’s level of awareness, attitudes, and practices on

microplastics and behavior towards plastic pollution is determined as well.

1.3 Objectives
The primary objective of this study is to determine the presence of
microplastics in commercially sold fishes in Tacloban City and the awareness of the
locals about microplastics and plastic pollution. Specifically, it aims:
1. To examine gut contents of commercially sold fishes for the presence of
microplastics;
2. To determine which species of fish are with most microplastics in their guts;
and
3. To determine the level of knowledge and awareness of the locals about
microplastics, their attitude towards plastic pollution, and their practices.
1.4 Significance of the Study
With the determination of microplastics in commercially sold fishes in the
markets of Tacloban City, this study may help bolster the proper management of
plastic wastes and consequently diminish cases of microplastic contamination. This
study will contribute to the research community and provide recent information since
there is minimal data regarding microplastic pollution in commercially sold fishes in

the Philippines, specifically, Tacloban City.

According to Macleod ef al. (2021), adverse effects of plastic pollution
include irreversible alterations in the carbon and nutrient cycle, changes in the
mechanics in the ecosystem, co-occurring biological consequences on endangered and
keystone species, rise of toxicity in the environment, and other societal impacts.
Through the KAP (Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices) survey this study will provide
additional information for a better policy making and strengthened implementation of

a proper plastic waste disposal in the city.

1.5 Conceptual Framework

Figure | shows the research paradigm which is geared on policy formulation
with regards to human exposure to microplastics. This is obtained through the
collection of fish samples originating from the markets of Tacloban City that are
commercially sold for consumption.

The samples are analyzed through microscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR). The microscopy method enables the determination of presence
of microplastics in the guts of the collected fishes. The FTIR determines the type of
microplastics found. The assessment of presence or absence provides an estimated
human exposure to microplastics including but is not limited to toxicity. Additionally,
the research utilizes a Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) survey that tackles
the knowledge, attitude, and perception of the locals about microplastics. It provides
an overview of Tacloban City’s level of awareness on microplastics.

With the increasing utilization of plastics in society, plastic pollution has
become rampant in the environment. Through this research, additional data regarding
the matter is crucial in the formulation of policies and other societal mechanisms to

control the increase of microplastics and aid in the preservation of the environment.

1.6 Scope and Limitation of the Study

The scope of this study was limited to Tacloban City, focusing exclusively on
fish available for consumption in its local markets. The survey involved residents
currently residing in Tacloban City and those observed purchasing fish commodities
from its markets. It is important to note that the study primarily explores probable
sources of fish rather than tracing the precise origin of the samples, as they were
collected from the markets. As a result, the study's findings should be interpreted with

consideration for these specific constraints.

CHAPTER 2
REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

2.1 Macroplastics to microplastics

In a study conducted by Jambeck e/ al. (2015), it was revealed that China
ranked first in terms of global plastic waste generation, with Indonesia and the
Philippines following in second and third place, respectively. The Philippines
produced approximately 2.7 million metric tons of plastic waste in 2015, whereas
China's plastic waste production during the same year was approximately 48.1 million
metric tons. Despite China's higher overall plastic waste production, the Philippines is
the country that contributes the most plastic waste to the world's oceans.

This is primarily due to the fact that a significant portion of the Philippines’
population resides in coastal regions and near rivers and canals. Coastal cities, such as
Metro Manila, which have paved surfaces, urban drainage systems, and experience
high levels of precipitation, have been identified as major sources of land-based
plastic waste that ends up in the oceans. Meijer ef al. (2021) conducted a study and
found that Pasig River, located in Metro Manila, contributes the largest amount of
marine plastic waste. This river alone accounts for 6.43 percent of all plastic waste
found in the oceans.

Single-use plastics are widely prevalent in the Philippines, primarily because
of their affordability, durability, easy accessibility, and efficient production process.
This surge in plastic consumption has led to significant environmental concerns. A
major contributing factor to this issue is the mass production of consumer goods
packaged in plastic, which particularly affects low-income households. In order to

afford essential items like shampoo, hair conditioner, and soap, these households often

opt for purchasing them in small sachets rather than in bulk quantities, as the former is
significantly cheaper and more affordable (del Pilar e/ a/., 2020)

Furthermore, the use of single-use plastics extends to the food industry, where
products are frequently packaged in disposable plastics or cellophane wrappers.
Additionally, disposable cups, forks, spoons, and other utensils are commonly used
for eating purposes (Bates, 2019). Such practices contribute to the mounting plastic
waste in the country.

The medical sector also heavily relies on plastic materials. Disposable gloves,
wraps for medical equipment, plastic syringes and vials, face masks, face shields, and
other items are extensively used in healthcare facilities (Leal Filho ef al., 2021). Due
to the risk of contamination, these items cannot be reused and are immediately
discarded after use, further exacerbating the plastic waste problem. The widespread
use of single-use plastics in various sectors of the Philippines, including consumer
goods, food packaging, and the medical industry, has resulted in a significant
environmental challenge, as these plastics are often disposed of and cannot be reused
due to contamination concerns.

The Philippines has a significant problem with the excessive production and
usage of plastics, coupled with ineffective waste management practices. As a result,
these plastics have infiltrated various natural environments, including water systems
like rivers, lakes, and oceans. Over time, the large plastic items exposed to UV rays
and other environmental factors undergo degradation and break down into tiny
particles known as microplastics measuring less than five millimeters in diameter

(Nematdoost Haghi and Banaee, 2017; National Ocean Service, n.d.).


2.2 Impacts of microplastics to the environment

Microplastics pose varying degrees of risks to both marine and freshwater
ecosystems compared to macroplastics due to its pervasiveness and mainly to its size.
The process of degradation makes plastics more readily available and exposes a
greater variety of species in marine settings. This can be discerned in the presence of
microplastics in various trophic levels, including fish (Neves ef a/. 2015; Bellas ef al.
2016), crustaceans (Goldstein et a/., 2013), and zooplankton (Desforges et al. 2015)
Additionally, biofouling—a process in which biofilms develop on plastic surfaces and
change waste or other particles into a substance that trophic consumers mistake for
food—led to an increase in the frequency of ingestion (Kooi et a/., 2017).

Microplastics have tendencies to increase the toxicity level in the water
through adsorption of chemicals such as bisphenol A, polychlorinated biphenyls,
polycyclic hydrocarbons, polybromodiphenyl ethers that may affect the intermediate
biota (Superio & Abreo, 2020). In the study of Avio ef al. (2015), showed that
polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics in mussels absorb polycyclic
hydrocarbons which then accumulate in its tissues. Due to the exposure of high
concentration of pyrene, the mussels reportedly have changes in its immunological
response and gene expressions. In addition, because microplastics obstruct
photosynthetic processes through algal adsorption and aggregation, algae growth is
often inhibited (Zhang et al., 2015)

Distribution of microplastics in the natural environment is not only limited to
marine and aquatic ecosystems, but can also be observed in atmospheric pathway
distribution (Superio & Abreo, 2020; Dris e# al., 2015). This further means that
microplastic pollution can occur even in remote areas. Far-reaching rivers and lakes

may be contaminated with microplastics due to its nature of distribution.

Studying microplastics is crucial for ensuring food security since freshwater
and marine environments are significant sources of fish and other creatures that could
serve as a food supply for inland settlements. The toxicology of microplastics
demonstrates that, after ingestion, the toxins they produce eventually accumulate in
the tissues (Avio ef al., 2015). It is also probable that trophic transfer will increase the
biomagnification of plastics and the poisons emitted by plastics, making freshwater

and marine fishes unfit for human food (Ziccardi ef al., 2016).

2.3 Characterization of microplastics

The characterization of microplastics involve sample collection, preservation
of sample without contamination, digestion of samples with specific reagents to
remove unwanted biomass and other interferences, incubation of samples, filtration of
samples to extract microplastics, analysis of samples through microscopy and FTIR
Spectrometry.

In the study of Abijion et al. (2020), the characterization of microplastics from
the sample follows the same pattern as stated above. Specifically, sample collection
was done following the Rochman ef al. (2015) protocol through securing the fish
samples in an aluminum foil, putting it in zip lock bags, and freezing it to avoid
contamination. The guts were then extracted from the fish samples under the laminar
flow cabinet and lab apparatuses were washed several times with distilled water to
prevent contamination. The gastrointestinal tract of the fishes were isolated from the
fish through cutting lengthwise from the belly to the anus and was weighed in a tared
jar. Technical graded powdered NaOH (Sodium Hydroxide) and SDS (Sodium
Dodecyl Sulphate) were dissolved in (5g/L) distilled water. Per 1 g of fish tissue, 10

mL of NaOH and 5 mL of SDS 0.5% were added to the jar as part of the digestion


process. It is then incubated for 24 hours at 50°C in the oven, followed by another 24
hours of incubation after the jars are gently shaken. The jars were rinsed three times
with 95% ethanol and Milli-Q water after the incubation period, and the contents were
vacuum filtered using a 0.45 m filter membrane. After 5 minutes, 10 mL of technical
2M HCI was added, and the mixture was washed with distilled water. In the same
manner as HCl, 30% hydrogen peroxide was used to remove any remaining organic
compounds. A filter paper was used to contain the microplastics, which was then
examined under a microscope. The stereomicroscope and the hot needle technique
were used to identify and confirm the microplastics that were put in a petri dish
coated with filter sheets. A suspected microplastic was pricked with a heated thin
needle under a stereomicroscope as part of the hot needle process.

In addition, in the study of Cabansag ef al. (2021) entitled Microplastics in
some fish species and their environs in Eastern Visayas, Philippines, fish samples
were placed in a sealed container and then iced and frozen within two hours to three
hours from capture. All of the tools used to dissect, digest, and prepare samples were
constructed of glass or ceramic to reduce sample contamination. Laboratory supplies
were properly cleaned, rinsed with distilled water several times, air dried inverted,
and stored inverted when not in use. Fish guts were immediately placed in clean
graduated cylinders for volume measurement after being removed from various fish
species. As a control experiment, the experimental procedure without any
gastrointestinal tissues was also carried out. The whole digestive system, including
the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, was dissolved in three times the volume of
each GI tract's 10% KOH (Potassiwn Hydroxide) solution and incubated for 12 to 24
hours at 60°C. The displacement method was used to calculate the digestive system's

volume. The remaining material was then filtered through a series of sieves,


measuring 4000 m, 250 m, and 150 m, before being put into the oven. The residual

components were then transferred to clean petri plates after being filtered through a

125 m filter paper by washing it with minimal distilled water. A Wild Heer-Brugg

MSA stereomicroscope was used to visually check the particles that had been

retained.

Qualitative and quantitative methodologies work jointly in the characterisation

of microplastics. Hidalgo-Ruz ef al. (2012) claim that there is a vast variety of

microplastics with different forms, sizes, and origins because of the diversity of

sources. The following table summarizes the characterization and description of

microplastics adapted from Hidalgo-Ruz et al. (2012).

In the study of microplastics, microscopy does not necessarily provide the
reliability and precision in identifying the type of plastic present. Thus, a
much-advanced technology to correctly identify the microplastic is needed. The FTIR
Spectroscopy is a commonly used equipment for the detection of the microplastics
identity (Veerasingam, 2020). It is useful and trustworthy for identifying polymers
and evaluating the quality of plastic products. The changes in the chemical bond
structures of microplastics (hydroxyl, carbonyl groups, and carbon-oxygen atoms) as
a result of various weathering processes are also studied using the FTIR technique
(Veerasingam, 2020). Additionally, the FTIR approach is employed to comprehend
the cellular-level biochemical alterations caused by ingested microplastics, their

related contaminants, and their ecological impacts (Veerasingam 2020).

2.4 Microplastics in the Philippines

Microplastics have become one of the most pressing environmental issues.
However, it is also one of the most understudied aspects concerning environmental
preservation. The effects of microplastics on different aquatic life and other
environmental components needs to be further studied (Arcadio ef al., 2022)
especially its mechanisms and varying movements in the ecosystem. Additionally,
there are very few or no publications regarding microplastics in the freshwater

ecosystem which raises further concerns considering that the pollution levels in rivers,


streams, and lakes are almost comparable to that in marine settings (Superio & Abreo,
2020)

Furthermore, some studies show that microplastics can pose different risks to
organisms exposed to it. Microplastics with a size smaller than 1 mm may cause an
adverse effect on an organism's reproductive system and may irritate an organism's
cellular system and tissues merely by being present especially when exposed to
plasticizers, stabilizers, and pigment while larger microplastics are more likely to
harm by ingesting and being intoxicated (Jin et al., 2021; Lim, 2021).

Arcadio ef al. (2022) first documented evidence on the largest lake in the
Philippines, demonstrated that Laguna Lake is contaminated with microplastics
especially in study sites festered with human activities. Additionally, all microplastics
that have been observed originated from the surrounding communities mostly being
polypropylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, and polyethylene terephthalate. The
microplastics present pose high risks in decreasing water quality and contaminate
aquaculture by entering the food chain which consequently exposes humans to the
effects of microplastics.

The study of Abifion ef al. (2020), showed that microplastics are ubiquitous in
commercially sold fishes in the public wet market of Cebu. Chanos chanos,
commonly known as milkfish or “bangus” are more susceptible to microplastic
ingestion with an average of 11.6 pieces ingested per individual, followed by the
bullet tuna (Auxis rochei) with 6.6 pieces ingested per ingested, and mackerel
(Rastrelliger kanagurta) with an average of 5.3 pieces. The study showed that
transparent microfibers type of microplastic comprising 91% of the total sample is
predominant with the blue color (48%) being mostly observed followed by red (39%),

black (8%), and white (5%).

The study of Cabansag ef al. (2021) regarding the microplastics present in
some fishes and their environs in Eastern Visayas, Philippines, demonstrated that
herbivores represented by S. canaliculatus is more susceptible to ingesting larger
amounts of microplastics compared to detritivore such as mullets. The type of
microplastics that is commonly present are fibers which are observed in both
herbivore and detritivore species which also includes fibers, fragments, foam, pellets
and microbeads. Additionally, the study found that the marine fishes species have
higher ingestion rate compared to freshwater fishes.

The results of the study by Yu ef a/. (2022) show that microplastics are present
in Perna viridis and Venerupis species, along with polyamide fibers, HDPE, and
PVDF. The interview portion of the survey revealed that the respondents lacked
fundamental knowledge about microplastics. The respondents did, however, show a
favorable attitude about lessening plastic pollution and appreciated coastal waters.
The study also estimated that bivalves can transmit 0.003 mg/day of microplastic to
humans, which was shown to be the quantity that can be transferred.

The escalating global problem of microplastic pollution has gained significant
attention as an environmental concern. Expanding research efforts in the field of
microplastics holds the potential to unlock substantial knowledge and insights for
future investigations. Moreover, delving deeper into the study of microplastics
specifically in the context of the Philippines can shed light on an additional dimension
of this issue. Such research can uncover unique aspects, including the sources,
distribution patterns, impacts, and mitigation strategies specific to the Philippines,
thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of microplastic pollution

on a global scale.

2.5 Microplastics and the human society

The effects of microplastics are still to be fully understood (Jin e¢ al., 2021;
Lim 2021; Abifion ed al., 2020, Veerasingam, 2020). However, some studies have
exhibited that microplastics are capable of intoxication through adsorption and higher
tendencies of biomagnification through ingestion in the food chain. (Avio ef al.,
2015).

Only a few social survey researches have delved at plastic use and pollution in
the Philippines. The Social Weather Stations (SWS) conducted a survey on plastic
pollution in 2018 that covered how single-use plastics are used and discarded, how
likely respondents are to support a ban on non-biodegradable plastic bags, and and
who are the entities in-charge of reducing plastic pollution. Out of 1,500 respondents
nationwide, the results showed that 66% used SUP as a container for food items, 34%
said they disposed of SUP in trash bins with other types of waste, 79% supported a
proposed bill on a non-biodegradable plastic bag ban, 65% believed that people's
carelessness in throwing and disposing of their garbage is the cause of plastic
pollution, and 69% believed that Filipino citizens are more responsible in reducing
plastic pollution.

Plastic pollution is a significant issue in the Philippines. The Philippines,
along with China, Vietnam, and Indonesia, are usually named as the world's worst
offenders, particularly when it comes to marine plastic pollution. The report created
by the NGO GAIA as part of a campaign to gather information on the use of plastic as
environmentalists advocate for government action to minimize plastic waste, features
startling statistics, such as the nearly 48 million shopping bags used daily nationwide

in the Philippines, or more than 17 billion annually (Pathak, 2023).


A study by Schachter & Karasik (2022) stated that of the 2.7 million metric
tons of plastic trash produced annually, the Philippines is the third-largest producer of
plastic waste in the world . Furthermore, it is believed that 20% of this plastic garbage
leaks into marine habitats. In open dumps close to susceptible rivers, over 74% of
plastics that leak into the ocean were previously collected but escaped. The issue of
plastic pollution in the Philippines has worsened due to the expansion of the "sachet
economy," wherein numerous consumer products are imported, packaged, and sold in
disposable containers that are difficult or impossible to recycle. Reports suggest that
the Philippines consumes approximately 60 billion sachets each year. Despite efforts
made by lawmakers and activist groups, as of 2021, there is no comprehensive
national policy or strategy in place to address plastic pollution. While a few cities and
municipalities have implemented regulations to control the usage of plastic bags and
other single-use plastics within their jurisdictions, a review of these laws reveals
significant variations in how they target and enforce compliance. Instead of regulating
all types of plastic throughout their life cycles, these local ordinances primarily focus
on restricting the use and sale of plastic bags and other disposable plastics.

With the Philippines. being a country that relies on marine resources for food
and survival such as fishes, clams, crustaceans, and the like, the possibility of
microplastic contamination to these resources are highly likely. According to the
Philippine Statistics Authority (2019), the following are the most commonly
purchased fishes based on Leyte’s Fishery Production: flying fish (bangsi), indian
mackerel (buraw), goatfish (timbungan), Sardinella spp. (tamban) snapper
(maya-maya), slipmouth (sapsap), big-eyed scad (matambaka), roundscad

(galunggong), tilapia, and milkfish (bangus). Consequently, this may pose various


risks to the health of the consumers due to exposure of microplastics through indirect
ingestion from marine resources.

First-hand experience on marine litter problem seemed to alter the behavior of
people which coincidentally imbibed and valued the fact that marine debris affects
communities all around the world and is not just a problem for coastal areas (Hartley
et al., 2018). Seeing trash along the coast was linked to more worry and behavioral
intentions which may contribute to capitalizing on people's strong affinities for coastal
habitats to inspire action on land to address the causes of marine litter. Additionally,
there is a lack of study on the psychological and sociodemographic variables that
influence people's worry about marine litter and readiness to take action to address the

issue (Hartley et al., 2018).

2.6 Microplastics in Food and the Implications to Human Health

The impact of microplastics on human health depends on the concentrations of
exposure. Owing to limited data in the field of microplastic research, there is a lack of
sufficient information to accurately gauge the actual levels of microplastics that
individuals might encounter through their food consumption (Smith er a/., 2018). An
approximated total of 37 particles per individual annually enters the human body via
salt intake (Mato ef al., 2001: Lusher er a/., 2017; Lithner, 2017; Van Cauwenberghe
& Janssen, 2014)

Microplastics potentially pose a threat to human well-being through physical
and chemical routes (Smith ef a/., 2018). Microplastics can interact with the airway or
gastrointestinal epithelium through various pathways, such as endocytic processes and
persorption (Wright & Kelly, 2017). The medical literature on the consequences of

micro- and nanoplastics from surgeries and inhalation offers insights into the dynamic


movement of plastics in the human body (Lusher ef al., 2017). For instance, micro-
and nanoplastics released during surgeries mimic the effects of absorbed particles in
the bloodstream and tissues and inhaled particles also interact with the same epithelial
tissue involved in ingestion. Microbes on ingested microplastics may serve as carriers
for harmful bacteria, potentially causing direct physiological impacts (Wright &
Kelly, 2017).

Chemical additives within plastic may induce toxicity, and the potential for
microplastics to accumulate persistent organic pollutants (POPs) raises concerns
about the transfer of these hazardous substances to marine animals and, consequently,
humans (Smith ef al., 2018; Lusher et a/., 2017). One of the major POPs are
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). The European Food Safety Authority monitors six
indicators for non-dioxin-like PCBs in food to assess overall dietary exposure, with
fish, meat, and dairy recognized as significant sources (Smith ef a/., 2018; ATSDR,
2017). Although the role of microplastics in this exposure is uncertain, these findings
highlight a persistent route of exposure to animal tissues and trophic level transfer
(Smith ef al., 2018). Total PCB intake ranges from 1 to 83 ng PCB/kg body weight
per day, and the average PAH intake, using benzo[a]pyrene as a reference, varies from

4 to 10 ng/kg body weight per day (FAO/WHO, 2016; ATSDR, 2017).


CHAPTER 3
MATERIALS AND METHODS

3.1 Study site

The study was conducted in the city of Tacloban (Figure 2). Tacloban is a
coastal city with a dense population located in the Eastern Visayas region. Despite
serving as the provincial capital, the city operates autonomously from the province of
Leyte. The city has a land area of 77.88 square miles or 201.72 square kilometers.
251,881 people were living there as of the 2020 Census (PSA, 2021) which accounted
for 5.54% of the region's total population in Eastern Visayas. According to these
numbers, the population density is calculated to be 1,249 people per km’, or 3,234

people per mi? (PSA, 2021).

Figure 2. Map of the location of the three wet markets in Tacloban City as sampling
source for commercial fish


3.2 Sample collection

The study employed a purposive type survey among the fish vendors as to
what fishes were the highly sold in their stalls. Additionally, the vendors were also
asked where they obtained the fish that were being sold. After obtaining such data, the
researcher used a ranking system to determine the top five most purchased species of
fish. Twenty-five samples per each species were collected and analyzed.

During the sample collection, the size of the fishes was determined by
measuring from the furthest forward point of the head with the mouth closed to the
furthest tip of the tail with the tail compressed or squeezed (Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission, 2022). Additionally, the habitat of each fish was
accounted for by determining which of the different oceanic zones (i.e. pelagic,
benthopelagic, pelagic neritic, demersal, bathypelagic) it came from (Abifion e/ al.,
2020). Furthermore, the weight of the fish was determined with its guts intact.

Similarly, the guts of the fish were weighed separately.

3.3 Characterization of microplastics

To prevent potential contamination, all fish samples were tightly wrapped in
aluminum foil and ziploc bags before being placed in an ice chest box. The sampling
location and fishing information were then noted. To prevent microplastic
contamination, all beakers and equipment used in the analysis were likewise
thoroughly cleaned with distilled water. To isolate the gastrointestinal system of the
animal, a lengthwise cut in the fishes' bellies from head to anus was performed. To
avoid contamination, the GI tract was removed from the animal and weighed in a
sizable jar covered in aluminum foil (Abiiion ef al., 2020). Before initiating the

aforementioned procedure, the jars were weighed, and the weighing scale was reset to


zero. Following that, the entrails were deposited into the jar, thus determining their
weight.

For the analysis of microplastics, a strong base such as NaOH was used. As
part of the digestion procedure, the guts of the fish were subjected to three times the
volume of 1M NaOH solution. Subsequently, the samples were incubated in an oven
at 60 degrees Celsius for 24 hours. After the incubation period, the contents
underwent vacuum filtration using Whatman filters with a pore size of 10
micrometers (um). To address possible contamination, the analysis included a
procedural blank, following Vandermeesch ef al. (2015) study. The filters were then
air dried for a minimum of 12 hours. After it was dried, the filter sheets were
examined under an Olympus CX23 compound microscope to identify microplastic
particles, noting their quantity, type, color, and shape. For confirmation of relatively
small microplastics, magnifications of 40x or 100x were employed. Microplastics
were visually documented and qualitatively evaluated. To provide qualitative
descriptions, a table adapted from Hidalgo-Ruz ef al. (2012) study was utilized. The
size of microplastics was determined using ImageJ software, based on Cabansag ef al.
(2021) method. The suspected microplastics were then sent to the Department of Pure
and Applied Chemistry (DOPAC), Visayas State University (VSU), where an FTIR
spectrometer was used to identify the composition of any potential plastic polymers

present.

3.4 Survey interview
Before the actual survey, a pre-test survey was conducted. Prior to the survey's
execution, all participants—in the pre-test as well as the real survey— signed a

volunteer consent form.


A purposive sampling was employed for the selection of respondents for the
KAP survey, specifically, targeting the fish consumers in Tacloban City. The primary
research tool employed was a face-to-face interview, accompanied by a printed survey
questionnaire. The questions used in the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Survey
were adapted from the study carried out by Yu ef al. (2022). The questionnaire was
structured into four sections, covering various aspects. Firstly, it captured the
sociodemographic profile of the respondents. Secondly, it assessed the respondents’
knowledge regarding access to information about microplastics and plastics, including
the sources of information they rely on. The third section delved into policies related
to plastic waste management. Lastly, the attitude section focused on the respondents’
sense of responsibility, motivation, and capability to reduce microplastic and plastic

pollution, while the perception section examined their behavioral intentions.

3.5 Data Analysis

A statistical analysis was carried out for the characterization of the
microplastics using the PAST Statistical Software. Pearson r correlation was used to
determine the correlation between dimensions of the fish and the presence of
microplastics. Similarly, Analysis of Similarity was employed to determine the
dissimilarity or similarity of microplastics found in the gut samples from each fish
species. In addition, the Test for Equal Means is utilized to determine the difference
between the sizes of microplastics found. The Spearman's rho correlation coefficient
was employed to establish the significance and measure the correlation between the

variables of knowledge, attitude, and perception.


CHAPTER 4
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Fish Sample Identification

Chanos chanos or locally known as “‘bangus” is the highly purchased fish
(Figure 3). It is followed by Sardinella spp. known as “tamban”., Decapterus spp.
“burot”, Rastrelliger brachysoma “buraw”, and Rastrelliger faughni “hasa-hasa”,

respectively.

4.2 Source of Fish Supplies in the Market

Based on the interviews conducted with the 54 fish vendors, it was revealed
that the Tacloban City Fish Port serves as the primary source of fish supplies for fish
vendors, amounting to 68% of their stock for resale. Babatngon constitutes only 7%,
whereas Catbalogan, Samar, Sagkahan, Tacloban City, and Marabut, Samar each
contribute 5%. Guiuan has the lowest percentage at 3%, followed closely by Tanauan

at 2% (Figure 4).

Figure 5.

Upon conducting further research, it was discovered that the fish supplies at
the Tacloban City Fish Port originate from various locations shown in Figure 5.
According to Ben Pido, a monitoring officer at the port, the fish supplies are sourced
from the following areas: (a) General Santos City in the SOCCKSARGEN Region,
(b) Guiuan in Eastern Samar, (c) San Juanico Strait in the Eastern Visayas Region, (d)
Catbalogan City in Samar, (e) Babatngon in Leyte, (f) Basilan in the Bangsamoro
Autonomous Region, (g) Davao City in Mindanao, (h) Palapag in Northern Samar,
and (i) Rambulan in Sorsogon City. Notably, the highly sought-after bangus fish is
sourced from the aquaculture ponds/ system from Babatngon, tamban and burot from
Catbalogan City and Rambulan, Sorsogon, while buraw and hasa-hasa are obtained
from General Santos City. These findings also indicate that the water bodies in these
locations are contaminated with microplastics, raising concerns about potential
contamination in other resources as well. This also underscores the need for
comprehensive measures to address and mitigate the pervasive presence of
microplastics in these environments, safeguarding not only the fish supplies but also

the entire ecosystem.

4.3 Fish Characterization

Shown in Table 2 is the mean dimensions of the fishes needed in the study
namely, the mean length of fish, mean weight of fish, mean weight of guts, and mean
weight of fish without guts intact. The habitat or environment of the fish species is
also accounted for.

Among the fishes studied, Chanos chanos is the largest having the longest

mean length of 32.4+3.2cm and heaviest at 302.0+98.6g. On the other hand,


Sardinella spp. is the smallest among the fish species, with an average length of
13.8+0.6g and weight of 18.7+1.4g.

Fish populations consist of individuals with diverse genetic traits, including
variations in growth rates, body structures, and maximum sizes. Genetic differences
contribute to the natural variation in fish sizes within a species (Skibinski, 1994;

Ward, 2000).

4.4 Microplastic Analysis

4.4.1 Number of Microplastics

The amount of microplastics in the fish samples is shown in Figure 6 and 7 by
fish species. It shows that Rastrelliger faughni exhibits the highest concentration of
microplastics found in the guts. It is followed by the Chanos chanos, Sardinella spp.,
Decapterus spp., Rastrelliger brachysoma, respectively.

Raustrelliger faughni has the highest average number of 10.6742.9
microplastics found in the guts, followed by Chanos chanos with 9.67+1.86,

Sardinella spp. 5+1, Decapterus spp. 3+0.57, and Rastrelliger brachysoma 2.33+40.46.

Figure 7. Average number of microplastics found in the five most purchased fish in

This study showed that S. canaliculatus and K. rupestris (Cabansag et al.,
2021), exhibited higher levels of microplastic contamination compared to the five fish
samples analyzed. S. canaliculatus displayed the presence of 85 microplastics, while
Valamugil speigleri had 33 microplastics. Chanos chanos, Sardinella spp., Decapterus

spp., Rastrelliger brachysoma, and Rastrelliger faughni showed lower levels with


2941.86, 1541, 940.57, 740.46, and 3242.9 microplastics detected, respectively.
These findings emphasize the elevated microplastic contamination levels observed in
the fish species from Cancabato Bay and Lawaan River, signifying the urgency to
address and mitigate microplastic pollution in these areas.

Table 3 displays the rankings of the studied fish species based on the number
of detected microplastics per fish. Among these species, Chanos chanos, commonly
known as bangus from Cebu, takes the top position with the highest number of
microplastics found in the guts per fish.Following closely in second place is 4uxis
rochei, commonly referred to as bullet tuna, with an average of 6.6 microplastics per
fish. Sardinella fimbriata, also known as fringe scaled sardine, holds the third
position, followed by Atule mate, recognized as yellowtail scad.

Table 3 also implies that fishes sold in the Tacloban City market in
comparatively less polluted bodies of water. Chanos chanos sourced from Babatngon,
Leyte, exhibits a lower microplastic content in the guts, measuring 9.67 microplastics
per fish, in contrast to the ones from Cebu, where the count stands at 11 microplastics
per fish. Similarly, Sardinella sp in the Northwest Peninsula of Malaysia records a
higher microplastic count per fish, amounting to 6.5, compared to Sardinella spp.
sourced from either Catbalogan City or Rambulan, Sorsogon. Raustrelliger
brachysoma sourced from General Santos City have lesser microplastics per fish with
only 2.33 compared to the same species found in the Northwest Peninsula of Malaysia

which is found to have 6.2 microplastic per fish. However, the Decapterus spp. from


Catbalogan City or Rambulan, Sorsogon have slightly higher microplastics count per
fish which is 3 per fish compared to the ones found in the South of Maldives is 2.19

The eating habits of fish have a substantial impact on their consumption of
microplastics. With the rise in plastic manufacturing over the years, this dietary
behavior has emerged as a prominent contributor to the pollution of fish by
microplastics. The cleanliness of the surrounding environment is also a pivotal factor
influencing the presence of microplastics in fish. Given that a substantial portion of
the world's plastic waste finds its way into adjacent water bodies, a considerable
portion of macroplastics break down into microplastics.

Among the 25 samples per fish species collected from the three stations
1246.5 samples of Rastrelliger faughni was found to contain microplastics in their
guts, 942 samples of Chanos chanos, 8+1.53 samples Sardinella spp., 8+1.53 samples
of Decapterus spp., and 741.53 samples of Rastrelliger brachysoma contain
microplastics in the guts (Figure 8). Based on the aforementioned statement,
Rastrelliger faughni has the highest number of individual samples containing
microplastics in the guts. Followed by, Chanos chanos, Sardinella spp., Decapterus
spp., and Rastrelliger brachysoma, respectively. Additionally, Abiiion et al. (2020)
found that the commercially available bangus in Cebu had a considerably higher
presence of microplastics, with an average count of approximately 11.3 pieces per
individual fish. In Northern Mindanao, a study by Palermo and Labrador (2020)
revealed that Sardinella sp. contained around 3.74 microplastic pieces per individual
fish, which is comparatively higher than the count of 0.56 pieces per individual fish
found in Sardinella sp. obtained from Catbalogan and Sorsogon in the Tacloban
market. The Decapterus spp., observed in the South Maldives (Shiyana ef al., 2022),

exhibited an average of 2.19 pieces of microplastic per individual fish, whereas


Decapterus sp. sourced from Catbalogan only contained 0.36 pieces per individual
fish, indicating a significantly lower quantity. Furthermore, commercially sold
Rastrelliger sp. in the markets of Cebu City were found to have 5.3 pieces per
individual fish (Abiiion ef a/., 2020), which is higher compared to the commercially

sold ones in the Tacloban City market, where the count was 1.28 pieces per fish.

Figure 8. Number of the five most purchased fish in the three major wet markets of
Tacloban City, Philippines detected with microplastics in their guts

Among the three markets studied, Tacloban City Market stands out for having
the highest concentration of microplastics in the guts of its sold fishes as shown in
Figure 9. Fishes sold at the Tacloban City Market were directly sourced from the
Tacloban Fish Port. This suggests that the origins of the studied fishes, including
locations such as Sagkahan, Tacloban City, General Santos City, Guiuan in Eastern
Samar, San Juanico Strait in the Eastern Visayas Region, Catbalogan City in Samar,
Babatngon in Leyte, Basilan in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, Davao City in
Mindanao, Palapag in Northern Samar, and Rambulan in Sorsogon City, are likely to

be already contaminated with microplastics.


Figure 9. Total amount of microplastics collected in the guts of the five most
purchased fish in the three major wet markets of Tacloban City, Philippines

Fish samples obtained from San Fernando Market exhibit the lowest levels of
detected microplastics, closely followed by those from Caibaan Market. These results
provide additional evidence that the areas where the fish are sourced experience
comparatively lower levels of microplastic contamination which may include Marabut

in Eastern Samar.

Shown in Table 4 is the Pearson Correlation among the fish dimensions and
types of microplastics found using the PAST Statistical Software. The table suggests
that the weight of the fish and the weight of its guts also influenced its length.

The size of a fish, measured by its length and weight, typically increases in
proportion to its gut size, as indicated by a high and positive correlation coefficient of
0.9. This suggests a strong relationship between the size of the fish and the size of its
gut. However, when examining the number of microplastics found in the fish's guts,

there is no significant correlation with the length and weight of the fish, with


correlation coefficients ranging from 0.1 to negative values. This implies that the
presence of microplastics in the guts of the fish is more likely due to random chance
rather than being influenced by specific size-related factors.

Among the fish species studied, Decapterus spp. has the largest average
microplastic size (Table 5), signifying a notably higher presence of larger-sized
microplastics compared to the other species. Chanos chanos ranks second in
microplastic size, followed by Sardinella spp., Rastrelliger faughni, and Rastrelliger
brychysoma, respectively.

Genetic differences play a significant role in the natural variation observed in
fish sizes within a species (Ward & Robert, 2000). Some individuals may carry genes
that predispose them to grow faster or reach larger sizes compared to others. These
genetic variations can lead to differences in growth rates, where some fish individuals
may exhibit rapid growth and achieve larger sizes earlier in their lives, while others

may have slower growth rates and reach smaller sizes.

4.5 Microplastic Characterization

43.1 Type

There is a significant dominance of fibers, comprising 84% among the
identified microplastics as illustrated in Figure 10. Pellets contribute to 7% of the
total, while films and fragments constitute 5% and 4%, respectively, of the overall

microplastic composition.

Fiber «Film © Pellet © Fragment

Figure 10. Types of Microplastics found in the guts of the five most purchased fish in
the three major wet markets of Tacloban City, Philippines using the Characterization
of Microplastics (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012)

The fiber type microplastics are mainly released during use and wear of

synthetic textile products during laundry, becoming the main source of secondary


microplastics in the environment (Chen ef al., 2022). Microfibers are also released
when fishnets are torn due to old age and exposure to different environmental factors
(Montarsolo ef al., 2018).

The Analysis of Similarities test (ANOSIM) through the PAST Statistical
Software, suggests a lack of statistical significant dissimilarity in the microplastics
found (p=0.7618; r=-0.02762). It indicates that the dissimilarity is minimal and not
practically significant. This further suggests that the majority of the microplastic
found among the fish samples is the same, which is fiber constituting 84%

microplastics that are found.

4.3.2 Shape
A portion comprising 73% of the microplastics discovered in the gut samples

of the fish exhibit elongated shapes (Figure 11).

*Elongated ®Iiregular * Rounded

Figure 11. Shape of microplastics found in the guts of the five most purchased fish in
the three major wet markets of Tacloban City, Philippines

This particular shape is linked to the fibers that were identified that may have

come from fish nets and textiles. Rebelein ef al. (2021) also observed that due to their


elongated structure, fibers could potentially resemble microscopic plankton and other
marine substances. Irregular shapes were also identified, which are typical of
fragments and film. In the study conducted by Piyarwadhana et al. (2021) studying
commercially sold marine dried fishes in Asian countries, revealed that fibers
constituted the highest percentage, accounting for 79.8% of all microplastics.
Fragments and films, on the other hand, comprised 11.4% and 8.8% respectively.
Meanwhile, in the study of Foo ef al. (2022) on commercial marine fishes of
Northwest Peninsular Malaysia, the most commonly encountered microplastic type
was fragments, constituting 49.5% of the total. Fibers followed at 41.9%, while
pellets accounted for 7.6%. The least frequently observed microplastic type was film,

representing only 0.9% of the total.

4.3.3 Color

A variety of microplastic colors were observed in the collected fish samples.
However, orange emerged as the dominant color, accounting for 46% of all colors
observed. The second most prevalent color was blue, making up 16% of the observed
colors. Dark blue and white shared an equal percentage of 6%, while faded blue, light
brown, and black each accounted for 5% (Figure 12).

In the study of Cabansag ef al. (2021), blue is the most dominant color found
in the guts of the fishes that were studied. Similarly, Abifion et al. (2020), also found
that blue microplastics were the most common color group among all the fish,
comprising 48% of the samples. Red followed closely behind at 39%, while black and
white accounted for 8% and 5% respectively. Meanwhile, another study by
Piyarwadhana ef al. (2021), found that transparent and white particles comprised the

dominant type of plastic particles, accounting for 70.2%. The remaining plastic


particles had color variations, with red, blue, and black+brown representing 5.5%,

15.8%, and 8.6%, respectively.

When plastics are exposed to the natural environment, they go through various
aging processes such as sunlight exposure, the impact of waves and wind, physical
wear, heat-induced oxidation, and biodegradation (Zhao et al., 2022). Among these
processes, sunlight exposure is considered the main factor that causes plastic aging. It
triggers reactions in the polymer chains, leading to their breakage and the formation
of microplastics. This photoaging also brings about changes in the colors of plastic
polymers. Conversely, the color of plastics themselves has a significant impact on
how they absorb sunlight, with different colors absorbing light of varying
wavelengths and energy levels.

In the study of Chen ef al. (2020), microplastics exhibit a diverse range of

colors in both environmental matrices and aquatic organisms, which can be attributed


to variations in their manufacturing purposes. For instance, the addition of pigments
to polymers is a common practice in the industry. Marine application plastics, for
example, may contain alkyd resins of different colors, while toys with yellow to
orange hues might incorporate lead chromate pigments. Furthermore, the process of
environmental weathering can result in color degradation, causing the original color to

fade or take on a yellowish tint (Chen ef al., 2019).

4.6 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Analysis

Figure 13 depicts the Fourier-Transform Infrared spectra of the suspected
microplastics, as well as the negative control, and the FTIR Spectra reference.

The polymer types identified are Cellulose Propionate, HDPE (High Density
Polyethylene), Sealing Ring EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer), and
Polycetal. The spectrum matching process was conducted using the open-source
spectral classification software, Open Specy (Cowger ef al., 2020). Differences were
observed between the actual and reference spectra, which can be influenced by the
polarity of the solvent used (Parlak and Ramasami, 2020).

As noted in the study of Yu ef al. (2022), the interaction between the solvent
and the sample can affect infrared absorption bands, particularly those involving
hydrogen bonding between the solvent's O-H group and the sample-solvent bond in

the same environment.

Exposure of plastics to ultraviolet irradiation can result in chemical alterations
that ultimately lead to the fragmentation of the materials (Parlak and Ramasami,
2020). Additionally, using the Open Specy spectral classification software, the
Pearson correlation was revealed to be relatively low. However, according to the study

of Cowger ef al. (2020), this might be attributed to poor quality spectra and/or of a

material type not currently available in the reference library. It is advisable to conduct


additional research, exploring alternative digestants that may enhance spectral
readings.

Various studies have employed other digestants aside from using a strong base
like NaOH. A strong nitric acid solution was used in the study of microplastics in
Chanos chanos (Priscilla and Patria, 2020), potassium hydroxide (KOH) in
Decapterus spp. (Shiyana et al., 2022), nitric acid (HNO )and perchloric acid (HCIO,)
in a 1 to 5 ratio in the Sardinella spp. (Efadeswarni, 2019), and nitric acid in a 4:1
ratio was employed for Rastrilliger spp. (Syafitri, 2021). Furthermore, the Open
Specy spectral classification software has the potential for more precise results in

microplastic research (Cowger et al., 2020).

4.7 Fish Feeding Patterns Contributing to Microplastic Ingestion

The majority of the fish species included in the study inhabit the pelagic zone,
except for Chanos chanos, which is known to regularly venture into estuaries and
freshwater environments (Animal Diversity Web, 2006). There is an observed
difference in the feeding habits among the fish species. Chanos chanos has
omnivorous feeding habits whose diet consist mainly of phytoplankton, zooplankton,
and including detritus (Hiatt, 2011). Caged Chanos chanos, however, can acquire
microplastics through the irrigation system and cleanliness of the surrounding waters
(Sanabila ef al., 2022).

Microplastics may enter from already contaminated waters and stay in the
aquaculture ponds. Additionally, cleanliness of aquaculture ponds will also determine
the occurrence of microplastics. Plastic debris coming from ropes, discarded fish nets,
and among others will later on degrade into microplastics. Sardinella spp. are

primarily herbivorous eaters whose diet consists mainly of phytoplanktons but also


consume zooplankton as part of their diet (Shah ef a/., 2019). Decaplerus spp. are
opportunistic feeders (Rajesh, 2017). Their diet consists mainly of planktonic
organisms such as copepods, krill, and other small crustaceans. They also eat small
fishes, fish larvae, and other various types of zooplankton. Rastrilliger spp. are active
hunters whose diet primarily consists of small fishes and crustaceans (Hajisamae,
2022). They also feed on zooplanktons such as copepods and shrimp larvae.

The feeding behavior of fish plays a significant role in their ingestion of
microplastics. As plastic production has increased over time, this behavior has
become a major factor in the contamination of fish with microplastics. It is estimated
that around 20% of this plastic waste finds its way into marine habitats (Schachter &
Karasik, 2022). Alarmingly, in proximity to vulnerable rivers, over 74% of the plastic
waste that eventually reaches the ocean was initially collected but managed to escape
from open dumps.

The mistaken identity of microplastics as food by fish is a consequence of
their size, shape, and color, which can mimic natural prey items such as zooplankton
or small fish (Botterell, 2019). For many species of fish that rely on visual cues to
locate their food, microplastics can be easily mistaken as a viable food source. This
can have detrimental effects on the health and well-being of these marine organisms.
When fish ingest microplastics, several negative consequences can occur. The
ingestion of microplastics can lead to physical blockages or obstructions in the
digestive system of the fish, potentially impairing their ability to consume and digest
real food (Priya, 2023). This can result in reduced nutrient absorption, malnutrition,

and overall poor health.


4.8 Knowledge, Attitude, Perception Survey

KAP surveys help identify gaps in knowledge and misconceptions, allowing
for targeted educational campaigns and awareness programs to address them. It can
help integrate more appropriate interventions and foster positive changes towards
mitigating the impacts of microplastics on the environment and human health (Yu ef
al., 2022).

4.8.1 Socio-demographic profile of respondents

A total of only 150 respondents were willing to be interviewed for the
knowledge, attitude, and perception survey. The majority of the individuals
interviewed fell within the age range of 21-25 years old, accounting for half of the
total participants. The majority of the willing participants were primarily college
students, a factor that significantly contributed to the overall participant demographic
(Figure 14A). Among them, females constituted 55.7% of the respondents, while
males made up the remaining 44.3% (Figure 14B).

figure 15A. Approximately half of the respondents reported no income, which can be
attributed to their status as either students or unemployed individuals. Furthermore,
19.5% of the respondents earned between Php1,000 and Php5,000 per month, while

14.8% earned between Php6,000 and Php10,000 (Figure 15B).

towards microplastics

4.8.2 Knowledge

The findings from the knowledge test assessing respondents’ understanding of
microplastics are presented in Table 6. The test consisted of five questions focusing
on various aspects, including the definition, classification, sources, and effects of
microplastics. The results indicate that a majority of the respondents, specifically

68.7%, demonstrated knowledge regarding microplastics as tiny plastic particles.


Moreover, 90.7% of the participants were aware that microplastics originate from the
breakdown of larger plastic materials. Additionally, 90% of the respondents were
knowledgeable about common everyday items such as food packaging, cosmetics,
textiles, and similar products being significant sources of microplastics. Furthermore,
62.7% recognized that fishing nets used in the fishing industry can contribute to
microplastic pollution. However, despite understanding the issues surrounding
microplastic pollution and its impact on fish supply, a notable portion of the
respondents (21.3%) indicated their willingness to consume fish containing
microplastics.

5. Microplastics are absent in the bodies of fishes. 21.3% 48%

The results revealed that people's comprehension of microplastics appeared to
be shaped by their personal life encounters, resulting in limited familiarity with
certain technical aspects of microplastics. This finding is consistent with the research
carried out by Deng er al. (2020) and Yu et al. (2022), which also emphasized that the
general public's knowledge about plastics typically relies on common sense and

personal experiences, rather than a comprehensive grasp of the physical and chemical


properties of plastics. However, most people have an awareness of the environmental
consequences of plastic, yet the precise magnitude of these effects remains uncertain

(Schultz, 2002; Deng ev al., 2020).

4.8.3 Attitude

The statements aimed at assessing the respondents’ attitude focus on their
willingness to take action regarding microplastics is presented in Table 7. A
significant majority, around 71.3%, consider microplastics pollution as an urgent issue
that requires immediate attention. Moreover, only 38% believe that they have a
responsibility to reduce microplastic pollution, while 31% believe they are not
accountable for mitigating it, and 30% remain uncertain. It is worth noting that the
number of respondents who feel responsible is almost equal to those who do not.
Additionally, more than 90% express their willingness to comply with strict
regulations on proper waste disposal to minimize microplastic pollution. They also
show a positive attitude towards initiatives that promote the preservation of marine
life, such as coastal cleanups and appropriate waste management. Furthermore, a
majority of respondents, specifically 65.3%, indicate their reluctance to consume fish
contaminated with microplastics, which further confirms their awareness of
microplastics' presence in fish bodies.

According to research conducted by Pickens (2005), attitude refers to a
person's inclination to behave in a particular manner based on their experiences and
personality. Attitude and the environment interact reciprocally: a person's attitude can
be influenced by the social world around them, while their attitude, in turn, has the
potential to impact the social environment. The aforementioned statement indicates
that the respondents perceive microplastic pollution as an environmental concer that
requires the collective attention of society to implement effective countermeasures
and mitigation strategies. They demonstrate environmentally friendly attitudes, as
they believe that their individual actions have a significant impact on both the
problem itself and their overall quality of life. By adopting these environmentally
conscious attitudes, they are actively contributing to solving the issue of microplastic
pollution, recognizing the importance of their personal responsibility in creating a

sustainable environment.


4.8.4 Perception

Table 8 illustrates the participants’ perceptions of microplastics, emphasizing

their awareness of the significance of marine resources, the importance of reducing

single-use plastics, concerns regarding the enforcement of waste management

regulations, and the shared responsibility between the government and individuals in

addressing this environmental issue.

A significant majority, around 82%, recognize the crucial importance of
marine resources for the community's survival. This recognition reflects an
understanding of the significance of preserving these resources and underscores the
potential motivation to take action. Additionally, a majority of respondents express
their agreement with the notion of avoiding single-use plastics as a means to reduce
plastic pollution, considering its significant contribution to the problem of
microplastics. Furthermore, the respondents believe that the implementation of the
Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 is inadequate, leading to the
widespread prevalence of microplastic pollution. They attribute the rampant issue of
microplastic pollution to the shortcomings in enforcing the legislation effectively.
This perception highlights the need for stronger measures and improved waste

management practices to combat the problem more effectively. About 72% of


respondents place the responsibility for effectively managing microplastic pollution
on the government, while 95.4% believe that it is a collective duty shared by the
people to control and address this environmental issue. This indicates an expectation
for government agencies to play a proactive role in addressing the issue and
implementing effective policies and regulations. This finding also emphasizes the
importance of individual action and a collective effort in tackling this environmental
challenge.

According to Pickens' (2005), being conscious of and embracing a particular
situation plays a crucial role in the perception process. This provides additional
insight into why a larger proportion of individuals perceive marine resources as a vital
aspect of society. However, it is crucial for the government to further enhance the
implementation of RA 9003 since they possess the authority to create, enact, enforce,
and allocate resources for these policies (da Costa et al., 2020; Yu ef al., 2022).
Selective perception is a common occurrence, influenced by an individual's beliefs,
experiences, and attitudes, leading to the subjective interpretation of information
(Pickens, 2005). Consequently, as integral members of society, it becomes the

responsibility of individuals to actively contribute to resolving this issue.

moderate level of association between the compared variables while coefficients


ranging 0.8 to 1 suggests a strong positive relationship (Jeremias and Fellizar, 2019;

Yu ef al., 2022).

The data reveals a strong and direct link between respondents’ understanding
of microplastics originating from the breakdown of larger plastic items, resulting in
the production of microplastics smaller than 5mm, and their comprehensive
knowledge of the sources of microplastics. Furthermore, there is a significant positive
correlation between people's awareness of the presence of microplastics in fish and
their decision to still consume fish. This suggests that a substantial portion of their
diet and livelihood relies heavily on fish consumption, making it challenging to give
up this practice.

Moreover, a moderate positive association is observed between individuals’
sense of responsibility to reduce microplastic pollution and their commitment to
effectively address it. However, a strong positive correlation exists between
irresponsible plastic usage and the inadequate enforcement of RA 9003, contributing
to the widespread prevalence of microplastic pollution. Despite the perceived lack of
enforcement of Ecological Solid Waste Management, individuals still perceive
themselves as integral to effectively managing microplastics and minimizing their

impact.

4.8.6. Comparing the Spearman rho correlation among the KAP variables with

th ndents” highest educational attainment

Based on Table 10, the respondents demonstrated knowledge of microplastics
and their origins, regardless of their highest level of education. However, their
understanding of microplastics appears to be based more on personal experiences
rather than technical expertise. This finding aligns with Deng ez al.'s (2020) study,

which revealed that the general public's knowledge of plastics tends to stem from


common sense and personal encounters, rather than an understanding of the
physico-chemical properties of plastics.

While individuals are aware of existing and proposed policies conceming
plastics, they lack basic information about microplastics. Furthermore, irrespective of
educational background, a moderate to high correlation was observed between
individuals’ efforts to protect the environment and their perception of themselves as
active participants in resolving the microplastics issue. Additionally, a moderate to
highly positive correlation was found between people's awareness of microplastics in
fish and their decision to continue consuming fish. This indicates that a significant
portion of their diet and livelihood relies heavily on fish consumption, posing
challenges to altering this behavior.

4.8.7. Comparing the Spearman rho correlation among the KAP variables with

The same with the previous results on Table 10, the respondents in the study
showed knowledge of microplastics and their origins, regardless of their education
level. However, their understanding of microplastics seemed to be based more on
personal experiences rather than technical expertise. While people are aware of
plastic-related policies, they lack basic information about microplastics. Regardless of
educational background, there was a correlation between individuals’ efforts to protect
the environment and their perception of themselves as active participants in
addressing the microplastics issue. Moreover, there was a notable correlation between
people's awareness of microplastics in fish and their decision to continue consuming
fish, indicating that changing this behavior presents challenges due to its significant

impact on their diet and livelihood.

CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

To assess the extent of microplastic pollution, microscopy and FTIR
techniques were employed to determine the presence and type of microplastics in fish
samples from three public markets in Tacloban City. This analysis adds to the data on
potential human exposure. Additionally, a KAP survey provides insights into the
knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of local communities regarding microplastics,
contributing to a better understanding of awareness levels in Tacloban City.

The study findings indicate that microplastics are present in all of the top five
most highly purchased fish species in Tacloban City's market. Among the 25 samples
per fish species collected from the three stations 1246.5 samples of Rastrelliger
faughni, 942 samples of Chanos chanos, 8+1.53 samples Sardinella spp., 8+1.53
samples of Decapterus spp., and 7+1,53 samples of Rastrelliger brachysoma contain
microplastics in the guts. Raustrelliger faughni has the highest average number of
10.6742.9 microplastics found in the guts, followed by Chanos chanos with
9.67+1.86, Sardinella spp. 5+1, Decapterus spp. 3+0.57, and Rastrelliger brachysoma
2.3340.46.

The identified types of microplastics are predominantly fibers, followed by
film, pellets, and fragments which is further supported by Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Additionally, a variety of colors and shapes were
observed, with elongated shapes being prominent and orange as the prevailing color.

The results of the social survey revealed that respondents' knowledge about
microplastics likely originates from their personal life experiences. The respondents
exhibited a positive attitude towards reducing plastic pollution, and a significant

majority also recognized the significance of coastal waters to them.


With a significant number of people who are still willing to consume fishes
with microplastics, it is recommended to raise awareness about the potential health
tisks associated with consuming fishes containing microplastics and promote
sustainable practices to reduce plastic pollution in order to mitigate the ingestion of
microplastics through seafood consumption.

In future research, it would be valuable to explore sustainable alternatives to
single-use plastics through a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, considering the
widespread presence of microplastics in marine environments and organisms.
Additionally, conducting social surveys involving households, local government
officials, and students would provide a broader understanding of perspectives and
attitudes towards microplastics. Furthermore, investigating the comparison of
microplastics in sediments and water would enable estimation of the deposition of
microplastics in the bottom layers of water bodies. To gain scientific insights into the
direct human exposure to microplastics, it is crucial for microplastic research to focus
on the accumulation of microplastics in the muscle tissues of fish. This will provide
valuable information regarding the extent of microplastic contamination in fish and its
potential impact on human consumption.

To promote effective management of microplastic pollution, regulatory
authorities can offer incentives to barangays (local communities) that demonstrate
exemplary practices. In addition, it is crucial to conduct targeted information,
education, and communication campaigns, focusing on technical details regarding
microplastics and the potential health risks associated with their ingestion, to educate
barangays and local government units. The government, particularly the Local
Government Unit, should take a proactive stance in safeguarding consumer interests

and ensuring food safety, acting as leaders in this endeavor.
