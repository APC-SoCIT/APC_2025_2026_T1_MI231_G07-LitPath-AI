ABSTRACT

Planting date is an important management practice that can significantly alter crop
performance. This study sought to evaluate the morpho-physiology, yield, and seed quality
of six soybean genotypes sown under four planting dates. The experiment was conducted
under Bukidnon conditions in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four
replicates. Results of this study revealed significant interaction effects (P<0.05) between
planting dates and genotypes across all parameters tested except for the seed moisture
content. Planting in May 2022 significantly extended the phenological stages (R1 and R6)
which resulted in an increase in the accumulation of GDD. May 2022 planting was
characterized by higher growth temperature, high rainfall intensity, and longer photoperiod
compared to other planting dates. Longer duration of phenological stages resulted to an
increase in plant height, number of nodes plant⁻¹ and plant biomass which had major
implications on yield of vegetable soybeans. Green pod yield ha⁻¹ in AGS 374, Manchuria,
Ryokko, and Tiwala 12 was significantly increased when planted both in September 2021
and May 2022 while Tiwala 8 has only increased its yield when planted in the latter. Green
pod yield of Tudela Black was only on decline when sown in November 2021.
Consequently, May 2022 planting decreased the amount of oil while total protein and total
sugar were highly variable across planting dates. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that
green pod yield was positively correlated to the number of pods plant⁻¹, and plant height at
harvest consistent across genotypes. For optimum vegetable soybean production, planting
starting from May to September can potentially improve yield and seed quality. The results
of this study may aid growers in the Philippines in the selection of appropriate planting
date intended to optimize vegetable soybean production.

CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION

Edamame or otherwise known as vegetable soybean is a large-seeded type of
soybean normally harvested when the seeds reach the R6 developmental stage
(approximately 80% mature) (Rao e/ al., 2002) and having maintained about 65% moisture
content (Kumar ef a/., 2011). They are characterized by having a sweet, buttery, beany and
nutty flavor compared to the grain soybeans. Either fresh or frozen edamame can be cooked
in a similar manner with sweet peas or lima bean with or without the pods which can be
stir-fried or added to stews and soups (Rao ef al., 2002).

Some agronomic practices are thought to influence the quality and flavor of
vegetable soybean (Duppong and Hatterman- Valenti, 2005) and this includes the planting
time. The effects of sowing or planting dates particularly on grain soybean has been well
recognized; however, fewer research has been dedicated on edamame soybeans (Zhang et
al., 2010). The effects of planting date on soybean yield can vary substantially due to the
differences in environmental conditions principally due to amount of rainfall and
distribution (Egli and Cornelius, 2009). Accordingly, planting date influences soybean
growth and development patterns that impose changes on the fresh pod yield and chemical
composition of seed such as carbohydrate, lipid, and protein content (Li e¢ al., 2014; Hu

and Wiatrak, 2012).

In the Philippines, farmers in Cabanatuan City started commercial production of
edamame that could potentially open fresh opportunities for local production and
eventually reach the foreign market (Ocampo, 2020). The promising result of production
has opted Department of Agriculture (DA) to encourage farmers to produce edamame or
green soybean emphasizing its fast-growing demand in the export market (Mapiles, 2020).
Our locally developed grain soybeans can be potentially repurposed to be consumed in the
same manner as edamame as these genotypes are known to withstand the existing climatic
conditions in the Philippines. There has been no scientific research or publications
regarding the development of locally bred grain soybeans for edamame consumption in the
Philippines. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of planting dates and
genotypes on the morpho-physiology, yield, and quality of soybeans intended for vegetable

consumption.

Significance of the Study

According to the recent reports by the Department of Agriculture (Ocampo, 2020),
a bright future awaits for farmers and traders who will venture on edamame production as
this can generate valuable lucrative income from export market. With this, the researcher
wants to exploit the potentials of our 5 locally developed grain soybean genotypes as to
their yield, morpho-physiological characteristics, seed and pod characteristics and
chemical composition of the seeds such carbohydrate, protein, and lipid content closest to

vegetable soybean traits. It also aims to assess their performance (if the above parameters

will be affected) in different planting dates under Bukidnon condition. Furthermore, the
study will aid in the selection of grain soybean genotypes for use in breeding of superior

quality edamame highly adapted to the Philippine climatic conditions.

Objectives of the Study

General Objectives:
The general purpose of this study was to evaluate the responses of different soybean
genotypes to different planting dates for producing vegetable soybeans.
Specifically, the study aimed to:
1. Determine the phenology, morpho-physiology, yield, and seed quality of
vegetable soybeans as influenced by planting dates and genotypes.
2. Relate the effects of meteorological conditions under each planting date to the
phenology, morpho-physiology, yield, and seed quality of different soybeans.
3. Identify the most suitable planting date for optimum vegetable soybean
production.
4. Establish the type and level of correlation between different groups of

parameters measured.

REVIEW OF LITERATURE CITED

Vegetable Soybean Defined

Vegetable soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) is called edamame in Japan, mao dou
in China, poot kong in Korea and tua rae in Thailand (Lumpkin and Konovsky, 1991).
Vegetable soybeans can be defined as to when they are harvested specifically at the
reproductive stage 6 or R6 right before reaching the R7 stage (Shanmugasundaram ef al.,
1991). They are usually characterized by having large seeds which weighs more than 30 g
per 100 dry seeds. In addition to size, the Japanese has a set of market specification for
vegetable soybeans which include: around <175 pods must be contained in a 500 g frozen
pod packet; the color of the pod must be dark green; the pubescence must be grey; there
must be 2 or more seeds per pod without blemishes; the length of the pod as well as the
width must be >5.0 cm and >1.4 cm, respectively; the hilum must be grey or light-colored;
and more importantly, soybean must possess better flavor, aroma, texture and a slightly
sweet taste (=10% sucrose). Seeds from matured pods can vary in color from yellow or
green to brown or black. Vegetable soybeans can be marketed in many ways such as: the
fresh pods which are still attached to the stem or fresh pods detached from the stem, fresh
shelled green beans, frozen pods and frozen green beans (Shanmugasundaram and Yan,

2010).

Difference of Vegetable Soybean from Grain Soybeans

The most common distinguishing feature of vegetable soybean from grain soybeans
is the seed size. Vegetable soybeans are large-seeded type of soybean which can weigh
around >30 g per 100 dry seeds. However. grain soybeans can be harvested at their green
pod stage and marketed like vegetable soybeans as observed in countries like Nepal. China.
Taiwan and Thailand (Shanmugasundaram and Yan, 2010). Similarly, in the Philippines,
local small-scale growers in some areas of Batangas and Laguna has been growing and
harvesting small-seeded grain soybeans for their green pods. Locally known as ufaw, the
green pods which appears to be almost physiologically matured are threshed and boiled
which are sold in wet market and ambulant vendors, respectively. Sadly, traditional
soyfood chain has been diminishing in which a lot of consumers even in these provinces

are now not familiar with ufaw (E. Enicola, personal communication, October 2020).

Recently, consumer’s attitude towards vegetable consumption has been modified
in most countries through time attributed by introduction of new, high-quality vegetable
soybeans. Vegetable soybean tastes slightly sweeter in contrast to the grain type that is oily

and slightly bitter (Shanmugasundaram and Yan, 2010).

Unlike the grain soybeans which has no preferred pubescence appearance, for
vegetable soybeans, grey pubescence is sought after due to the good pod appearance when
cooked. Japan, where edamame is popular, farmers as well as local growers can spot the
difference in large-seeded vegetable soybean with its good taste and flavor which separates

them from the grain soybeans. Private seed companies tend to exploit this trait in

developing productive and palatable vegetable soybean genotypes. As to their identity, the

color of the dry seed coat ranges from yellow to green, brown, and black (Kitamura, 2001).

Nutritional Components

In as early as 2™ century B.C. in the Far East, vegetable soybean was already
recognized for its nutritional and medicinal values which was also consumed as a vegetable
(Shanmugasundaram, 2001; Shurtleff and Aoyagi, 2009). Vegetable soybeans in the USA
during 1950s were considered better than grain soybeans for human consumption (Weber,
1956). Edamame is good source of plant-based protein which possesses complete proteins
with 18 amino acids including all the essential amino acids, substantial amount of
isoflavones as well as sucrose which are all good for the human diet (Velasquez and
Bhathena, 2007; Li e¢ al., 2012). In addition to proteins, vegetable soybeans are abundant
sources of fat (cholesterol-free), iron, phosphorus, calcium, riboflavin, thiamine, vitamins
A, BI, Eand C, dietary fiber and folic acid in comparison with the sweet green peas (Pisum
sativum L.) Vegetable soybean has a lesser amount of flatulence producing starches than
that of the grain soybean. Similar with the grain soybean, vegetable soybean also possesses
anti-nutritional factors. Trypsin inhibitor (TI) activity is lesser in vegetable soybean
compared to grain soybean. One third of the TI activity remains in vegetable soybean after
boiling for 5 min. Although, despite of its high nutritional value, such would not guarantee

the marketability of vegetable soybeans. Accordingly, pod and green bean appearance,

taste, flavor, texture and nutritional value, following that order, are the five most significant
indicators of quality and acceptability of vegetable soybean (Masuda, 1991).

Soy isoflavones- genistein, daidzein, and in some point glycitein, and their b-
glycosides, have been known to contain an anti-carcinogenic effect against breast cancer
in premenopausal women (Messina, 2004) and androgen-sensitive and -insensitive prostate
cancer in men (Kucuk, 2004; Zhou, 2004). In addition, Masuda (1991) found that vegetable
soybean contains a (32 pg per g lipid); B (trace); y (1038 yg per g lipid) and 5 (148 pg per
g lipid) tocopherol at 25 and 40 days after flowering (DAF). During the mature stage or at
75 DAF, the four tocopherol contents rose to 109, 62, 1109, and 402 yg per g lipid,
respectively. At the green stage, the entire tocopherol content is around 12 1g per seed (40
DAF) whereas at 75 DAF, the total tocopherol content was increased by 83 1g per seed.
So to speak, tocopherol, protein and TI activity are enhanced as the crop matures. On the
other hand, sucrose concentration builds-up at the vegetable stage and eventually declines
later. Therefore, it is imperative to harvest vegetable soybean at the right stage to retain its
sweet taste. Frozen soybean contains substantial sucrose (e.g. 1.7% versus 1.1%) and
amino acids (e.g. alanine at 30 mg per 100g fresh weight versus 16 mg per 100g fresh
weight) than fresh. Delays in the harvest of edamame eventually results in low sucrose

content (Shanmugasundaram and Yan, 2010).

According to Shanmugasundaram er al., (1991) with their experience in doing
vegetable soybean research, the following traits are considered to be a close-to-ideal plant
type in the tropics as well as in Taiwan: (1) non lodging strong stem with good root system;
(2) delayed flowering > 40 days; (3) ten to fourteen nodes; (4) fewer branches; (5) large
narrow leaflets; (6) Longer R6 to R7 period; (7) less sensitive to photoperiod and
temperature; (8) with 400,000 plants/ha about which possess around 15-20 pods/plant; (9)
pod width of > 1.4 cm; (10) pod length of > 5.0 cm; (11) predominantly (= 75%) two- or
more seeded pods; (12) bright green pod and seed coat color; (13) gray pubescence; (14)
gray or light brown hilum; (15) easy to strip pods; (16) pod clearance from the soil at least
10 cm; (17) resistance to bacterial pustule and downy mildew; (18) tolerant to soybean
rust; (19) dry weight of 100 seeds > 30 g; (20) free from undesirable pigmentation and

or/spots on stem or pods and (21) preferably lipoxygenase null.

Cultivar Selection and Crop Establishment

For a commercially viable edamame production, farmers will need suitable
genotypes which can perform well with their environment. The time of floral set in
edamame from different maturity groups largely depend on the elevation to which they are
cultivated as well as the photoperiodic conditions (Cregan and Hartwig, 1984). In the US,
there are numerous research that provides evidence that vegetable soybean suitability is

based on where they are grown. For instance, cultivars grown in Washington State may not

10

perform well Georgia and, similarly, genotypes suited for production Georgia conditions
may not be appropriate for growing in Louisiana. Such differences in the suitability of
different vegetable cultivars to a specific location is due to the response of soybean to
photoperiodism (Board and Settimi, 1986). In China, for the past 20 years, 51 vegetable
soybean cultivars suitable for growing in various ecological regions have been released.
There were 25 cultivars identified as adapted for production in South China, 12 cultivars
in Central China, 10 cultivars in North China, and 4 cultivars in Northeast China. However.
the absence of suitable vegetable soybean cultivars prevents its commercial production in
China, and there are around 500 vegetable soybean germplasms are accessible for breeding
purpose (Zhang et al., 2013).

As compared to early-season responses, vegetable soybean will become smaller in
terms of height than the grain type at R6 stage. Interestingly, genotypes with smaller
canopy tend to be more beneficial when harvested using mechanical harvesters (Mbuvi and
Litchfield, 1994). So, in this case, height of the plants as well as lowest pod height are
significant traits in the selection of cultivars for commercial production. In contrast, if
harvesting is made by hand, usually plant size and lowest pod height does not, but when
the crop is to be mechanically harvested, plant size and lowest pod height turns out to be
an important factor in maintaining harvest efficiency. In connection, studies of Zandonadi
et al., (2010) demonstrated that tall plants can have a negative effect on harvest efficiency.
Pods that are bright green with gray pubescence, measuring 5.0 cm long and 1.4 cm wide
containing two or brighter green seeds, have light buff or gray hila commands higher prices

in the market (Shanmugasundaram, 1996; Wu et al., 2000).

11

Edamame cultivars are often subjected to poor crop establishment as observed in
various environments (Rao ef al., 2002; Sanchez ef al., 2005; Zhang er al., 2013).
Edamame’s establishment in the field can be negatively affected by poor germination
(Crawford and Williams, 2019; Williams e/ al., 2012). Poor emergence in vegetable
soybean is attributed to poor germination, longer length of hypocotyl and root during
emergence and sensitivity to planting depth found to be higher compared to grain-type
soybeans (Zhang ef al., 2013). At present, edamame growers depend heavily on planting
depth recommendations for grain-type soybean not considering the clear distinguishing
features in seed characters between the two different types of soybeans which is the seed
size. In a study by Crawford and Williams (2019), they found that the size of the seed did
not affect total emergence, although small seeds emerged 10% faster than larger seeds. A
recommended planting depth for grain soybean at 3.2 to 4.5 cm may not be applicable to
vegetable soybean because they tend to emerge quickly and completely at the shallowest
depths tested.

In Northeastern USA, it is recommended to sow seeds at a depth of 1-inch for
vegetable soybeans which influence the fresh pod yield at the R6 stage when planted
between the first to the last sowing date. Late sowing confers extended dry matter
accumulation for one or two weeks. Also, it is important to note that later sowing date
extended the duration of transition from the R6 stage to a fully mature seed as observed in
Massachussetts (Zhang ef al., 2010).

In terms of required soil pH for edamame, 6.0 value is the most ideal (Miles er al.,

2006). An area that has not been recently cultivated with legumes as well as Rhizobia

12

inoculation at a rate of 10 g/ka seed improves nitrogen fixation ability in vegetable soybean.
(Lal er al, 2001). Without a doubt, the improvement of existing currently available cultivar
can be achieved through creating new ways of improving crop establishment that are
essentially useful for vegetable soybean production and crop improvement involving
traditional plant breeding method or integrated with molecular approaches (Ogles er al.,

2016).

Effects of Planting Dates

Certain agronomic practices are believed to influence the quality and flavor of
vegetable soybean (Duppong and Hatterman- Valenti, 2005). In the case of grain soybeans,
planting date is an important factor affecting soybean grain yield and grain quality (Li er
al., 2014). While variation in soybean planting date is expected to impact the pattern of
soybean growth and development, very few reports have been examined in vegetable
soybean (Zhang et al. 2010).

Soybean is a thermophilic plant whereby the rate of development is controlled by
three cardinal temperatures: minimum temperature (To which means base temperature),
below which soybeans does not develop; optimum temperature (Top), in which soybean
developed at the highest rate; and maximum temperature (Tmax), above which development
ceased. Optimum temperature has been reported between 22 and 32 °C while maximum

temperature requirement reported values between 40 and 47°C (Setiyono e/ al., 2007).

13

In Japan, the yielding ability of green soybean in an open field is influenced by
sowing time in adverse weather conditions (low temperature or rainfall). With the delay in
sowing time. number of pods set, and the green soybean yield will likely decrease.
However, regardless of sowing time, the yield of vegetable soybeans tends to increase
when given large quantities of nitrogen topdressing (Nishioka and Okumura, 2008).

Ina study by Zhang et al. (2010) they found that the decrease in marketable yield
of vegetable soybean by 34 to 55 kg per ha per d was due to late planting which corresponds
to a reduction of two-seed and three-seed pods. As per cultivars with high ability to
maintain more 2-seeded pods, they may be advantageous to late or delayed planting. In
addition, planting after 15 May boost seed protein content by 4.1% to 7.5% and reduced
oil content by 2.4 to 26.3% for different cultivars. The contents of free amino acid, some
of fructose and glucose, raffinose, and stachyose in seed were also increased by late
planting. On the other hand, late planting decreased the sucrose level of the seed by 7.6%
to 45.5% on various cultivars. By contrast, fresh pod yield as well as sucrose content of the
seed was increase when planted on May 3. The results revealed that late planting in May
perhaps negatively affected the eating quality of the vegetable soybeans. In the market,
vegetable soybean with high sucrose content is related to eating quality and is mostly
preferred in the market. Therefore, the possible negative impact on the eating quality of
vegetable soybean caused by late planting should always be put into attention (Li ev al.
2014).

Reports of Egli and Cornelius (2009) also dealt with how planting date affected

soybean yield which differed from year to year in relation to the variation of environmental

14

conditions (most likely due to the amount of rainfall and distribution). They also showed
that yield at all times will decrease with delayed planting when looking at the research on
planting date for the past 35 years.

De Bruin and Pedersen (2008) found soybean yield declined 70 kg-ha"'-week"!
when planting date was delayed between late April and early May in Iowa. Soybean yield
was severely reduced when the planting date was delayed to late May or early June in the
upper Midwest (Lueschen ef al., 1992).

In relation to the chemical composition of the seeds, there were changes in the
content of protein, oil, carbohydrate, and other chemical components in seed as well as its
influence on the growth and development patterns of soybean as affected by planting dates
(Hu and Wiatrak, 2012; Kumar et al., 2006). Bellaloui et al. (2011) demonstrated that early
planting enhanced seed oil content by 16% than that of late planting under irrigated
conditions, whereas at late planting, oil content was found to be reduced (Kumar et al.,
2006; Tremblay ef al., 2006). Also, different temperature under a specific planting date
affected the oil content of soybeans especially during the seed filling stage (Kane er al.,
1997; Muhammad ef al., 2009).

For proteins, in contrast to the oil content, delayed planting tends to increase protein
content across years and cultivars (Kane et al., 1997; Muhammad er al., 2009). In contrast,
Tremblay et al. (2006) revealed that delayed planting did not affect the soybean protein
content when planted from mid-May to mid-June. The focus of those studies mentioned
were more on the yield and quality of grain soybeans. There is less information available

for vegetable soybeans specifically on fresh pod yield and seed quality (Li ef al., 2014).

15

Physiologically speaking, the reduction in marketable yield of vegetable soybean
in response to late sowing can be pointed out to the following reasons: (1) a shorter season
length that leads to overall reduction in growth; (2) short days accompanied by low
radiation and low temperature which results into slower growth rates and lower pod set,
and (3) a dramatic reduction on the relative duration of key phenological stages resulted

from reduced photoperiod (Kantolic and Slafer, 2001; Calvino ef a/., 2003).

Timing of Harvest

Harvesting of vegetable soybeans is time specific, laborious, and time consuming
(Mebrahtu and Mullins, 2007). The timing of harvest in vegetable soybean is very
important since sucrose concentration increases in the early stages which peaks at or after
35 days after floral set. (Chiba, 1991; Zhang ef al., 2015). There is a short window for
optimal harvesting which is just between 35-39 days after flowering. Sugar levels usually
drops after harvest mostly at high temperature which is therefore imperative to take
measure in preserving bean quality by means of cooling and high humidity storage. (Chiba,
1991).

The marketability and acceptability of vegetable soybeans by consumers as greatly
affected by the time they are harvested from the field (Mbuvi and Litchfield, 1995). The
appropriate time for harvesting fresh vegetable soybean with the best product quality
having maximum yield are in most cases affected by dynamic relationship between

maturity. yield, and quality parameters (Lee, 1989). On the other hand, the seed quality in

16

terms of color, texture, and seed size of vegetable soybean largely depends upon
development time (Mbuvi and Litchfield, 1995). Shanmugasundaram (1996) pointed that
the best time for harvesting green beans was when the pods are still green, immature, and
tight with fully developed immature green seeds. This stage corresponds to the R6 stage of
soybean development (Fehr and Caviness, 1977). Hence. the R6 stage is very crucial for
ensuring good yield of beans that are of good quality. Among physical characteristics, the

appearance and size of fresh pods and seeds significant.

Chemical Composition of Vegetable Soybean Seeds

In developing cultivars for healthy conscious people, researchers must be able to
understand edamame chemical composition of the seed at its edible stage (Li et al., 2012).
Among the biomolecules, protein and oil contents are the most important quality traits of
vegetable soybean which are valuable to edamame breeders. The protein content of
vegetable soybean was 56% greater as compared to green peas (P. sativum) (Masuda,
1991). Studies of Rao et al. (2002) reported that protein and oil content of vegetable
soybean fresh seed are between 33 to 39% and 13 to 16%, respectively. In developed
countries, people who pursue healthy diets opted for vegetable soybean genotypes with
lower oil percentage and relatively higher protein content (Brar and Cater, 1993). Saldivar
et al. (2011) reported that vegetable soybean seed which contains 45% protein and seed oil

of lower than 18% are acceptable.

17

Abe et al. (2005) found that the levels of B-conglycicin-B-subunits and sucrose
binding proteins of vegetable-type soybean were around 70 and 75%, respectively, as
compared to grain-type cultivars. The quantitative reduction of 7s globulin levels resulted
in the upsurge of 11s over 7s which is preferable for its nutritional value.

In the case of the 3 vegetable soybean grown in Virginia, carbohydrates were the
chief component which is in between 42.4 to 48.1%, followed by protein (34.2-35.4%), oil
(13.1-17.5 %) and ash (4.21-4.88%). The predominant sugars in the beans are sucrose
(5.94-12.2%) and fructose (1.61-2.31%) (Xu ef al., 2015). The total soluble sugar content
in a four-year study in Taiwan was 6.0% to 7.4% (Tsou and Hong, 1991) and 7.5% to
12.5% in a three-year study in China (Zhang et al., 2006). Meanwhile, sucrose content
shares 71% of total soluble sugar (Li ef al., 2012). In addition, the seed protein. oil, total
soluble sugar (TSS) and sucrose content of vegetable soybean genotypes (lines) were 420,
186, 60 and 43 mg per gram, respectively (Li ef al., 2012).There is a noteworthy directly
proportional amounts between sugar and oil in seed and it appears to be a challenging task
in developing a high sucrose and high protein vegetable soybean with corresponding low
oil content. However, the results reported by other researchers showed a negative
relationship between sugar and oil. As a matter of fact, Shanmugasundaram et al. (2001)
stated that the correlation coefficient between sugar and oil content was -0.50. On the other
hand, correlation coefficient between sugar and protein content was -0.15 but significant
only in 6 out of 20 entries. Similarly, negative correlations were found between protein and
TSS (r=-0.52), protein and sucrose (r=-0.43) (Li et al/., 2012). It was further revealed that

for every 10 mg g' increase in seed protein, there is a concomitant reduction in sucrose

18

(4.3 mg g’'). In contrast, there were no significant correlation (P>0.05) was observed
between oil and TSS, and oil and sucrose. Therefore, it would be feasible to breed vegetable
soybean cultivars that are high in sucrose, lower in oil content without reduced protein
content (Zhang et al., 2017).

Vegetable soybean has superior nutritional content than green peas as revealed in
the proximate analysis of seed nutritional composition (Johnson ef al., 1999; Masuda.
1991). Isoflavones are comparably higher in vegetable soybeans that mature soybean seeds
(Koes ef al., 2005: Wu et al., 2004). The content of isoflavones was 78 to 220 g/g dried
seed) and tocopherols (vitamin E) ranged from 84 to 128 g/g dry seed (Mohamed ef al.,
2001). Soybean variety and environmental conditions both affect the individual isoflavone
contents (Lee ef al., 2003). Kim et al. (2007) found a total average concentration of
isoflavone was 2887 g/g in embryo, 5751 wg/g in whole seed, 325 g/g in cotyledon, and
33 g/g in seed coat. Isoflavones accumulated in the order of malonylglycoside, glycoside,
acetylglycoside, and aglycon, in which, malonylglycoside was found to be predominant
ranging from 66 to 79% of the total isoflavone content across all three tissues.

Vegetable soybean has a calorific value that is 6 times greater than the green peas.
In addition, vegetable soybean possesses 60% more calcium, 2 times greater amount of
phosphorous and potassium in comparison to green peas. Unlike green peas, vegetable
soybean has also 1/3 higher sodium and carotene content, although they have similar
amounts of iron, vitamins B1 and B2. Aside from that. Vegetable soybean is also rich in

ascorbic acid but lesser in niacin (Masuda, 1991; Zhang and Kyei-Boahen, 2007).

19

Edamame is one of only a handful of plant-based foods that has all the essential
amino acids most especially lysine and tryptophan (which is lacking in rice and wheat),
has high sugar content, has high amounts of minerals and is as an excellent source of
secondary metabolites (Zhang et al. 2017). In connection, studies of Masuda and Harada
(2001) examined 46 edamame cultivars, ‘Chakari’ and ‘Murasaki’ (Dadacha-mame) which
had sucrose concentrations of 16 g per 100 g dry weight, which is twice the amount found
in grain-type cultivar ‘Enrei’. In addition, they also reported that there was an enzymatic
generation of maltose from starch in the green beans of starch-rich edamame cultivars
‘Tanbakuro’ and ‘Koitozairai’; a quality which is highly sought after in vegetable
soybeans.

Akazawa et al. (1997) observed that vegetable soybeans have higher levels of
water-soluble nitrogen than grain soybean. Also, phytic acid levels are greater in vegetable

soybean compared to grain soybean making the tender beans to cook faster.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Experimental Setup and Plant Materials

The experimental plots were laid at Bagontaas. Valencia City (7°57'12.89" N and
125°5'42.89"E) Bukidnon, Philippines with an elevation of 333.15 m above sea level. The
experimental area was previously grown to sugarcane. Results of soil analysis showed
appropriate amounts of N and P. but not with K which recommended 45 kg ha’!. Potassium
requirements was satisfied by applying 0-0-60 (muriate of potash). Additionally, the soil
has a pH of 6.54 and contained 2.0% organic matter (see Appendix P).

Seeds of grain soybeans were obtained from Department of Agriculture’s Northern
Mindanao Agricultural Crops and Livestock Research Center Complex (DA-NMACLRC).
There were 5 grain soybean genotypes used such as AGS 374 Manchuria, Tiwala 8, Tiwala
12, and Tudela Black. The edamame variety (Ryokko) was supplied by Kaneko Seeds Co.,
Ltd. Japan. The brief description of these genotypes is presented in Table 1. Seeds of grain
soybean were manually selected for defects, subjected to sun-drying to reduce moisture
content, and kept in low temperature to prolong viability for several months.

The field was prepared for planting by passing a disc plow followed by an animal
drawn plow to create furrows. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete
block design (RCBD) replicated 4 times. The experimental plots consisted of 4 rows

measuring 2 meters in length and spaced 0.50 m apart. Each experimental plot was spaced.

weeks, each hill was thinned to 2 plants, which has an estimated of 160,000 plants ha’.

Soybeans were planted based on 4 planting schemes which include September 11, 2021.

November 15, 2021; January 19, 2022, and May 2, 2022.

Furthermore, climatic data were obtained by setting up onsite an RS-I72

temperature and humidity data logger (RS Components, Corby, United Kingdom) (Figure

2a) housed in a modified Stevenson screen (Figure 2b) and a fabricated manual rain gauge

(Figure 2c).

Harvesting

Soybeans were harvested at R6 stage of development as described by Fehr and
Caviness (1977) where pods are still green, immature, and tight with fully developed
immature green seeds (Table 2). In addition, R6 is when pods contain green seeds that fill
the pod cavity at one of the four upper nodes on the main stem with a fully developed leaf.
Harvesting was done using a pruning shear by cutting the base of the plant directly above
the soil. A total of 10 experimental plants were randomly sampled from the 2 middle rows
excluding those plants located at each end of the row. The plants were brought to the

laboratory for collection of agronomic parameters.

Data Collection

Number of Days to R1 and R6 Stage and corresponding Growing Degree Days

The number of days attained to reach the R1 and R6 development stage was counted
from the sowing date. Growing degree days (GDD) or accumulated heat units was
computed beginning from sowing to R1, R6, and R1 to R6 stage of soybean development.

GDD was computed using the equation below:

Gpp= L[ toa S Ton Eoin |-%

Tmax depicts the maximum air temperature (°C); 7mm depicts the minimum (°C); and
Tp is the base temperature (°C). The lower base temperature (7») of 10°C was used

specifically for soybeans as prescribed by Bhan et al. (2019).

Morpho-physiological Parameters

Plant height was measured at R1 (beginning bloom) stage characterized by having
at least 1 open flower at any node on the main stem. The final plant height was obtained at
harvest or during the R6 (full seed) stage when pods contain green seeds that fills the pod
cavity at one of the four upper nodes on the main stem with a fully developed leaf. Plant
height were taken by measuring the above-ground parts only from the base to the shoot tip.

The number of nodes on the main branch (excluding those of the lateral branches)
were counted during R6 stage of development. The length of internodes were obtained by

dividing the plant height at R6 to the number of nodes plant.

28

Biomass
Fresh weight of whole plants (only the above-ground parts) including their pods

were obtained using a digital weighing scale.

Yield and Yield Components

Fresh weight of pods plant and number of pods plant”! were recorded using a
digital weighing scale and by manual counting, respectively. After which, pods were
subsequently sorted to separate pods containing either 1-, 2-. 3-. and even 4-seeded pods.
Percentage 1-, 2-. 3-. and 4-seeded pods were computed against the total number of pods
plant’! and subsequently multiplied by 100.

After counting the sorted pods based on the number of seeds, pods having two and
three seeds were considered standard pod or marketable, while pods with one or, without
seeds, and those with pod discoloration, small seeds, insect damaged, and abnormal pods
were not classified as marketable pods. The number of marketable pods plant”! was divided
by the total number of pods plant”! multiplied by 100. In addition, marketable pods were
weighed, and percentage marketable weight of pods was derived.

Remaining fresh pods were then combined and randomly sampled with 100-pods
and 100-seeds and weighed subsequently. These pods and seeds were oven dried for 72
hours at 80 °C to get the constant weight. The percentage moisture content (on a fresh
weight basis) of seeds was also derived by using this formula: MC = [((FW-ODW)/FW] x

100, where. FW = fresh weight of pods/seed; and ODW = oven-dried weight.

29

The length, width, and thickness of 20 randomly picked pods per replication were
measured using a transparent ruler for the length and caliper for the width and thickness
(Figure 3). In addition, 20 shelled sizes of fresh seeds were measured by taking the length

and thickness of pods using a caliper.

Harvest Index (HI)

Harvest index is a measure of the efficiency of plants in producing economic yield
which are the green pods in the case of vegetable soybeans. It is defined as the ratio of
fresh pod to the total above-ground biomass expressed in kilograms. Harvest index was

obtained per plant basis. This was computed following the formula:

Economic Yield or Total Green Pod Weight/Plant

Seed Quality

Oil Content. The oil content was determined using a Soxhlet apparatus. Green seeds
of soybeans were first dried in a forced air oven at 80°C for 72 hours and weighed to get
the moisture content. The samples were homogenized using a seed grinder until it became
powdered. One gram of the dried samples was weighed and placed inside a weighted filter
paper thimble and then on a Soxhlet apparatus. The extraction was done using 200-ml
petroleum ether boiled at 350°C for about 8-hours. The paper thimbles were then removed
and placed inside a forced-air oven at 50°C for 3-4 hours or until the ether was completely
evaporated from the thimbles. The paper thimbles with the samples were equilibrated in a
desiccator for about 30 minutes and then weighed. The weight of the oil in samples will be
expressed in mg g”'. This procedure was triplicated for each block per treatment.

Total Proteins. Protein content was determined using a modified Kjeldahl method.
Fifty (50) mg of defatted samples was poured in a 30 ml digestion flask. Five hundred
(500) mg of selenium catalyst (1g selenium:10 g copper sulfate:100 g potassium sulfate)
and 2 ml concentrated sulfuric acid were added to the digestion tubes. Tubes were digested
at 400°C until the solution eventually turns clear green. Tubes were then cooled at room
temperature.

The digestion tubes were adjusted to 10 ml by adding distilled water and mixed
until the solution was clear, and then transferred to 10 x 15 mm test tubes. Ten (10) pl
aliquot was obtained from the digested solution and added with a 1.5 ml working buffer
containing 2 solutions (solution | consisted of 7.095 g sodium phosphate, 2 g sodium

hydroxide. and 25.4 g sodium potassium tartrate dissolved in 205 ml distilled water: while

31

solution 2 contained 25 g NaOH dissolved in 250 ml distilled water) and 0.40 ml
nitroprusside reagent (20 g sodium salicylate and 0.030 g sodium nitroprusside). The
solution was vortexed for several seconds to homogenized thoroughly the mixture. Sodium
hypochlorite (2.5% NaOCl) solution was added at 0.20 ml to induce color change in the
mixture. Tubes were then incubated for 30 minutes, diluted to 10 ml by adding distilled
water and vortexed again. Finally, the absorbance of the samples was read at 660 nm using
a UV-VIS Spectrophotometer. The following equation will be used to compute first for the

% nitrogen content.

Where: Slopesa = ug Nitrogen/unit absorbance
*The % nitrogen was converted to protein by multiplying with 6.25. The final data for
protein will be expressed as mg g”'.

Total Sugar Content. The total sugar content of seeds was measured using anthrone-
sulfuric acid test. Fifty (50) mg of powdered defatted samples was placed into 13x10 mm
test tube. Extraction of sugars from the sample was done by adding 5 mL 80% ethanol to
the test tubes and vortexing at high speed for 2 minutes. The extraction procedure was
repeated 2 times. The extract was then decanted to the small vials for analysis.

For the analysis of total sugar, 0.10 mL of aliquot was obtained from the sugar
extract into an 18x 10 mm test tube. The aliquot was adjusted to 1 mL by adding 0.90 mL
distilled water. The solution was then vortexed briefly. Three (3) mL anthrone reagent
(0.20 g anthrone dissolved in 100 mL of 95% pure/concentrated sulfuric acid) was added
to the aliquot solution at the center and once again vortexed briefly at a lower speed. After

which, the test tubes were covered with marbles and heated in a boiling water bath for 10

32

minutes. After hot water bath, the tubes were placed in an ice-cold water bath to stop the
reaction for 15 minutes. The tubes were then cooled at room temperature for 45 minutes.
Finally, the absorbance of the anthrone-sugar solution was measured at 630 nm. Glucose
solution was used as the standard at 100 pg mL"!. The total sugar content was computed
using the equation below.

Statistical Analysis

Data sets for the varietal differences and different planting dates were combined
and analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) if variances were homogenous on each
planting date. Treatment means were separated using Least Significant Difference (LSD)
Test at p<0.05 level of probability. In addition, Pearson Correlation Analysis of the plant
characters were also performed. Statistical analyses were processed using STAR 2.0.1 -

Statistical Tool for Agricultural Research software (2014, IRRI, Los Bafios, Laguna).

CHAPTER 4

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Meteorological Data

The historical 30-years (1991-2021) average rainfall and temperature data is
presented in Figure 4. The previous 30-years rainfall pattern revealed an abundance of
precipitation in the month of July (345 mm) followed by June (317 mm). By contrast,
rainfall was recorded to be lowest in the month of March (103 mm) followed by February
(119 mm) and April (120 mm). Rainfall pattern indicated that May is the start of the rainy
season peaking in July whereas dry season begins from February until April. Mean monthly
temperature was highest in May (25.3°C) while the lowest was recorded in the month of

January (23.5°C).

Figure 6. Daylength conditions throughout different planting dates

Total rainfall and mean monthly temperature of each planting date is shown in
Figure 5 while the mean monthly daylength is presented in Figure 6. Planting dates 1, 2, 3,
and 4 began on September, November 2021, January. and May 2022. respectively. During

the first planting. the heaviest rainfall (516 mm) was recorded in the month of November

35

2021 in which all soybean genotypes were on their final phase of reproductive stage. The
lowest precipitation (195 mm) was logged in the month September 2021. November 2021
had the greatest mean monthly temperature (25.99°C) whereas September 2021 had 0.24°C
lower mean temperature. In relation to average daylength conditions, a declining trend was
observed from September to November 2021 which had 12.1 and 11.8 hrs daylength.
respectively.

On the 2" planting, November 2021 notably had the heaviest precipitation (516
mm). In contrast, December 2021 received very minimal rainfall (77 mm), hence. manual
watering was done frequently. The early reproductive development coincided with
December 2021. Meanwhile, a notable increase (141 mm) in precipitation was observed a
month after. The highest mean monthly temperature was recorded in January 2022
(25.96°C) and the lowest was noted in December 2021 (25.36°C). Daylength condition on
the other hand was the lowest (11.7 hrs) during this planting date specifically on the month
of December 2021 and January 2022. Water deficit and shorter daylength on the 2"¢
planting date had a significant negative impact on the phenology, morpho-physiology, and
yield of vegetable soybeans. The reproductive stage shows the largest sensitivity to a
possible yield loss during water deficit, while deficit during the flowering stage has a slight
negative impact on yield (Lich er a/., 2013). Nevertheless, water deficit as experienced by
plants during pod enlargement and seed filling will negatively affect the final yield and
yield components of soybeans (Andrade et a/., 2002).

On the 3 planting, January and February 2022 had the lowest accumulated rainfall

of 141 mm and 163 mm, respectively. Rainfall was the highest in April 2022 (539 mm)

36

followed by March 2022 (382 mm). By early April 2022, only Tiwala 8 and Tudela Black
remained on the field and all other soybean genotypes were already harvested by the end
of March 2022. Interestingly, March and April 2022 were unusually wet since this was
supposed to be the “summer” months in Bukidnon. Such pattern can be observed in the 30-
years historical data (Figure 3). The mean monthly temperature was the highest during
March 2022 (26.03°C) while February was cooler at 24.94°C. Daylength conditions during
the 3“ planting had a 0.2 hrs increment from January to April 2022 (11.7 to 12.3 hrs).

The 4" planting date was reported to be the wettest among all planting dates where
it recorded 667 mm on the month of July. In total. the last planting received a total rainfall
of 1.442 mm. On the other hand, growth temperature was highest specifically in the month
May and June with 26.44 and 26.45°C. Longer daylengths was also observed during this
planting date ranging from 12.5 to 12.6 hrs. High rainfall, growth temperature, and longer
daylength had a significant implication on the vegetable soybean’s phenology, physio-
morphology, yield, and quality. Planting date is a significant factor which has a greater
influence on soybean yield (Egli & Bruening, 1992). During the post anthesis stage of
soybeans, the possible influence of climate change is highly associated to the mean
temperature (Hatfield er al., 2011). Temperature has a direct impact on growth and
development of crops and could significantly alter plant phenology (Pathak and Stoddard,
2018). Additionally, according to Carmello ef al., (2016) rainfall together with temperature
are the primary factors responsible for the grain yield fluctuations mostly occurring in the

tropics.

37

Growing Degree Days (GDD)

Growing degree days (GDD) measures the heat requirement of crops for growth
and development. Examining the GDD at various stages of crop growth, analysis of the
relationship between GDD and crop growth, and establishment of appropriate growth
models to determine the right planting time in different regions are crucial to obtain
information regarding crop growth, accurate yield prediction, and increasing yield. GDD
can be used to determine suitable sowing date. growth period, and corresponding
physiological characteristics of crops under specified climatic conditions (Liu et al. 2020).
The required GDD to reach sowing to RI and R6. and RI to R6 stage (Figure 7) revealed
a significant interaction between genotypes and planting dates at P<0.05. Soybean
genotypes on average required a mean of 628.28°C, 1271.40°C, and 643.61 °C to attain
the R1, R6, and from R1 to R6 stage of development, respectively.

A consistent increase in the GDD accumulation to reach R1 was observed among
soybeans when planted in May 2022, with Ryokko as an exception. Planting in May 2022
was comparably warmer than the rest of the growing seasons accompanied by heavy
precipitation. On the other hand, planting in November 2021 had much lower GDD
requirements for floral initiation to occur in late maturing genotypes including Manchuria,
Tiwala 8, and Tudela Black. For AGS 374, all the rest of the planting dates had similar
GDD requirements to attain R1. In the case of Tiwala 12, the lowest GDD requirement to
RI stage during January 2022 planting. Among soybean genotypes Tudela Black required

the highest accumulate GDD when sown in September 2021 and May 2022 with 750°C

and 896°C, respectively. However, planting in November 2021 and January 2022, both

Tudela Black and Tiwala 8 were statistically tied in relation to their GDD requirements in

order to initiate flowers. Furthermore, Ryokko consistently required the lowest

accumulated GDD among soybean genotypes with a range of 420°C to 442°C. Ina similar

39

manner, soybeans that accumulated the highest GDD to reach R1 stage also translated to a
higher GDD accumulation to reach R6. On average, soybeans accumulated 1,271°C to
attain R6 stage. Planting soybeans in May 2022 accumulated the highest GDD to reach R6
in comparison to other planting dates with Ryokko as an exception. Ryokko sown in
September 2021 and January 2022 significantly necessitated higher GDD by 39°C
compared to those planted in November 2021 and May 2022. Conversely, planting
soybeans in November 2021 greatly reduced GDD for all soybean genotypes tested.
Further, Tiwala 8 and Tudela Black exhibited a higher GDD requirement to reach R6. On
the other hand, Ryokko and Tiwala 12 consistently had the lowest GDD requirement to
attain the R6 stage.

The GDD required to reach R1 to R6 stage was also the highest on May 2022
plantings, with Ryokko as an exception. Although in the case of Manchuria and Tudela
Black, January 2022 also showed similar statistical response to the fourth planting date.

The result of this experiment indicated that accumulated GDD will be higher if ever
a certain phenological stage is extended (e.g., sowing to R1, sowing to R6, and R1 to R6).
Zhang ef al., (2001) suggested that the greater the thermal requirement for flowering, the
more the plant produced vegetative biomass. Such finding was observed during September
2021 and May 2022 across all soybean genotypes tested leading to an increase in fresh
biomass. Growing degreed days (GDD) were found to be stronger predictors of the
development of phenological phases than calendar days which was closely followed by
GDD (Ramesh and Gopalaswamy, 1991). Their research unequivocally demonstrated that

temperature, more so than any other element, governs the growth and developmental

40

phases of soybean, even outweighing the influence of photoperiod. However, according to
Irmak ef al., (2013) GDD as the basis for predicting soybean growth and development may
not be adequate since they are affected by growing season temperature as well as by

daylength. In addition,

Phenology

Number of Days to R1, R6, and from R1 to R6

Crop phenology is controlled both by both climatic factors and agronomic
management practices such as planting date and varietal characteristics (He ef al., 2020).
The R1 (beginning bloom) stage of development is characterized by the presence of at least
one open flower at any node on the main stem (Fehr and Caviness, 1977). Both planting
dates and soybean genotypes showed an interaction effect on the number of days required
to reach R1 (beginning bloom) at P<0.05 (Figure 8). On average, the R1 stage was attained
by soybean at 36.85 days after planting. Planting in May 2022 delayed flowering in all
genotypes tested except for Ryokko. On the other hand, flowering was accelerated when
planted on November 2021 especially for late flowering genotypes Tiwala 8 and Tudela
Black. In addition, flowering of Tiwala 12 and AGS 374 began earlier when sown in
September 2021. For Manchuria, flowering was earlier when sown in January 2022.

In terms of varietal differences, Ryokko was observed to initiate flowers ahead of

other genotypes ranging from 23.60 days to 25.89 days which were consistent on all

planting dates. By contrast, Tudela Black bloomed later (39.50 days to 50.67 days) than

other genotypes across all planting dates although statistically tied with Tiwala 8 in

November 2021 and January 2022 plantings. The results of this experiment were similar

to observations of Williams (2015) where vegetable soybeans (Ryokko) achieved R1 faster

42

than the grain-type soybeans (AGS 374, Manchuria, Tiwala 12, Tiwala 8, and Tudela
Black).

The number of days to reach the R6 stage was likewise significantly affected by the
interaction between genotypes and planting dates at P<0.05 (Figure 8). Similar pattern was
observed among genotypes such as AGS 374, Manchuria, Tiwala 8, and Tudela Black in
attaining R6 among planting dates. Sowing these genotypes in November 2021 accelerated
R6 stage while May 2022 delayed it. Ryokko and Tiwala 12 had varying responses to
planting dates to achieve R6. A varied response to planting dates was observed in Tiwala
12 and Ryokko to different planting dates. On the other hand, The results of this
experiment revealed that the late maturing genotypes were Tudela Black, Tiwala 8, and
Manchuria requiring 82 days, 83 days, and 77 days to reach R6. On the other hand, Tiwala
12, and Ryokko where early maturing genotypes necessitates 71 days, and 62 days to reach
the full-seed stage.

The number of days for soybeans to transition from R1 to R6 was also considerably
influenced by both genotypes and planting dates (Figure 8). Planting of AGS 374,
Manchuria, Tiwala 8, and Tudela Black in November 2021 reached from R1 to R6 earlier
that required 31.23 days, 34.52 days, 36.02 days, and 31.52 days, respectively. Tiwala 12
developed faster from R1 into R6 stage when sown both in September and November 2021.

Interestingly, for Ryokko, a faster transition from R1 to R6 was observed both in
September 2021, and May 2022. Such observation was opposite to what was observed with
the other soybean genotypes tested. On the other hand, the slowest reproductive

development from R1 to R6 was observed in May 2022 on AGS 374 (42 days). Tiwala 12

43

(40.13 days), and Tiwala 8 (43.06 days). Manchuria and Tudela Black exhibited longer
transition from R1 to R6 in January 2022 planting at about 43.18 days and 41.41 days,
respectively.

Floral induction or the beginning bloom stage (R1) in soybeans is mainly regulated
by temperature, photoperiod, and genetics (Kumidini, 2010). Selection of proper planting
date determines the availability of light (photoperiod) and temperature during the growth
and the development of soybean plants which also dictates the correct course of
phenological phases. It influences the proper development of vegetative and generative
organs (Setiyono e/ al., 2007; Nico e¢ al., 2019). Increasing temperature generally
accelerates crop phenological development and shortens the growing period, which may
reduce crop productivity (Asseng e/ al., 2015). In a study by Board and Wall (1984) the
interaction between temperature and photoperiod indicated that warm temperature at
(27°C) decreased the time to first flowering (R1) compared to cold temperature (21°C).
The effects of warm temperature on R1 can be apparently observed during short-days rather
than long days. Contrast to this, a delay in flowering was observed in soybeans when
planted on May 2022 was characterized by having the heaviest rainfall (1,393 mm) and
high mean temperature (26.5°C) among the planting dates. In addition, an extended
phenological stage might be affected more likely by photoperiod which has an almost 13
hrs of daylength.

In a study with maize by Liu ef al., 2017, as the precipitation increases, the key

growth stages are also extended, while the growing season length of wheat increased with

44

an increase in rainfall and sunshine duration during the growing season. Such finding was
apparent on soybeans planted in May 2022 and September 2021.

Williams (2015) found that grain-type soybeans developed later than vegetable
soybeans. For instance, vegetable soybeans developed earlier on average by 6.2 to 7.0 days
to attain Rl. The days to reach R6 (time of commercial vegetable soybean harvest) was
reached shortly by 9.5 to 17.9 days than the grain-type entries. Therefore, the growing
season of vegetable soybean is shorter than grain-type soybean, not only because the crop
is harvested at an earlier growth stage (i.e., R6 vs. R8), but also because the crop reaches
the R6 growth stage earlier than grain-type soybean. In this study, grain-type soybeans

developed longer than the vegetable type soybean (Ryokko).

Morpho-Physiology

Plant Height at RI and R6

Statistically significant interaction effects between genotypes and planting dates
(P<0.05) were observed in relation to plant height at Rl and R6 (Figure 9) stage of
development. Mean plant height during R1 and R6 growth stages were 41.10 cm and 65.33
cm, respectively. Planting in May 2022 produced taller plants during R1 stage which was
consistent to every variety tested with Ryokko as an exception. Ryokko. produced taller
plants in May 2022 which was comparable to those planted in November 2021 and January
2022. Conversely, planting in November 2021 experienced a reduction in plant height

across different soybean genotypes tested. Specifically. height of AGS 374,

Manchuria, Tiwala 8, and Tudela Black in November 2021 greatly reduced plant height at
R1 by 16 cm, 22 cm, 25 cm, and 38 cm, respectively in comparison to May 2022 sowing.
Among soybean genotypes tested, Tudela Black was the tallest variety (57.77 cm) during

R1 followed by Tiwala 8 (46.88 cm) and Manchuria (47.37 cm). Ryokko on the other hand

was the shortest variety at R1 stage standing at 26.83 cm.

46

During R6, plant height in soybeans were statistically variable between planting
dates. Planting in May 2022 still surpassed other planting dates in terms of producing taller
plants. Apparently, for late maturing and tall soybean genotypes Tiwala 8 and Tudela
Black, a drop in plant height during R6 was apparent when sown in November 2021. Plant
height of Ryokko was seemed to be unaffected by the remaining planting dates, hence,
garnering the same statistical results. Reduction of plant height in Manchuria by 22 cm and
Tiwala 12 by 14 cm was observed when sown both in November 2021, and January 2022.
In contrast to R1, Tiwala 8 during R6 produced taller plants consistent across planting dates
which is comparable to Tudela Black. Ryokko, was still the shortest variety during R6
except for November 2021 where it statistically tied with Tudela Black. and Manchuria.
Interestingly, it was generally observed that there were only a few height differences
between genotypes. Ryokko, Tiwala 12, and AGS 374 grew plants of the same height.

Shoot architecture is fundamentally essential to crop growth, development, and
productivity. It is well recognized that both genetic and environmental factors affect plant
height, which is an important trait under shoot architecture. Plant height of soybean is also
an important agronomic character, which control the yield of soybean (Yang et al., 2021).
It can be established in this study that an extended phenological phase also increases
vegetative period of soybeans which has a major implication on their final yield. It is
generally observed in this study that prolonging the phenological phases also increased the
plant height of soybeans.

Ina study by Ahmed ef al., (2011) reported that plant height was different between

genotypes G-2 (67.7 cm) and TGx 1740-2F (40.3 cm). suggesting that the variation in plant

47

height was attributed to their genetic make-up. In addition, they reported no significant
interaction effect between planting date and genotype. In contrast, findings of this study
indicated significant interaction effect between planting dates and genotypes.

In temperate regions, a delay in planting dates also reduced plant height (Bastidas
et al., (2008). Additionally, Muhammad ef al., (2009) observed similar reduction in plant
height as sowing was delayed but demonstrated an increase in height by 19 cm when
planting was advanced by seven weeks from mid-June. A delay in planting resulted in
significant reduction in in biomass yield which has also a major implication on the yield of
soybeans. Although for some reason, plant height can be disadvantageous since plants will

become prone to lodging.

Number of Nodes at R6

A significant interaction effects between genotypes and planting dates as to the
number of nodes plant”! were detected at P<0.05 (Figure 10). Soybeans on average
produced 15.52 nodes plant’. Planting in May 2022 apparently increased the number of
nodes by up to 3 and 10 nodes in AGS 374 and Tiwala 8, respectively. In addition, sowing
Manchuria, Tiwala 12, and Tudela Black in September 2021 and May 2022 both enhanced
the node production by up to 3, 2-3, and 5-6 nodes per plant. Taller genotypes such as
Tiwala 8 and Tudela Black greatly reduced the number of nodes when sown in November
2021. AGS 374, Manchuria, and Tiwala 12 on the other hand comparably produced the
least number of nodes when sown both in November 2021 and January 2022. However,

node production in Ryokko was constant all throughout different planting dates.

Figure 10. Number of nodes plant! at R6 stage of vegetable soybeans as influenced by
genotypes and planting dates

The most numerous nodes were produced by Tiwala 8 (26.87 nodes) consistent across

planting dates. However, during the 1*' and 2" planting. they are statistically similar to

Tudela Black which produced an average of 19.88 nodes plant”. Contrarily, the least

number of nodes was produced by Ryokko with 9.03 nodes plant’! followed by either

Tiwala 12 and AGS 374 with 13.61 and 12.57 nodes plant’.

The formation of a node and associated leaf represents a new vegetative sink, which
has the potential for competing with reproductive plant parts for assimilates (Pedersen and
Lauer, 2009). Growing soybean during September to November 2021 and May to July
2022 have a pronounced higher mean daily temperature among planting dates leading to

The production of more nodes, except for Ryokko. Allen, ef al., (2018) reported
that elevated temperatures increased the number of nodes plant’! from 18 to 29 and to 40

per plant when the temperature was increased from 30/22°C to 38/30°C. and to 42/34°C

day/night regimes, respectively. Accordingly, growth temperature delayed maturity
process leading to more vegetative growth. This is also observed under long day condition.
Further, this phenomenon was also previously observed by early studies of Thomas and
Raper (1977) and Van Schaik and Probst (1958) where the number of main stem nodes.
plant height, and mean internode length of crops increase with increasing temperatures.
The number of nodes is an important morphological feature since it also determines the

final yield of soybeans.

Aboveground Biomass

Biomass accumulation and partitioning into reproductive structures are critical
aspects for plant fitness and they are also key determinants of crop yield (Vega er al., 2000).
The aboveground fresh biomass of soybeans was significantly affected by the interaction
between genotypes tested and planting dates at P<0.05 (Figure 11). On average, each plant
weighed about 118.27 g plant’. Seeding AGS 374, Manchuria, Ryokko, Tiwala 12, and
Tiwala 8 in September 202] and May 2022 produced heavier aboveground fresh biomass
of 133.13 g, 170.08 g, 92.315 g, 125.4 g, and 190.75 g plant", respectively in contrast to
other planting dates, except for Tudela Black. The fresh biomass of Tudela Black greatly
varies with each planting dates. Greater biomass in Tudela Black was recorded in May
2022 planting (213.50 g plant”), followed by September 2021 (185 g plant”) and
November 2021 having remarkably the lowest plant biomass of 77.05 g plant”.

Additionally, seeding AGS 374, Manchuria, Ryokko, and Tiwala 12 in November 2021

As per varietal difference performance across planting dates, Tiwala 8 and Tudela
Black being the late maturing genotypes had heavier fresh biomass immediately followed
by Manchuria specifically during the 1‘ and 4" planting. Interestingly, planting in
November 2021 had produced plants that are almost of similar fresh weights. The lowest
plant biomass was reported in Ryokko ranging from 52. 41 g to 98.05 g plant’.
Figure 13. Aboveground biomass of six soybean genotypes as influenced by planting dates
According to Liu er al., (2005) in the local conditions of Heilongjiang Province, for
the future selection of high-yielding cultivars, higher biomass is important, as this resulted
in an increased number of pod (and seed) per plant. This result in part agrees with Specht

et al. (1986) who stated that achieving a high total biomass through adequate vegetative

51

growth is an essential prerequisite for high reproductive growth and a high seed yield in
soybean. Plant biomass in this study also increased followed by an extended phenological
phase as observed during September 2021 and May 2022. Plant biomass has a significant

implication on the yield and harvest index of soybeans.

Internode Length

Internodal length was significantly influenced both by planting dates and genotypes
at P<(,05 (Figure 12). Planting in May 2022 significantly increased internodal length
across all soybean genotypes with some similar statistical results with September 2021
especially for Manchuria and Tiwala 8. A significant reduction in internodal length was
observed apparently in November 2021 especially for late maturing genotypes (Tiwala 8
and Tudela Black). As per varietal differences, Tiwala 8 demonstrated the highest
internodal length while AGS 374, Ryokko, Tiwala 12 showed the shortest internodal
length.

The length of internodes in soybeans is a function of both plant height and number
of nodes which maybe contributed by intraplant competition to light especially at higher
planting densities. Results of Shan et al., (2022) found that as planting density is increased,
the length of internodes changed significantly starting from the fifth internode. It also
decreased diameter-to-length ratio and GA3 content in the stem increased. This observation
was apparent in May 2022 planting where there was increase in vegetative biomass that
enhanced canopy coverage per plant leading to a competition in light. This has significantly

increased internodal length of plants.

both in November 2021 and January 2022 plantings. Pod production in Ryokko was found
to be unaffected by planting dates which yielded 22.69 pods plant’. Tiwala 12, Tiwala 8,

of pods plant" by up to 42%, 64% and 50%, respectively.

The late maturing and tall variety, Tudela Black consistently yielded the highest
pod numbers (103.68 pods plant’) throughout planting dates excluding that of November
2021 where it statistically tied with Tiwala 8 and Manchuria. Genotypes with the least pods
produced plant’ across planting dates were recorded in Ryokko and Tiwala 12 being the
earliest to reach both R1 and R6 which only produced 22.69 and 37.34 pods plant’,
respectively. Findings of this study corroborates with that of Guo ef al., (2019) where late
maturing genotypes produced more pods per plant than early maturing genotypes. The
lower number of pods per plant in Ryokko could be potentially due to less vegetative

Figure 15. Number of pods plant’! of six soybean genotypes as influenced by planting dates

growth prior to entering the reproductive growth stage resulting in pre-mature blooming

due to suboptimal photoperiod condition. Reduced vegetative growth tend to reduce

54

photosynthetic area required for developing pods, seeds, and seed weight and quality
(Board and Hall, 1984). Further, despite being self-pollinating, poor seed setting in
soybeans is caused by abiotic stresses such as excessive temperature, drought stress and
plant competition (Epler and Staggenborg, 2008, Holshouser, 2009). The finding of this
study was concomitant to the observation of Castoldi er al., (2011) wherein soybeans that
produce lesser number of pods have relatively large seeds. Egli and Bruening, (2000) and
Kantolic and Slafer (2001) attributed shorter pod set periods to fewer pods and seeds per
unit area leading to a lower yield. Soybeans tested in this experiment may have a shorter

pod set period particularly in November 2021 resulting to fewer pods plant’.

Green Pod Weight Plant!

The green pod weight plant" was significantly influenced by both genotypes and
planting dates as indicated in the P<0.05 (Figure 14). On average, green pod weight plant”
' was recorded to be at 50.93 g plant’. AGS 374, Manchuria, Ryokko, and Tudela Black
planted in September 2021 and May 2022 produced the heaviest green pod weight plant”!
with an average of 62.75 g, 77.13 g, 42.3 g, and 47.82 g plant’, respectively. In addition,
green pod yield of Tiwala 8 increased significantly by up to 18.38 g plant” only when
plant2ed in May 2022 planting. In the case of Tudela Black, green pod weight plant” was
similarly high on the 3 planting dates excluding those which were planted in November
2021 where there was a 43% reduction in green pod weight plant’'. Consequently,
November 2021 and January 2022 plantings on average gave the lowest green pod weight

plant"' for AGS 374 (40.83 g). Manchuria (51.54 g), Ryokko (28.88 g) and Tiwala 12

sown in November 2021. As per varietal comparison across planting dates, Tiwala 8 and
Manchuria had the highest pod weight reaching up to 78 g and 74 g plant’, respectively.
Meanwhile, Ryokko gave the lowest pod yield plant’! yielding only between 28.8 g to 43
g plant’.

Yield reduction in soybeans when sown beyond the crucial planting date could be
a response to changes in the plant or changes in the plant’s environment or a combination
of both factors. A delay in planting will frequently led to shorter vegetative and

flowering/pod set duration although the seed-fill duration is not consistently shorter (Egli

56

and Bruening, 2000; Bastidas ef al., 2008). Shorter plants with fewer nodes may not
necessarily limit yield given that the crop should produce enough leaf area to maximize

solar radiation interception (Egli, 1993).

Green Pod Yield Hectare"

Based on the planting density utilized in this experiment, there was theoretically
160,000 plants ha’', Interaction among planting dates and genotypes was strongly
influenced pod yield per ha"! based on P>0.05 value (Figure 15). Sowing AGS 374,
Manchruria, Ryokko, and Tiwala 12 in September 2021 and May 2022 consistently
increased yield by up to 35%, 33%, 32% and 36%. Tiwala 8 tend to increase yield (11,940
kg ha’') only when sown in September 2021 followed by those which were sown both
January 2022 (10,076 kg ha’') and May 2022 (10,248 kg ha’'). In the case of Tudela Black,
a significant increase in yield was observed across different planting dates excluding those
which were planted in November 2021 which severely declined yield by up to 42%. As
shown in all planting dates, Manchuria together with Tiwala 8 and Tudela were the highest
yielding genotypes whereas Ryokko and Tiwala 12 were the lowest yielding genotypes.
According to Guo ef al., 2019 later maturing genotypes have more fresh pod yield than
early ones. In addition, late maturing genotypes have more vegetative growth duration and
bloom number, and more photosynthetically active green are which helps to produce more
assimilates for higher pod numbers and growing seeds.

The reduction of in fresh pod yield of vegetable soybean by delayed planting date

might be in part attributable to the shortened duration of seed filling at later planting dates

Figure 15. Green pod yield (kg ha’). of vegetable soybeans as influenced by genotypes and

(Weaver 1991). Shorter duration of vegetative and reproductive stages could result in yield
reduction because of decreased pod number and seed number per unit area (Egli and
Bruening, 2000; Chen and Wiatrak, 2010). This could be explained why November 2021
and January 2022 planting had lower fresh pod yield since the phenological stages had
been shortened which resulted into less vegetative growth resulting to a reduction in the
number of reproductive nodes as observed in AGS 374, Manchuria, Ryokko, and Tiwala
12. Late maturing genotypes Tiwala 8 and Tudela Black had a greater reduction in yield

when planted only in November 2021 where they also experienced a greater decline in

plant height and number of nodes.

Percentage (%) Marketable Pods Plant! (by weight basis)

Marketable pods were measured only to include pods that are either 2- or 3-seeded
pods with no apparent damage brought about by disease causing microorganisms and insect
damage. The marketable pod yield was strongly influenced by the interactions between
cultivars and planting dates (P<0.05) (Figure 16). The mean value of marketable pods
across all soybean genotypes was 78.43%. A very variable response is observed from each
soybean genotypes to different planting dates, hence, no definite pattern can be drawn.
Marketable pod yield plant"' of both AGS 374 and Tiwala 12 was unaffected irrespective
of planting dates having 82.80% and 84.14%, respectively. Interestingly. for the
benchmark variety, Ryokko, planting in May 2022 increased the number of marketable
pods plant'. A lower marketable pod in Ryokko was attributed to a greater number of 1-
seeded pods per plant. In the case of Manchuria, planting in September 2021 improved
marketable pods compared to November 2021 and January 2021 sowing. Tiwala 8 and
Ryokko similarly reduced the number of marketable pods when sown January 2022. Tudela
Black increased the number of marketable pods during the September 2021 and May 2022
sowing dates. Across planting dates, Tiwala 12, has the most stable percent marketable
pods plant’ ranging from 83.12 to 85.14%.

Zhang et al., (2010) proposed that the reduction in marketable yield of vegetable
soybean by 34 to 55 kg ha‘'d"! with a delay in planting was mainly associated to a decrease
in two-seed and three-seed pods. According to Li er al., (2014) the number of two-seeded
pods might be the major yield determinant of vegetable soybean in changing environment

with greater capacity for maintaining more 2-seeded pods may possess an advantage in a

late planting environment. In addition, Kantolic and Slafer (2001) and Calvino ef al.,
(2003) also summarized the reason for a decline in marketable yield especially for late
planted soybean such as shorter season length leading to growth reduction, short days
associated with low light and low temperature leading to slower growth rates and lower
pod set and an abrupt decline on the relative duration of key phenostages because of

reduced photoperiod.

Harvest Index
The harvest index (HI) or economic coefficient refers to the ratio of the economic
yield to the dry-matter accumulation at harvest, which indicates the ability to convert

photosynthetic product into economic product (Liu et al. 2020).

Harvest Index

Harvest index was found to be significantly influenced by genotypes and planting
dates (P<().05) (Figure 17). Harvest index for all soybean genotypes used in the experiment
had a mean value of 45.78. A consistent statistically significant harvest index was observed
on all soybean genotypes (except Manchuria) when sown in November 2021. By contrast,
planting in either September 2021 and May 2022 remarkably reduced harvest index in
Manchuria, Tiwala 12, Tiwala 8, and Tudela Black.

Extensive mutual shading especially among tall genotypes can be observed in May
2022. According to Franklin (2005) shading promotes rapid elongation of stems and
petioles and reduced branches while decreasing the photosynthetic rate, harvest index, and
stem mechanical strength. Lodging was more apparent to tall genotypes such as Manchuria,

Tiwala 8, and Tudela Black also potentially decreasing the harvest index. In addition,

61

greater biomass or vegetative production in soybeans does not translate to a greater harvest
index.

Schapaugh and Wilcox (1980) found that biological yields (aboveground biomass),
vegetative yield (above-ground non-grain biomass), the components of vegetable yield
(straw weight and leaf weight), maturity, and plant height were inversely correlated to the
actual and apparent harvest indices. In addition, the growth habit and the harvest index of
soybeans show no relationships. Board and Maricherla (2008) also showed that inverse
relationships between yield and harvest index was also caused by the inverse relationship
between the total dry matter at R5 stage and node production efficiency. Such finding
confirms that on sowing dates where plant biomass as well as yield is high, there was a
concomitant decline in its harvest index. Comparably lower yields in November 2021 also

translated into higher harvest index and vice versa.

Percentage in 3-, 2-, and 1-Seeded Pods

Previous studies suggested that the proportions of 2 or 3-seeded pods is dependent
on the genetic and environmental factors (Ogles et al., 2016; Tischner et al., 2003). The
percentage 3-, 2-, and l-seeded pods were significantly influenced by the interaction
between planting dates and soybean genotypes at P<0.05 (Figure 18a-c). The mean
percentage for 3-, 2-, and 1-seeded pods were 33.83%, 49.56%, and 15.86%, respectively.
Essentially, all soybean genotypes on average produced more of the 2-seeded pods
(49.56%) followed by 3-seeded pods (33.83%), and being the least produced, the 1-seeded

pods (15.86%). The present study coincides with the findings of Guo et al., (2019) where

2-, and 3-seeded pods were greater compared to 1-seeded pods in all genotypes they tested.
In addition, soybeans generally produced more 2-seeded pods than 3- or 1-seeded pods
with some varietal exceptions.

The proportion of 3-seeded pods in AGS 374, Ryokko and Tiwala 12 was
significantly increased when planted in May 2022 although it is statistically similar with
September 2021 and January 2022 for AGS 374, and Tiwala 12, respectively. All other
soybean genotypes yielded different responses in relation to the production of 3-seeded
pods with no definite pattern. Among genotypes. Tiwala 8 and Tiwala 12 consistently
produced the most numerous 3-seeded pods across all planting dates. except those which
were sown in September 2021 and May 2022, respectively. On the other hand. Ryokko
produced the least number of 3-seeded pods across planting dates. Interestingly. Tudela
Black also produced the least number of pods similar to Ryokko during the 4"" sowing date.

A significant increase in the production of 2-seeded pods was observed in
Manchuria, Tiwala 8, and Tudela when sown in May 2022. Meanwhile, 2-seeded pod
production in Ryokko was consistently unaffected by planting dates. AGS 374 and Tiwala
12 had no definite response pattern unlike other soybean genotypes tested. Among
genotypes tested, Tudela Black produced the most 2-seeded pods throughout all planting
dates followed by AGS 374 particularly in November 2021, and January 2022 plantings.
The least producer of 2-seeded pods was observed in Tiwala 12. Late maturing genotypes
had a higher percentage of 2-seeded pods compared to early maturing genotypes based on
the findings by Guo ef al., (2019) and Ogles ef al., (2016). However, in this study, it may

be noted that Tudela Black being the late maturing genotypes produced the most numerous

64

2-seeded pods, Ryokko being a vegetable soybean with early maturing characteristics also
produced more 2-seeded pods including AGS 374.

As per 1-seeded pods, no standard pattern can be drawn from each variety on
different planting dates. Among different genotypes, Ryokko being the earliest to reach R6
consistently produced the most 1-seeded pods ranging from 30% to 34%. Conversely,
Tiwala 8 produced the least number of 1-seeded pods ranging from 7 — 9%. The findings
of this study coincided with the reports of Duppong and Valenti (2005) wherein the early
maturing cultivar ‘Envy’ produced the most numerous 1-seeded pods which maybe
attractive for growers who are interested with early maturing cultivar. On the other hand,
late maturing cultivars such as ‘IA1010°, ‘IA2062’, and ‘Butterbean’ maybe desirable
cultivars for producers who are interested in greater yield of three-bean pods for fresh
market consumption.

The number of seeds per pod is not known to affect bean flavor and quality (Miles
et al., 2000). Soybeans, despite being self-pollinating, poor seed setting is caused by abiotic
stress such as temperature extremes, drought stress, and plant competition (Houlshouser,
2009). However, it is an important variable to consider for fresh market production, since
many Asian consumers prefer 2-bean and three-bean pods. The results of this study
revealed that most of the soybeans tested were able to produce significant number of 3- or
2-seeded pods plant”. Further, according to Guo et al., (2019) the percentage 1-, 2-, and 3-
seeded pods showed lower heritability (39, 37, and 28%, respectively) suggesting that these

traits were highly influence by environment.

65

Green Pod Dimensions

The size pods in relation to its length, width, thickness was strongly influenced by
planting dates and genotypes (P<0.05) (Figure 19a-c). Pod length, width, and thickness of
soybean genotypes tested measure an average of 46.81 mm, 10.28 mm, and 6.15 mm,
respectively. Longer pod length was observed in AGS 374, Manchuria, Ryokko, and
Tiwala 12 when sown in May 2022. On the other hand, the shortest pod was highly variable
among soybeans in different planting dates. In Tiwala 8 and Tudela Black a slight
difference in pod length was detected among planting dates. Among genotypes. pods of
Ryokko were consistently the most elongated ranging from 51.40 mm to 53.70 mm
whereas Tudela Black has the shortest pod ranging from 38.05 mm to 39.85 mm.

In terms of pod width, AGS 374, Manchuria, Tiwala 8, and Tudela Black produced
the widest pod width during the 2021 plantings. Widest pod width was observed in AGS
374, Tiwala 8, and Tudela Black when sown both in September and November 2021. By
contrast, narrow pods were produced during January and May 2022. An increase in pod
width in Ryokko and Tiwala 12 was detected only in September 2021, and November 2021,
respectively. A decrease in pod width was observed across all genotypes on May 2022
planting, except for Manchuria. Greatest width of pods was observed in Ryokko ranging
from 12.84 mm to 14.26 mm whereas the shortest was that of Tudela Black which had 8.26
mm to 8.98 mm.

In relation to pod thickness, a highly variable and no definite response was observed
each planting dates across different soybean genotypes. Manchuria, Tiwala 8, and Tudela

Black produced comparably thicker pods when sown in November 2021. Pod thickness of

AGS 374 and Ryokko was however unaffected by different planting dates. Thicker pods
in general were produced by Ryokko (8.10 mm to 8.28 mm) in all planting dates tested
whereas thinner pods were produced by Tudela Black (4.73 mm to 5.27 mm) Ryokko,
being utilized as edamame had the greatest overall size of pods followed by AGS 374 and
Tiwala 12 whereas Tudela Black had overall the smallest pod size. In this study, soybeans
that are late maturing have smaller pods compared to early maturing ones. Pod dimensions
(pod length, pod width, and pod thickness) is an important vegetable soybean
characteristics. Pod length including hundred pod weight define vegetable soybean
genotypes (Mehbratu and Devine, 2008). In this study, these important pod traits were
significantly modified both by genotypic difference and environmental factors contained
within a particular sowing date. Frank and Fehr (1981) showed that pods tend to achieve
maximum length and width ranging from 15-20 days after pollination, although, pod
dimensions can still be improved given an adequate amount of rainfall that overlaps the
pod development stage and seed filling stage. In addition, studies of Al-Tawaha (2010)
found that seeds originated from the lower part of a soybean plant leads to the production
of greater pod length and width compared to those which developed on the upper plant

parts.

Seed Size

thickness among soybeans were 11.60 mm and 5.02 mm, respectively. Seed length in
Manchuria, Tiwala 12, and Tudela Black were apparently shorter when grown in
September 2021. Ryokko only experience a reduction in seed length when sown in January
2022. On the other hand, seed length of AGS 374 was improved during the fourth planting.

Irrespective of planting dates. Tiwala 8 showed no difference in seed length. In relation to

69

seed thickness, no standard pattern can be drawn between planting dates at each genotypes
owing to the fact of its highly variable response.

Following the data on pod size, larger seed size was noted in Ryokko (13.71 mm to
14.57 mm in length; 6.58 mm to 7.06 mm in thickness) followed either AGS 374 or Tiwala
12. On the other hand, seeds of smaller size were found in Tudela Black with 9.02 mm to
9.35 mm in length and 3.86 mm to 4.07 mm in thickness.

Seed size is a function of the rate of seed growth and the length of time it takes the
seed to undergo full seed development occupying the pod cavity and attain the R6 stage
(Van Roekel ef al., 2015). Additionally. seed growth is highly associated to the seed
dimensions. Berger-Doyle ef al., (2014) reported that seed size is a highly heritable trait
which means that seed size is mainly genetically determined. In this study however, seed
size was highly influenced both by genotypic and sowing dates. LeRoy er al., (1991) also
reported a significant genetic by environment interaction effect on the resulting seed size
of soybeans.

A growing seed expresses its need for photosynthates relative to its size. In this
study, large-seeded genotypes such as Ryokko, Tiwala 12, and AGS 374 supposedly
displayed more effective rates of seed growth and assimilates required in order to prevent
the seeds from potential abortion due to high number of floral organs. It is important to
note that large-seeded genotypes can nevertheless produce the greatest final total seed
weight in comparison to smaller-seeded genotypes even when they are subjected to
equivalent photosynthetic rates and reproductive partitioning. Egli and Bruening (2000)

hypothesized that late planting dates caused a drop in reproductive nodes and smaller pods.

70

With enough leaf area for light absorption, fewer seeds of a substantially larger size were

generated given that the length of the seed filling stage was neither altered nor shortened.

100-Fresh and Dry Pod Weight

The 100-fresh and dry (Figure 21 a-b) weight of pods was strongly influenced by
planting dates and genotypes. On average, the weight of 100-fresh and dry pods was at
131.67 g and 40.34 g, respectively. 100-fresh pod weight of both Manchuria and Tiwala 8
was observed to be unaffected by planting dates. Planting AGS 374 in May 2022 has
heavier fresh pod weight compared to those planted in January 2022. For Ryokko, sowing
both in November 2021 and May 2022 improved 100-fresh weight compared to the rest of
the sowing dates. Also. in Tiwala 12, May 2022 had the greatest 100-fresh pod weight
among planting dates. Conversely, Tudela Black had lighter 100-fresh pod weight in May
2022 compared to other sowing dates. Among genotypes, Ryokko consistently had the
greatest 100-fresh pod weight across planting dates ranging from 195 g to 221.5 g followed
by AGS 374 weighing 137.25 g to 152.25 g.. On the other hand, Tudela Black had lighter
100-fresh pod weight throughout planting dates weighing 63.25 g to 80.50 g followed by
Tiwala 8 weight 99.5 g to 102.75 g.

In terms of dry pod weight, November 2021 generally yielded higher 100-dry pod
weight across genotypes although there might be a slight statistical similarity with other

planting dates. The lowest 100-dry pod weight was observed in September 2021 especially

100-dry pods with heavier weights ranging from 49.5 g to 57.75 g whereas, Tudela Black

had the lightest 100-dry pods at 22.5 g to 28.5 g.

72

100-Fresh and Dry Seed Weight

Significant interaction between genotypes and planting dates was detected at
P<0.05 in terms of 100-fresh and dry (Figure 22a-b) seed weight. On average, the weight
of 100-fresh and dry pods was at 131.67 g and 40.34 g. The 100-fresh seed weight of AGS
374, Manchuria, Tiwala 8, and Tudela Black was seemed to be unaltered by planting dates.
However, for Ryokko and Tiwala 12, there was an observed reduction in 100-fresh seed
weight during the 3" and 1* planting, respectively. As per varietal difference, Ryokko
produced bigger seeds with heavier mass at 50.5 g to 58.5 g followed by either AGS 374
or Tiwala 12. On the contrary, either Tudela Black with small seeds have the lowest 100-
fresh seed weight ranging from 14.75 g to 17.25 g.

For 100-dry seeds, each genotypes behaved differently under different sowing
dates. It can be noted that soybeans grown in September 2021 had lesser dry matter
comparable to other planting dates although there were slight similarities. Ryokko
produced seeds of higher dry matter meanwhile Tudela Black can be considered as having
the lowest 100-dry seed weight.

The mass of seed is more stable within a particular species and thus less correlated
with seed yield variation (Monzon et al., 2021). Green seed weight is one of the most
important characteristics for commercial edamame production (Konovsky ef al., 1994) and
an important yield determinant and quality parameter that dictates consumer acceptability
(Mbuvi and Litchfield, 1995). In general, seed quality characteristics of vegetable soybeans

attain their peak levels when the seed size is also at its maximum (Rao ef al., 2002). Ina

study by Zhang er al., (2010) they found that fresh seed weight on late planted soybeans
did not decrease but rather increased by 5-35%. They assumed that there existed a

compensatory mechanism whereby a decline in seed number also resulted in an increase in

seed fresh weight.

74

Rao ef al., (2002) also showed that Tambagura vegetable soybean although may
have produced fewer seeds per pod, it had higher pod yield because of heavier seeds. On
the other hand, variety Hutcheson had a greater number of pods and seeds per pod, but its
pod yield was not as high as many other genotypes because of smaller seeds. Studies by
Guo ef al., (2019) indicate that seed weight is a major contributing factor for yield. A rise
in seed weight is a major factor in overall yield increases in edamame as it is with other

crops species such as wheat and corn.

Seed Quality

Seeds of soybean is a major source of protein. oil, carbohydrates, isoflavones, and
minerals for human and animal nutrition (Bellaloui ef a/., 2011). Planting date modify the
seed composition by changing the oil, protein, and other important soybean composition

(Hu and Wiatrak, 2012).

Seed Moisture Content

There was no significant interaction between planting dates and genotypes on seed
moisture content was detected at P<0.05 (Figure 23). However, varietal factor has a
significant effect on the moisture content of soybeans under different sowing dates. On
average, soybeans had 64.44% moisture content during the R6 stage of development.
Higher seed moisture content was found in large-seeded vegetable soybean variety Ryokko

(72.43%) followed by AGS 374 (67.65%) and Tiwala 12 having (66.62%). The least seed

Figure 23. Seed moisture content of different soybean genotypes across planting dates

moisture content was observed in Tudela Black (57.96%) which is comparable to
Manchuria (60.52%). It can be drawn in this study, that large-seeded genotypes store more
moisture than those soybeans with smaller seeds.

In a study by Kumar et al., (2011) on the evaluation of compositional traits of
soybeans, they found seed moisture content ranging from 65.74 to 76 with a mean value of
70.8g/100g seeds. Large-seeded genotypes in this study conforms to the reported values
but not with those genotypes having lower moisture content as observed in Manchuria,
Tiwala 8 and Tudela Black. In another study by Yu ef al., (2021), moisture content of fresh
beans was in the range of 63.10-73.22%. Agyenim-Boateng ef al., (2023) also found 62.19
to 72.90% seed moisture content with a mean value of 66.54%. Moisture content of beans
reduces gradually during bean development; hence, harvest time is a significant factor
which determines the moisture content of harvested green beans (Xu et al., 2016). The

optimal harvest period of soybeans intended for vegetable consumption is when bean have

76

occupied 80-90% of the pod cavity and the pods are still green and immature. Optimal
quality upon harvest is ensured when edamame is harvested at a right timing. Additionally,
moisture content influences the organoleptic value that is also an important determiner of

maturity and marketability of vegetable soybeans (Boateng ef al., 2023).

Oil Content

Interaction effects between genotypes and planting date significantly influenced the
oil content of green soybean seeds at P<0.05 (Figure 24). Oil content of soybeans has a
mean value of 201.41 mg g’'. In general, soybeans sown in May 2022 had reduction oil
content across genotypes, except with Tudela Black which is statistically similar to those
planted in January 2022. Planting Ryokko and Tiwala 8 both in September and November
2021 had the remarkable increase in oil content followed by those sown in January 2022.
Oil content of Manchuria was not affected by all other planting dates. Sowing AGS 374
and Tiwala 12 November 2021 sowing significantly increased the oil content of seeds.
Meanwhile, for Manchuria, similar response was observed across all other planting dates.

The highest oil content was detected in Tiwala 12 (239.61 g mg”') when sown on
November 2021 while the lowest was recorded in Ryokko (158.71 g mg”) planted in May
2022.

Unlike grain soybeans with high oil content intended for vegetable oil and soy-
diesel, a lower oil content is usually preferred for soy food products including edamame
(Zhang et al., 2017). The combination of lower oil content and relatively higher protein

content makes them desirable to health-conscious people which are after low fat, and high

On the other hand, Carson ef al., (2011) had reported oil content values between 140 and

ranged from 158 g kg" to 239 g kg"! which is slightly lower and higher to the reported
values of previous studies.

According to Rotundo and Westgate (2009), a warmer temperature during seed
filling stage that commences about 2 weeks after flowering is associated to a decreased
lipid content. This conforms to the observation in this study in which 4" planting had higher

mean temperature (26°C) than the rest of the planting date that resulted to the decrease in

78

oil content of all soybeans tested. Contrast to this finding, Gibson, and Mullen (1996)
reported that oil content increases following an increase in temperature by up to 28°C,
above which the oil content began to decline. High temperature is known to decrease seed
filling duration which may have contributed to a reduction in oil and protein content

(Chimenti et al., 2001).

Protein Content

The amount of protein was significantly affected by the interaction between
planting dates and genotypes (P<0.05) (Figure 25). On average soybean seeds contain an
average of 386.72 mg g’! and values ranging from 281.10 to 447.26 mg g". Planting in
May 2022 induced a decrease in the amount of protein in AGS 374, Manchuria, and
Ryokko. Tiwala 12 on the other hand, produced significantly higher total protein content
when planted in November 2021 that was comparable to those sown in May 2022. Tiwala
8 increased protein content when planted in January 2022 while the lowest amount was
recorded in September 2022. Tudela Black produced significant amount of protein across
planting dates except for those sown in November 2021. The results of the protein
concentration in soybeans were apparently variable at each planting dates. However, the
highest protein content (447.26 mg g’') was observed in Tiwala 8 which was grown in
January while the lowest protein (281.10 mg g"') was observed in Tudela Black planted
November 2021.

Protein is one of the most important nutritional components in vegetable soybeans.

The high-quality protein in edamame makes it a good alternative diet for vegans and

vegetarians, thus, higher amount of protein is desirable (Zeipina ey al., 2017). According
to Saldivar ef al., (2011) the most acceptable amount of protein in vegetable soybean
should be more than 45% with relatively low amount of oil of up to 18%. In a study by
Rao ef al., (2002) reported the amount of protein in their study between 33% to 39%. Li et
al., (2012) on the other hand reported higher amount of protein ranging from 379-478 mg
g’'. Yang ef al., (2021) also reported almost similar protein values which ranged from 38.77
to 45.57% based on dry mass. The amount protein in soybeans could be affected by
increasing day temperatures higher than 30°C. Increased protein content under higher
temperatures was also reported by Dornbos & Mullen, (1992). Contrast to this, AGS 374,
Manchuria, Ryokko, and Tiwala 12 experienced a decline in protein during May 2022
planting despite having higher growth temperature. In addition, Kumar et al., (2006) found

that shortened duration from flowering to maturity may lead to a reduction of protein

80

accumulation. On the other hand, Bellaloui ef a/., (2011) suggested that lower temperature

during seed filling may also contribute to a higher protein content.

Total Sugar Content

The sugar content of soybeans harvested at R6 stage was significantly affected by
the interaction of planting dates and genotypes at P<0.05 (Figure 26). Total sugar content
on average was at 96.21 mg g”'. Total sugar was highly variable among soybeans at each
planting date. Total sugar content of soybeans planted in September 2021 was significantly
reduced for all genotypes tested except for Tiwala 8. The sugar content in Tiwala 8 was
consistently high across planting dates (91.73 to 101 mg g"') except for those planted in
May 2022 which only contained 68.37 g mg"!. For Ryokko, there was an increasing amount
of total sugar content from PD1 to PD4. Total sugar content of Ryokko was the lowest in
PD1 (50.16 mg g”') while the highest was measure during PD4 (143.55 mg g'). Manchuria
has an increase total sugar during PD2 and PD3 followed by PD4. AGS 374 behave
differently since it only increased its total sugar during January 2022 planting.

Across planting dates, there was no consistent variety which had either higher or
lower total sugar content due to their high variability. Although, the highest total sugar
value was reported in Ryokko planted during May 2022 with 143.55 mg g”' while the
lowest was also in the same variety with 50.16 mg g”'.

Previous studies highlighted the significance of sugar levels in fresh vegetable
soybean seeds because the total soluble sugar affects the organoleptic properties of

edamame and dictates consumer acceptability (Sugitomo ef al., 2010) and there is a

significant relationship between taste score and sugar content (Shanmugasundaram ef
al.,2001; Kumar es al, 2011). The soluble sugar content of soybeans include
monosaccharides (fructose and glucose), disaccharides (sucrose), and oligosaccharides
(raffinose and stachyose) (Xu ef al., 2016). In a study by Li er al., (2012) they reported that
sucrose content accounted for 71.7% of the TSS on average which clearly suggests that
sucrose content constitutes the majority of TSS in fresh seed of vegetable soybean and a
considerable factor that influences the taste of vegetable soybeans. Yu ef al., (2022)
demonstrated that sugars together with starch, alanine, and glycine peaked at R6 and
declined thereafter. Sucrose concentration usually decreases slowly from R6 to late R7
and R8 stages (Xu ef al., 2016). A decrease in sucrose also increases sugars that is
associated to flatulence and stomach discomfort (stachyose and raffinose). This also

happens during the later stage of seed development.

Correlation Analysis

Pearson correlation analysis between selected phenological, morpho-physiological
traits, and yield components was performed on each planting dates (Table 3). Fresh pod
yield (kg ha’') was positively correlated with the number of days to R6, plant height at R6,
number of nodes, and number of pods across all four planting dates (Table 3). The results
of the correlation analysis suggests that fresh pod yield of vegetable soybeans can benefit
from longer phenological period resulting in taller plants with more nodes. Notably, PD3
showed a strong positive relationship (r = 83 — 88) among the correlated parameters. On
the other hand, fresh pod yield was negatively correlated with the frequency of 1-seeded
pods, and 100-fresh pod and seed weight. This indicates that high yielding soybean
genotypes also produces less 1-seeded pods although they will produce smaller pods and

seeds.

The number of days to R6 was positively associated to an increase in plant height
at R6 containing more nodes which translated in greater number of pods and fresh pod
yield. Masoudi et al., (2009) found a significant positive relationship between growing
stages such as number of days to flowering and days to complete maturity and plant height.
In a study by Zhang et al., (2015) they also found that plant height and number of nodes
are highly correlated with agronomic traits of soybeans such as days to flowering (DF) and
days to maturity (DM). Such correlation is thought to be mainly adaptive traits as a

response to photoperiodic condition which permits different soybean cultivar to thrive to

limited geographic regions. Pedersen and Lauer (2004) also found that plant height and
number of nodes was influenced by the postponed development of reproductive stages.
The frequency of 3-seeded pods was positively correlated to the number of days to
R6, plant height at R6, and number of nodes in all planting dates except for PD4.
Interestingly, the number of 3-seeded pods was positively correlated to the fresh pod yield
but only in PD1. Since 3-seeded pods are considered marketable, extending the number of
days to harvest which results into taller plants with numerous nodes also increases its
frequency among pods produced by vegetable soybeans. By contrast, the production of 3-
seeded pods was negatively correlated with both 2- and I-seeded pods. In addition. it was
also shown that 3-seeded pods negatively correlated with 100-fresh pod and seed weight
on all planting dates with PD4 as an exception. A higher frequency of 3- and 2-seeded pods
is advantageous to vegetable soybean producers since they fall under the marketable pod
category. The findings of this study corroborate with the reports of Nishioka and Okumura
(2008) where they found a positive correlation between the duration of R1 to R6, the
number of pods, and the frequency of 3-seeded pods to the total number of pods.
Contrarily, Guo ef al., (2019) observed that early maturing genotypes had a higher

percentage of 3-seeded pods than late maturing genotypes.

The frequency of 2-seeded pods was only positively correlated with plant height at
R6 and number of pods only on PD4. On the other hand, the percent 2-seeded pods had a
strong negative correlation with an r value ranging from -0.75 to -0.86 with 3-seeded pods.

Despite such relationship, it will less likely reduce the marketability of pods since both of

85

3- and 2-seeded pods are marketable. Moreover, harvest index and percent 2-seeded pod

also showed a negative moderate (r = 0.51) relationship only on PD3.

The consistent strong positive relationship (r = 0.73 — 0.90) across planting dates
was observed between 1|-seed pods and 100-fresh pod and seed weight. This indicates that
longer to mature vegetable soybeans having numerous pods also produces smaller pods
and seeds. Pod and seed size are important vegetable soybean characteristics; hence,
breeders should look for genotypes with higher pod and seed size with less occurrence of
1-seeded pods. This relationship was also in agreement to the study of Castoldi er al.,
(2011) and Guo er al., (2019) wherein 100-green seed weight showed a strong positive
correlation with l-seeded pods but was not correlated with 2- and 3-seeded pods.
Compensatory mechanisms which result into a negative relationship between individual
seed weight and seed number (Evans, 1996) account for the stability of seed weight
commonly reported for late sown soybean (Egli and Bruening, 2001).

The 100-fresh pod and seed weight was consistently negatively correlated with the
number of days to R6, plant height at R6, number of nodes, and number of pods in all
planting dates. In this case, soybean genotypes with longer days to maturity generally have
smaller pods and seeds. Zhang ef al., (2010) observed that delaying planting which is
characterized by shorter growth duration decrease pod number but increased fresh weight

indicates a compensatory mechanism.

Moreover, a negative correlation was demonstrated by harvest index and plant

height at R6, and number of pods in all planting dates. In addition, the number of days to

86

R6 was also negatively correlated with harvest index only apparently during PD1 and PD4.
Planting vegetable soybeans in high yielding conditions may benefit from an increase in
vegetative biomass however, the economic yield may be affected as represented by a lower

harvest index.

Pearson correlation analysis was also performed between selected phenological,
morpho-physiological traits and yield components on different vegetable soybean
genotypes (Table 4). Fresh pod yield (kg ha™') was positively correlated with plant height
at R6 and the number of pods consistent across soybean genotypes. In addition, fresh pod
yield was positively correlated with the number of nodes only on AGS 374, Manchuria,
Tiwala 12, and Tudela Black. A positive correlation was also detected in Ryokko and
Tiwala 8 although not significant. Fresh pod yield and days to R6 had a significant positive
relationship only with Manchuria and Tudela Black. On the other hand, Ryokko
demonstrated a significant negative correlation with fresh pod yield and the number of days
to R6 suggesting that an extended phenological period could decrease fresh pod yield in
Ryokko while for Tudela Black and Manchuria, extension of days to harvest could result

into higher fresh pod yield.

A highly variable correlation was obtained between the occurrence of 3-seeded pod
in different vegetable soybean genotypes with other tested parameters. A positive
correlation between 3-seeded pods with plant height at R6, number of nodes, number of
pods and fresh-pod yield was observed in AGS 374. On the other hand, Tudela Black

obtained a significant negative correlation between 3-seeded pods with days to R6, plant

also had negatively correlated with the percent 3-seeded pods with days to R6, plant height
at R6, and number of nodes. Moreover, across these soybean genotypes (except for
Ryokko), 3-seeded pods was negatively correlated with the occurrence of 2-seeded pods.
Remarkably, Tiwala 8 posted a perfect negative relationship (r = -1.00) between 3-, and 2-
seeded pods, followed by Tudela (r = -0.96) and Manchuria (r = -0.91). Irrespective of
planting dates and soybean genotypes, the presence of 3-seeded pods also negatively

impacts the production of 2-seeded pods.

The correlation analysis between the frequency of 2-seeded pods with other
parameters also shows high variability among soybean genotypes tested. The occurrence

of 2-seeded pods was positively associated with days to R6, plant height at R6, number of

89

nodes and number of pods in Manchuria, Tiwala 8, and Tudela Black. These varieties are
known to be late-maturing with taller stature and more nodes which is also a major

advantage in terms of producing marketable 2-seeded pods.

For 1-seeded pods, a negative correlation was observed with plant height at R6,
number of nodes, number of pods, and fresh pod yield specifically in AGS 374 indicating
that taller plants with more nodes reduces the frequency of 1-seeded pods. Ryokko and
Tudela Black could also benefit from a decrease in the frequency of 1-seeded pods by
increasing plant height. Moreover, increasing pod yield in AGS 374 and Tudela Black
could reduce the frequency of 1-seeded pods which also increases the percentage of

marketable green pods.

Harvest index of different soybean genotypes consistently showed a significant
negative relationship with plant height at R6, number of pods, number of nodes, and fresh
pod yield although except for Ryokko on the two latter parameters. Regardless of planting
dates and genotypes, a reduction in harvest index can be readily attributable to increase in
plant height with more pods. The result of this study is congruent to the observation by
Zandonadi et al., (2010) that shorter plants produced a higher harvest efficiency compared
to taller plants. In another study by Jin e¢ al., (2010) they found also a significant negative
relationship between plant height and harvest index with an r = -0.650. Moreover, harvest
index revealed a significant positive and negative relationship with 3-seeded and 2-seeded

pods, respectively for late maturing genotypes Manchuria, Tiwala 8, and Tudela Black.

90

High variability of correlation was observed between 100-fresh pod and seed
weight. 100-fresh pod weight in AGS 374 had a moderate positive correlation with plant
height, number of nodes, fresh pod yield and frequency of 3 seeded pods. On other hand,
Tudela Black’s 100-fresh pod weight demonstrated a negative correlation with days to R6
and plant height at R6 indicating which would be disadvantageous as bigger pods with
seeds are more preferred by consumers. Moreover, harvest index and frequency of 3-

seeded pods in Tudela Black is positively correlated with 100-fresh pod weight.

Pearson correlation analysis among selected phenological traits, and seed and
quality traits among different planting dates are presented in Table 5. The number of days
to R6 showed a negative relationship with seed size, 100-fresh seed weight, and seed
moisture content consistent among planting dates indicating that a delayed maturity could
result into smaller seed size and weight. On the other hand, seed size, 100-fresh seed

weight, and seed moisture content are positively correlated with one another.

Seed composition parameters (oil content, total protein, and total sugars) exhibited
a highly variable correlation result. Oil content among different planting dates shown non-
significant relationships with other parameters subjected to correlation analysis. Protein
content in PD2 was positively associated with seed size, 100-fresh seed weight, and seed
moisture content. On the other hand, protein content was negatively correlated with the
seed thickness and 100-fresh seed weight. Interestingly, during PD1 and PD2, protein

content had a moderate positive relationship with total sugar content.

During PD4, total sugars was positively correlated with seed size, 100-fresh seed
weight, and seed moisture content. In addition, there was also a positive association
between total sugars and oil content specifically in PD3. By contrast in PD2, total sugars
were negatively correlated with seed thickness and seed moisture content. The results of
this correlation analysis suggests that seed quality traits can be easily modified by planting
dates which will specifically favor an increase in the amount of protein and sugar with a

minimal amount of oil.

Pearson correlation analysis among selected phenological traits, and seed and
quality traits among different soybean genotypes are presented in Table 6. Extremely
variable with few significant correlation responses were detected among all soybean
genotypes used in the study. Seed size in AGS 374 and Tiwala 12 can be improved by
increasing the number of days to R6 as shown in their positive relationship the strongest
being with Tiwala 12 (r = 0.85-0.86). Consequently, seed size of Ryokko had a negative

relationship with the number of days to R6.

The seed moisture content showed either positive or negative non-significant
relationship especially with seed quality traits across soybean genotypes. Protein content
revealed a positive relationship with oil content in genotypes AGS 374, Manchuria and
Ryokko. Consequently, sugar content in Ryokko negatively correlated with both oil content
and total protein content. Meanwhile in Tiwala 8, total sugar content positively correlated

with oil content.

CHAPTER V

SUMMARY CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
Summary

The effect of four planting dates (September 2021, November 2021, January 2022,
and May 2022) and soybean genotypes (AGS 374, Manchuria, Ryokko, Tiwala 8, Tiwala
12, and Tudela Black) were studied to evaluate the phenology, morpho-physiology, yield,
and quality of vegetable soybeans. The field experiment was conducted under Bukidnon
conditions which was laid in a Randomized Complete Block Design replicated four times.
Soybeans were harvested during R6 (full seed stage). Data gathered was processed to
generate analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test significance and means were compared
using LSD at P<0.05. To test significant relationships among variables obtained, Pearson
correlation was used. Further, climatological data (mean monthly temperature, humidity,

rainfall) was obtained to relate soybean responses between planting dates.

Results revealed significant interaction effects between planting dates and different
soybean genotypes (P<0.05) among all parameters tested except for the seed moisture
content. Planting in May 2022 significantly extended the number of days to flowering (R1)
and the number of days to full-seed stage (R6) across all genotypes except for Ryokko. In
a similar manner, extending R1 and R6 led to an increase in the accumulation of GDD.

Climatic conditions in May 2022 were characterized by higher growth temperature, higher

96

precipitation, and longer daylength. Conversely, planting in November 2021, greatly
accelerated R6 among all soybean genotypes with Ryokko as an exception. Growing
conditions in November 2021 was characterized by lower precipitation especially during
the reproductive stages among soybean genotypes with a concomitant shortened daylength

conditions.

With regard to morpho-physiology, planting in May 2022, significantly increased
plant height among soybean genotypes during R1 and R6. An increase in plant height also
resulted to an increase in the number of nodes plant’ although it yielded similar statistical
results when planted in September 2021 for genotypes Manchuria, Tiwala 12, and Tudela
Black. Irrespective of planting dates and height differences, the number of nodes in Ryokko

remained stable.

In terms of yield and yield components, fresh pod yield ha”! was increased when
planted both in September 2021 and May 2002 for genotypes AGS 374, Manchuria,
Ryokko, and Tiwala 12 while planting in November 2021 and January 2022 resulted in
significant yield reductions. Subsequently, yield of Tiwala 8 was enhanced only when
planted on September 2021. Moreover, similar yield was obtained from Tudela Black

across all planting dates except for the November 2021 plantings.

The ratio between biological yield and economic yield as depicted in harvest index
revealed an opposite response to the fresh pod yield of vegetable soybeans. Under high

yielding conditions such as in September 2021 and May 2022, harvest index also tended to

97

decrease. This is due to competition among other possible sinks (leaves, stems, roots) with

the economic yield (pods).

As to the occurrence of 3-, 2-, and 1-seeded pods, soybean genotypes produced
more 2-seeded pods (49.56%) followed by 3-seeded pods (33.83%) and the least being 1-
seeded pods (15.86%). However, it can be observed that 1-seeded pods were more frequent
in the true vegetable soybean genotype (Ryokko). In relation to fresh pod and seed size and
weight, early maturing genotype like Ryokko had the greatest fresh pod and seed size and

weight while Tudela Black with late maturing characteristics have smaller pods and seeds.

The seed moisture content during R6 stage ranged from 66 — 76%. Interestingly,
Ryokko with larger seeds also store more moisture than small-seeded genotypes (Tudela
Black). The amount of moisture in seeds is an important quality parameter which affects
marketability and can also affect nutritional quality of soybeans. The oil content of
soybeans showed a general decline in May 2022 across all soybean genotypes. In the case
of protein and total sugar, their concentration among vegetable soybeans was highly

variable across genotypes x planting dates.

Results of Pearson correlation analysis revealed that fresh pod yield of vegetable
soybeans is determined by plant height at R6 and number of pods consistent across planting
dates and genotypes. On the other hand, harvest index was also consistently negatively

correlated with plant height, number of nodes, and number of pods.

98
Conclusion

Results of this experiment revealed that both planting dates and genotypes
significantly alter the phenology, morpho-physiology, yield, and quality of vegetable
soybeans. Optimum yield of vegetable soybeans can be achieved when planted starting
from May to September. In this planting months vegetable soybeans can benefit from
higher growth temperature, abundance of rainfall, and longer daylengths favoring an
increase in the overall morpho-physiological parameters thereby increasing fresh pod yield
and marketable pod yield. In the case of seed quality, oil content was significantly reduced
across genotypes in May 2022 planted vegetable soybeans. Additionally, protein and total
sugar content was highly variable across genotypes and planting dates. The major
determinants of fresh pod yield in vegetable soybeans across genotypes and planting dates
were plant height at R6 and number of pods plant”! as indicated in the Pearson correlation
analysis. However, an increase in plant height at R6"'~ and number of pods could indicate

a reduction in harvest index among vegetable soybeans.

Recommendations

A long-term study on the effects of planting dates should be conducted to identify
conclusively the best time to plant soybeans intended for vegetable consumption. This is
also important for seed quality since seed quality can be significantly altered by planting
dates on top of genotypic variations. Screening more locally-available grain soybeans

particularly with large pods can be studied under specific conditions.
