ABSTRACT  
The relationship between work -life balance and job satisfaction remains  a critical area of inquiry in 
organizational research. This study aims to identify the relationship between work -life balance and job 
satisfaction among Malaysian nurses. In order to achieve the objectives of this research, a study was conducted 
in a priv ate hospital in southern Malaysia with a total of 56 respondents. This study used a quantitative 
research design, a questionnaire to collect data, and a non -probability sampling technique. To measure the 
level of work -life balance, a questionnaire of 10 it ems was conducted, while, for the level of job satisfaction, 
the Individual Job Satisfaction Questionnaire was used. The data was then analyzed using the Statistical 
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27. The findings revealed a high level of work -life balance and a 
moderate level of job satisfaction among the respondents. In addition, a weak positive correlation exists 
between work -life balance and job satisfaction. This study's limitation, such as the relationship between work -
life balance and job  satisfaction, urges for a recommendation for future research that it should be interpreted 
cautiously due to methodological constraints including its cross -sectional design, reliance on self -reported 
measures, limited sample size (N=56), questionable repr esentativeness, and analytical approach that did not 
control for potential confounding variables or explore subgroup differences.

INTRODUCTION  
Work -life balance (WLB) is defined as a state of equilibrium where individuals manage professional 
responsibilities and personal pursuits without overpowering the other (Dhas, 2015). According to Mah arani 
and Haeha (2024), WLB refers to being aware of the different demands on time and energy, having the ability 
to allocate time and energy, and knowing what values need to be translated in making choices. WLB is a broad 
concept, including the right priority between work, ambitions, life, health, fun, leisure time, family 
development, and spirituality.  
At the individual level, WLB means combining work with other aspects of human life such as home, family, 
health, social activities and personal interests. From this perspective, WLB provides psychological well -being, 
self-worth, satisfaction levels, and overall harmony in an individual's life. Individuals who balance work and 
personal life are happier, healthier, and more creative. They also fulfil their desire for achievement and 
satisfaction in life. Arnott (20 19) adds that an individual will only successfully deal with three areas of life 
simultaneously, namely in the family, at work, and in the local community, if he/she is provided with the 
appropriate psychological development and balance. However, the balan ce point is not the same for all 
individuals. The coordination of professional and non -professional life is possible if family and colleagues 
support the individual.  
At the organizational level, WLB means a suitable and conducive management system and pers onnel policy to

 maintain a WLB for employees. It is also a source of solutions for organizations aiming to improve work -life 
quality. It means more development opportunities and increases in productivity and employee innovation. The 
most common instruments  employers offer to help employees maintain a WLB are flexible working time, 
leave and allowances, and bonuses.  
Meanwhile, job satisfaction refers to the extent to which an employee is self -motivated and satisfied in his/her 
job. It occurs when employees f eel they have a stable job, room to develop their career, and a good mix 
between work and personal life. That means they feel pleasant at work because the work meets their standards.  
Based on previous studies (Butler et al., 2009; Duffield et al., 2010), i t is important to address how nurses' 
work environment, particularly scheduling flexibility and WLB, will affect job satisfaction. There is limited 
research in understanding and documenting nurses' job satisfaction and what can help improve it. It is vital  to 
explore the potential impact of WLB on nurses' job satisfaction because there is a possible decline in the 
number of people joining such a profession. As employers and organizations understand what impacts job 
satisfaction, they may better understand i f specific changes are needed to be implemented to retain their staff 
and improve the quality of their service.  
RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  
The study aims to achieve the following objective s: 
1. To identify the level of WLB among nurses at a private hospital in Southern Malaysia.  
2. To examine the level of job satisfaction among nurses at a private hospital in Southern Malaysia.  
3. To identify the relationship between WLB and job satisfaction among nurses at a private hospital in 
Southern Malaysi a. 
LITERATURE  REVIEW  
WLB has emerged as a critical determinant of employee well -being, organizational performance, and societal 
health, with research indicating an effective equilibrium between professional responsibilities and personal 
pursuits. At the in dividual employee level, it leads to improved physical and mental health  (Aliasah et al., 
2020; Chakrabarty et al., 2020) , enhanced job productivity and performance  (Dousin et al., 2019; Krishnan & 
Loon , 2018) , increased job satisfaction  (Fidhdho & Larrasaty, 2024; Abdirahman et al., 2018) , and developed 
spirituality and religiosity  (Hashim & Fakhruddin, 2025; Aziz et al., 2021) . On the other hand, at the 
organizational level, it increases employee retention  (Sindhuja & Subramanian, 2020; Ambrose et al., 2020) , 
reduces cost  (Aziz et al., 2023; Rodríguez -Sánchez et al. , 2020) , and elevates organizational growth  (Tkalych 
et al., 2020) . 
Recent literature highlights the importance of WLB among nurses, a profession characterized by high stress 
and demandin g responsibilities. Initially, WLB was a significant challenge for nurses, and various factors 
influenced it. Job demands, including high workloads, long hours, and psychological pressures, contribute to 
work -life imbalance (Ng et al., 2017; Son & Jung, 20 19). In contrast, a study in Padang, Indonesia reported 
high levels of WLB among female nurses, indicating their ability to effectively manage time between work and 
personal life (Luthfia et al., 202 1). 
Additionally , studies on understanding and improving job satisfaction among nurses are vital to enhancing 
organizational performance and patient care. Research on job satisfaction among nurses has shown varying 
levels, from low to moderate (Khunou & Davhana -Maselesele, 2016; Haile et al., 2017). Work environ ment, 
spiritual factors, and motivation significantly impact nurses' job satisfaction, with high satisfaction leading to 
improved patient care quality and reduced burnout (Yanriatuti et al., 2019). In critical care settings, factors 
such as shift patterns,  autonomy, staffing resources, and teamwork positively affect job satisfaction, while job 
stress and emotional exhaustion negatively impact it (Dilig -Ruiz et al., 2018).  
Further, r ecent studies have explored the relationship between WLB and nurse job satisfaction. Although not

 always significantly positive, WLB has been found to influence job satisfaction. A positive correlation between 
quality of work -life and job satisfaction has been observed, with factors such as professional status and work 
context playing important roles (Dargahpour et al., 2022; Morsy & Sabra, 2015). WLB has also been linked to 
nurse retention, with job satisfaction partially mediating this relationship (Aamir  et al., 2016). However, 
studies indicate that only a small percentage of nurses report high levels of WLB and person -job fit (Badran & 
Khalaaf, 202 2). These findings suggest that healthcare organizations should consider implementing policies to 
improve WL B and job satisfaction to enhance nurse retention and overall job performance.  
METHODOLOGY  
Research Approach  
This study uses a quantitative approach. Allison (2002) states that the quantitative approach is the best way to 
avoid error. Furthermore, the quantitative approach is more widely accepted, making it easier for respondents 
to make assessments to establish reliability and validity. In addition, the quantitative approach is appropriate 
for measuring the relationship between WLB and job satisfaction among nurses (McBurney, 1994).  
Sample and Sampling Techniques  
Sampling is a crucial process in research that involves selecting a subset of units from a larger population to 
conclu de the whole group (Van Haute, 2021). There are two primary sampling methods: probability sampling, 
which uses random selection, and non -probability sampling, based on convenience or other criteria. The choice 
of sampling technique and sample size determin ation are critical decisions that affect the accuracy and 
generalizability of research results (Singh & Masuku, 2014). This study's target population consists of nurses at 
a private hospital in Southern Malaysia. In order to determine the sample size, the researchers used Krejcie and 
Morgan's (1970) table. As a result, the sample in this study involved 56 nurses in the said hospital. The sample 
was determined using a non -probability sampling technique with saturated sampling. This technique involves 
all pop ulation members are used as a sample. A saturated sample can also be referred to as a census because all 
members of the nursing population involved are sampled.   
The Questionnaire  
This study uses primary data. Primary data is obtained through surveys using  questionnaires. Nurses from a 
private hospital in Southern Malaysia were approached to complete the survey through a Google Form. The 
questionnaire used Google Forms because it is practical, convenient, and transparent. Respondents are required 
to answer all questions. The questionnaire has 31 questions. Part A covers the respondents' demographic 
information, including their gender, age, job experience, and level of education. Part B covers 10 questions 
related to WLB regarding their ability to manage time and energy to meet personal and professional 
responsibilities. There are three factors included in the question which are the balance factor, the life factor, 
and the environment factor at the workplace. Finally, Part C covers a total of 14 questions that are relate d to 
job satisfaction, which measures job contentment and associated elements. All questions are closed -ended. The 
responses were measured using the 5 -point Likert scale, which ranges from strongly unlik ely to strongly likely . 
Data Analysis  
The researchers used Statistical Software Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27 to analyze data entry 
and statistical analysis. Descriptive analysis of frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation is use d to 
compare demographic information with job satisfaction. The relationship between quantitative variables was 
evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. A value of P ≤ 0.05 was used to determine statistical 
significance.

 variables, t he strength of this association is relatively modest. The significance level (p < .01) confirms that 
this weak relationship is unlikely to have occurred by chance.  
RESEARCH  DISCUSSION  
Level of Work -Life Balance  
The findings of this study show that although  the respondents have too much work to do, they do not consider 
that their work puts pressure on their personal lives. This shows that they have a balanced  WLB  and stay 
healthy . Even though they are bound by daily and overtime works, that does not prevent them from doing the 
things they like after the end of working hours. They were able to spend time on personal matters without 
being tied to matters at work.  This finding however, differ from those reported by  Ng et al. (2017) and Son and 
Jung (2019). Nonetheless, it parallels with the study found by Luthfia et al. (202 1). 
Level  of Job Satisfaction  
The research findings (M = 3.44, SD = 0.628) indicate a moderate level of job satisfaction among the 
respondents s tudied. This finding provides valuable insight into the workplace climate, suggesting neither 
widespread dissatisfaction nor exceptional enthusiasm but a generally positive outlook. There are two types of 
job satisfaction found in the dimension , i.e., affective and cognitive. Affective job satisfaction refers to the 
individual's emotional reaction to their job while cognitive focuses on the level of the respondents’  satisfaction 
in certain aspects of their job such as overtime, personal matters , or family m atters. These finding s correspond 
to those observed in previous studies  such as Haile et al. (2017) due to various factors such as work 
environment, spiritual factors, motivation (Yanriatuti et al., 2019), shift patterns, autonomy, staffing resources, 
and teamwork (Dilig -Ruiz et al., 2018).  
Relationship between Work -life Balance  and Job Satisfaction  
The weak positive correlation (r = 0.132) suggests that WLB is associated with job satisfaction, but the 
relationship is not as strong as expected. The low r -value (0.132) indicates that WLB, while significant, 
explains approximately 1.74% (r² = 0.0174) of the variance in job satisfaction among respondents. This finding 
corroborates with previous studies by Dargahpour et al. (2022) and Morsy and Sabra (2015). The  finding 
further suggests that job satisfaction is a complex construct influenced by multiple factors beyond WLB alone. 
Context factors such as the industry -specific dynamics might influence the modest correlation. The sample (N 
= 56) may represent a speci fic sector, i.e., a private hospital in Southern Malaysia where WLB affects job 
satisfaction differently than in other industries. Besides, cultural or organizational norms, such as prevailing 
attitudes toward work in the said organization, moderate how WL B translates to satisfaction. Finally, 
differences in personal values and career priorities among respondents could affect how strongly WLB 
influences their job satisfaction.  
Research Limitation  
 
The present research provides valuable insights into the relationship between WLB and job satisfaction. 
However, several important limitations must be acknowledged to contextualize the findings appropriately. 
First, in terms of methodological limitation, the correlational nature of this cross -sectional study rep resents a 
significant limitation as it captures only a snapshot of the WLB and job satisfaction relationship at a single 
point in time. This design prevents the establishment of causal relationships and temporal ordering between 
variables. WLB may influenc e job satisfaction, but job satisfaction could also affect perceptions of WLB, and 
unmeasured third variables could influence both. The temporal dynamics between these constructs remain 
unexplored, limiting our ability to understand how the relationship ev olves or responds to changing life and 
career circumstances. The study relied heavily on self -reported WLB and job satisfaction measures, 
introducing potential response biases, including social desirability and common method variance. Respondents 
may have consciously or unconsciously responded in ways they perceived as socially acceptable or desirable 
rather than reflecting their true experiences.

 Additionally, the specific instruments used to measure these constructs may capture only certain dimensions 
while potentially overlooking others, leading to an incomplete assessment of these multifaceted concepts. 
WLB, in particular, is a complex construct encompassing objective conditions and subjective perceptions, and 
our measurement approach may not have adequa tely captured this complexity. With a relatively small sample 
size (N = 56), the statistical power of the analysis may be insufficient to detect more minor effects or more 
complex relationships between variables. This limitation is particularly relevant wh en considering potential 
moderating or mediating factors influencing the primary relationship under investigation. The modest sample 
size increases the risk of missing meaningful relationships that exist in the population but were not detected in 
this stud y's analysis. The sample size also limited the ability to conduct more sophisticated analyses that might 
have revealed subtle patterns in the data.  
Second, the sample size of 56 respondents raises substantial questions about how representative the findings  
are of the broader working population. The demographic composition of the sample may not adequately reflect 
the diversity of workforce characteristics across different sectors, regions, or cultural contexts. This limitation 
to representativeness affects t he external validity of the study's findings and constrains the ability to generalize 
beyond the specific characteristics of the sample. Without a diverse and representative sample, important 
variations in how different demographic groups experience the re lationship between WLB and job satisfaction 
remain unexplored. The sample may be drawn from similar organizational contexts or industries, limiting the 
generalizability of findings across diverse workplace settings with varying norms, expectations, and str uctures 
related to work -life policies. Organizational culture and industry -specific practices can significantly influence 
WLB and job satisfaction, yet this study may not have adequately captured this contextual diversity. Without 
representation from vario us workplace environments, understanding how organizational factors influence the 
relationship between WLB and job satisfaction remains incomplete.  
Finally, in terms of analytical limitations, the study's analysis did not control for potentially confoundin g 
variables such as demographic factors (age, gender, family status), career -related variables (job tenure, 
hierarchical position, career stage), organizational factors (company size, industry, organizational culture), or 
individual difference variables (p ersonality traits, coping mechanisms, resilience). These omissions may result 
in an incomplete understanding of the relationship between WLB and job satisfaction. These unmeasured 
variables may influence the observed correlation coefficient, potentially ma sking more complex relationships 
or even spurious associations. Without controlling for these factors, the study cannot isolate the unique 
contribution of WLB to job satisfaction. The study did not investigate whether the relationship between WLB 
and job s atisfaction differs across subgroups based on demographic or professional characteristics, potentially 
masking important variations within the sample. Different demographic groups or professional cohorts may 
experience the relationship between WLB and job satisfaction differently, but this study's analysis treated the 
sample as homogeneous. This approach may obscure meaningful differences between subgroups and limit 
understanding of how personal and professional characteristics moderate the relationship bet ween our variables 
of interest.  
Moreover, the analytical approach assumed a linear relationship between variables, potentially overlooking 
more complex nonlinear patterns or threshold effects in how WLB relates to job satisfaction. There may be 
critical th resholds or inflexion points in the relationship that this study's correlation analysis could not detect. 
For instance, WLB may have diminishing returns or even curvilinear effects on job satisfaction that would 
require more sophisticated analytical techni ques to identify. While appropriate for an initial investigation, the 
simplicity of this study's analytical approach limits the ability to uncover more refined relationships between 
the variables.  
RECOMMENDATION  
Future studies should employ robust longitu dinal research designs with multiple measurement points to better 
understand the directionality of the relationship between WLB and job satisfaction. Longitudinal approaches 
allow researchers to examine how this relationship evolves over time and across ca reer stages, whether 
interventions to improve WLB yield subsequent changes in job satisfaction and the stability or volatility of 
both constructs over extended periods. By collecting data at multiple time points, researchers could establish 
temporal preced ence and provide more substantial evidence for causal relationships, addressing a fundamental

 limitation of the current cross -sectional design.  
In addition, researchers should develop more comprehensive measurement approaches that capture the full 
complexi ty of WLB and job satisfaction. This would involve utilizing multi -dimensional measures that 
acknowledge the various facets of these constructs and incorporating both subjective and objective indicators 
where possible. Experience sampling methods could cap ture real -time experiences rather than relying solely on 
retrospective assessments, which are subject to recall biases. Additionally, measurement instruments should be 
validated across diverse populations and contexts to ensure they function equivalently a cross different 
demographic groups and cultural settings, enhancing the generalizability of findings.  
Future studies would also benefit from applying more sophisticated analytical techniques to account for the 
complex relationship between WLB and job satis faction. Structural equation modelling could simultaneously 
test complex relationships among multiple variables, including potential mediators and moderators. 
Hierarchical linear modelling would be valuable for accounting for nested data structures, such a s employees 
within teams and teams within organizations. Latent profile analysis could identify distinct patterns in how 
individuals experience and manage work -life boundaries, moving beyond simple linear relationships to 
recognize different typologies of WLB experiences and their differential effects on job satisfaction.  
Additionally, future research should investigate the mediating mechanisms through which WLB influences job 
satisfaction. Potential exploration pathways include reduced role conflict and st ress, enhanced recovery 
experiences, improved psychological detachment from work, greater control and autonomy, and better physical 
and mental health outcomes. Understanding these mediating processes would provide valuable insights into 
why and how WLB aff ects job satisfaction, moving beyond simple bivariate relationships to a more process -
oriented understanding. This knowledge would be particularly valuable for designing targeted interventions 
focusing on the most influential pathways. Also, studies should  explore moderating factors that may strengthen 
or weaken the relationship between WLB and job satisfaction. These moderators could include individual 
difference variables (such as work centrality, family involvement, and boundary management preferences), 
organizational factors (including supportive supervision, organizational culture, and formal policies), 
occupational characteristics (job demands, job resources, schedule flexibility), and life stage and family 
structure variables. Identifying these modera ting influences would help explain the heterogeneity in how 
individuals experience the connection between WLB and job satisfaction, potentially accounting for the 
relatively modest correlation observed in the current study.  
Furthermore, future research sho uld investigate industry -specific dynamics to understand how WLB and job 
satisfaction vary across different industries and sectors, various occupational groups with different work 
demands and structures, and organizations with different sizes, structures, and resource constraints. Different 
professional contexts may create unique challenges and opportunities for achieving WLB, and understanding 
these contextual factors would enhance the practical relevance of research findings. Industry -specific studies 
allow for more tailored recommendations that account for the particular characteristics of different work 
environments.  
Future studies should adopt mixed -methods approaches to complement quantitative findings with qualitative 
insights. This methodological int egration would provide a richer contextual understanding of how individuals 
experience work -life balance, capture the complexity and subjectivity of work -life balance and job satisfaction 
constructs, identify novel factors and relationships not captured by  existing quantitative measures, and generate 
new theories and hypotheses for further testing. Qualitative approaches, such as in -depth interviews and focus 
groups, could uncover detailed aspects of the WLB experience that may be missed by standardized 
questionnaires, offering a more holistic understanding of these phenomena.  
By addressing these recommendations, future research can develop a more comprehensive understanding of 
the complex relationship between WLB and job satisfaction. This enhanced knowledg e would inform more 
effective organizational policies and individual strategies for enhancing both domains, benefiting employees, 
organizations, and societies more broadly. The modest correlation observed in the current study suggests there 
is much more to  learn about this relationship, and these recommended research directions provide a roadmap 
for advancing our understanding in meaningful ways.

 CONCLUSION  
In conclusion, the data obtained from this study will help the organization and the respondents measu re their 
WLB and job satisfaction. Even so, for the next generation of researchers, a suggestion that can be added is to 
consider the intricacies of a multiracial work environment. The ability of these results to provide constructive 
feedback on the relati onship between the two dimensions, as found in the research conducted, in addition to 
fostering higher work performance in the organization, highlighting the need and balance between work and 
life.
