ABSTRACT

Hypoxia and eutrophication were evident in Manila Bay during bay-wide field surveys
spanning wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, areas with low DO extended
northward toward the coast. Near bottom dissolved oxygen levels ranged from 0.12 to 9.22
mg l⁻¹. High nutrient levels coincide with low near-bottom DO. Hypoxia was worse during the wet season due to increased freshwater discharge and stratification. To better understand the oxygen dynamics in Manila Bay, a hydrodynamic and water quality
model was developed using DELFT3D. It reproduced wet season stratification, with
stratification forming and dissipating in 10-15 days. The model showed lower DO near the
coast, particularly the northern and eastern coast consistent with field surveys. In general,
higher DO levels were found during the dry season model run. Loading from the rivers
affected the DO levels at the surface up to 10 meters, while sediment oxygen demand
influenced the DO levels below the pycnocline and near the bottom. The model showed that
deoxygenation of the bay is not a permanent feature and can be alleviated with less loading from rivers as well as lower sediment oxygen demand. Efforts to improve the water quality in Manila Bay by reducing the organic and nutrient
loading from rivers may only be relevant to DO levels, initially, at the surface and upper
water layers. The importance of sediment oxygen demand emphasizes the possible time lag
of the effects of these rehabilitation efforts due to residual SOD (from old sediments).
However, DO/hypoxia clears up in the near bottom waters in ~ 2 weeks with lower SOD
suggesting that the feature may not be permanent in Manila Bay. However, hypoxia is likely a recurring phenomenon as seen in the field observations. A watershed model was also developed to estimate nutrient loads coming from the Manila
Bay watershed. It revealed that 66% of total nitrogen (TN) and 59% of total phosphorus (TP)
came from domestic sources. Agricultural activities contributed 22% of TN and 30% of TP.
Densely populated provinces contributed major domestic waste loads, while rural provinces
contributed most to agricultural nutrient loads. Smaller but densely populated watersheds like Pasig and Cavite contributed significantly to nutrient loading. The nutrient load model was used to analyze different scenarios for the future of Manila
Bay, considering factors such as population growth, urban development, connection to
sewage systems, and wastewater treatment. This tool provided a relatively swift assessment
of nutrient sources and possible scenarios, considering different options for policymakers and management bodies. The field and modeling studies conducted in this research are a step toward understanding
the ecosystem of Manila Bay. The hydrodynamic and water quality model shows how
changing nutrient loading impacts oxygen depletion. The spatially explicit modeling of
loading sources using scenarios helps to design strategies focused on specific areas where mitigation can be efficient. Although the approaches used have limitations, they proved to be useful for interpreting
results from field studies and understanding the ecosystem dynamics concerning oxygen
depletion, and for evaluating different policies that are geared towards improving the status of the Bay in terms of water quality.

1. Chapter 1: Introduction and overview of the study

Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an important aspect of the marine ecosystem that is essential for
sustaining most marine life. Hypoxia occurs when DO levels fall below 2 mg I"? (or ~30%
saturation). At these oxygen levels, animals generally begin to feel the effects of suffocation.
At its worst, hypoxia can cause mass mortality of fish and invertebrates and lead to the
formation of “dead zones” where very little marine life can survive due to the lack of oxygen.
It can also cause major shifts in community structure and production of the entire ecosystem
as well as affect the reproductive system of fish (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008; Wu, 2009).
Eutrophication of coastal ecosystems, brought on by nutrient enrichment that causes
increased primary production and hence accumulation of organic matter, contributes to the
formation of hypoxia (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008; Nixon, 1995; Rabalais et al., 2009). Water
column stratification also contributes to the formation of hypoxia and anoxia by preventing

the vertical diffusion of oxygen from the upper to the lower layers (Rabalais et al., 2001).

Hypoxic systems, or “dead zones,” have spread and expanded in area significantly in coastal
systems around the world since the 1960s. They affect a total area of more than 245,000
km? and are primarily associated with populated areas and watersheds that deliver large
quantities of nutrients to coastal waters (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008). The World Resources
Institute (WRI) along with the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) has identified more
than 530 low-oxygen zones and an additional 228 sites exhibiting eutrophication worldwide
(2011). However, studies on hypoxia have been conducted mostly in North America and
Europe and have focused on hypoxic systems found in the Baltic and Kattegat Seas, the
northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Chesapeake Bay (Karlson et al., 2002; Kemp et al., 2005;
Rabalais and Turner, 2001). Very few studies have focused on the hypoxic systems in
Southeast Asia, Japan, Hong Kong, and China (Chen, 2007; Kodama et al., 2006; Wu, 1982).
With this considered, more water bodies may be affected especially in developing nations

where monitoring studies may not be in place (Breitburg et al., 2018).

In Manila Bay, Philippines, fisheries and aquaculture are major sources of livelihood
(PEMSEA and MBEMP-MBIN, 2007), and they can be adversely affected by the occurrence of
hypoxia. Hypoxia and eutrophication have been previously observed in Manila Bay, with

near-bottom DO levels in the bay falling to 1 mg I (June 2008) and nutrient levels exceeding

the ASEAN water quality criteria (Chang et al., 2009; Jacinto et al., 2006). The bay is also

affected by harmful algal blooms, persistent red tides, heavy metal pollution, and excess
organic loads (Azanza et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2009; Jacinto et al., 2006; Prudente et al.,
1994; Reichardt et al., 2006). The total load of organic matter in Manila Bay was estimated
at 250,000 tons of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) per year, and < 20% of the sewage
discharged into the bay is treated (PEMSEA and MBEMP-MBIN, 2007).

More recent studies by the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI)
and UP MSI also reported the occurrence of deoxygenation and hypoxia in the bay (Jacinto
et al,, 2011; Sotto et al., 2014; Sy et al., 2016). Surveys done during the wet season
consistently showed evidence of stratification and hypoxia (which was often more severe
during the wet season). Minimal improvement over time was observed throughout the
seasonal/annual surveys though in September 2015, conditions seemed to have improved
with the near-bottom bay-wide average DO reaching 4.5 mg I" (Sy et al., 2016). Data froma
2019 field survey shows DO < 5.0 mg I" for stations in the middle of the bay at 10-25 m with
an oxycline at less than 10 m (Tolentino and Onda, 2019) which is shallower than previous
surveys. Current issues that affect the bay are various reclamation projects that may have
detrimental effects on the ecosystem of the bay due to increased sediment input and

hindrances to water flow (DENR, 2023).

The rehabilitation of Manila Bay is a continuing effort of the government in compliance with
the Writ of Mandamus issued by the Supreme Court on December 18, 2008. Under the
Order, the SC directed 13 agencies of the government, including the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), “to clean up, rehabilitate, and preserve the Bay,
and restore and maintain its water to Class $B level - fit for swimming, skin diving, and other
forms of contact recreation.” Policy makers and environmental managers therefore need to

be informed about the impact of certain strategies.


Since then, water quality management areas in the National Capital Region (NCR), Region Ill,
and Region IV-A have been established; rivers and creeks were cleaned via the “Adopt an
Estero Program,” and materials recovery facilities (MRFs) were built in cities around the bay.
Several studies and monitoring efforts in collaboration with agencies such as the Laguna
Lake Development Authority (LLDA) for the Laguna de Bay Ecosystem Report Card;
Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for river quality monitoring; and
Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia (PEMSEA) for various
ecosystem, pollution loading, risk assessment, and economic development studies

were also undertaken.

Several sub-agencies and offshoot projects were also developed such as the Manila Bay
Coordinating Office (MBCO) and the Manila Bay Sustainable Development Master Plan
(MBSDMP) led by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA).

The field surveys and modeling work done in this study was in collaboration with several of
the agencies and organizations working to address the rehabilitation of Manila Bay. At
present, most of the monitoring efforts conducted by the different agencies and LGUs are
ongoing in addition to several proposed projects to further study the ecosystem

of Manila Bay.

An article claiming Manila Bay as a “dead body of water” without fish, or any marine life
made the rounds earlier in the year (2023) which was quickly refuted by organizations like
OCEANA and data from BFAR and DENR. Though plagued with several environmental issues,
it is far from dead or lifeless. As Oceana VP puts it, “Manila Bay is a life-sustaining ecosystem
for many fishes, mangroves, and birds.” The bay is identified by BFAR as a spawning area for
sardines and is still one of the main fishing grounds for artisanal fisherfolk. There are also
reef areas in Cavite and Corregidor with fair to good live coral cover. Further damage to the
Manila Bay ecosystem is feared due to the numerous reclamation projects in place
(ucanews.com; OCEANA, 2023; Baclig, 2023).

1.1 Objectives

As part of the continued efforts to monitor the water quality of Manila Bay, address the
environmental problems, and support rehabilitation efforts, this study

has three main objectives:

1. Establish the spatiotemporal variability of oxygen and inorganic nutrients in Manila
Bay through bay-wide field surveys;

2. Understand the dynamics of oxygen in Manila Bay through hydrodynamic and
water quality modeling;

3. Evaluate different scenarios in terms of nutrient loading from the

Manila Bay watershed.

These objectives are addressed across three main chapters, in addition to this introduction

and synthesis in chapter 5.

Chapter 1: Introduction and overview of the study (this chapter)

Chapter 2: Spatiotemporal variability of hypoxia and eutrophication in

Manila Bay, Philippines

Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic and water quality modeling of hypoxia in Manila Bay, Philippines
Chapter 4: Nutrient loads from domestic and agricultural activities in the

Manila Bay watershed

Chapter 5: Synthesis

Chapter 2 builds on field studies conducted in Manila Bay and aims to be a spatially
extensive assessment of hypoxia and eutrophication of the system during the two major
seasonal regimes: the northeast monsoon (cold and dry) and the southwest monsoon (wet).
The goal of Chapter 2 is to obtain a better understanding of the spatial and temporal extent
of hypoxia, identify seasonal differences in the occurrence of hypoxia as influenced by
stratification, salinity, and freshwater discharge, and evaluate the role of eutrophication in

promoting hypoxia in the bay.

To better understand the dynamics of oxygen in Manila Bay, Chapter 3 presents a model
that describes the hydrodynamics and water quality of the bay. This model is used to

reproduce the field observations of dissolved oxygen and other parameters; after testing the

model, scenarios for nutrient and organic matter loading, and sediment oxygen demand
were used to analyze the response of the Manila Bay ecosystem to these changes
concerning dissolved oxygen, and thus evaluate the possible effects of rehabilitation efforts

for the bay.

Apart from improving our understanding, a further advantage of using models is the ability
to test different scenarios and use the results to address different policy issues in the
rehabilitation and pollution management of Manila Bay. For example, since the sewage
system in the Philippines is still largely underdeveloped, scenarios that tackle the
effectiveness of sewage treatment were investigated to help assess the significance of
interventions related to sewage treatment. Another example is the effect of the ever-
increasing population in the National Capital Region (watershed of Manila Bay) on the waste
loading into the bay. Chapter 4 describes the use of models to analyze different futures for
Manila Bay in terms of population growth, urban development, connection to sewage
systems, and wastewater treatment. Low-cost solutions like regulating the level of

phosphorus in detergents are also explored.

Finally, chapter 5 is a synthesis of all the work presented in this dissertation.

ABSTRACT

Manila Bay, Philippines is a major port near Metro Manila, an overpopulated city with poor
sewage systems. Activities in the bay's watershed include domestic as well as agricultural
activities. These activities often lead to untreated waste draining into the bay which leads to
environmental problems such as declining oxygen levels, harmful algal blooms and “red
tides,” and plastic pollution. Bay-wide water sampling and CTD deployments were

conducted during five field surveys to assess the status of the bay's water quality.

Evidence of hypoxia and eutrophication emerged from comprehensive field surveys across
31 stations in Manila Bay, Philippines, These surveys spanned both the wet, southwest
monsoon seasons (July 2010, August 2011, and August 2012) and the dry northeast

monsoon seasons (February 2010 and 2011). During the wet season, bottom hypoxia

extended northward from the central area toward the coast, exhibiting dissolved oxygen

(DO) levels ranging from 0.12 to 9.22 mg | and a bay-wide average dropping to 2.10 mg I.

Nutrient levels were elevated, especially near the bottom where dissolved inorganic
nitrogen reached 22.3 4M (July 2010) and phosphorus reached 5.61 uM (August 2011). High

nutrient concentrations often coincided with low near-bottom DO.
Hypoxia in Manila Bay is predominant during the southwest monsoon (wet season), with

increased freshwater discharge intensifying water column stratification and contributing to

the exacerbation of hypoxic conditions.


2.1 Introduction

Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an important aspect of the marine ecosystem essential for
sustaining most marine life. Hypoxia occurs when DO levels fall below 2 mg I-1 (or ~30%
saturation). At these oxygen levels, animals generally begin to feel the effects of suffocation.
At its worst, hypoxia can cause mass mortality of fish and invertebrates and lead to the
formation of dead zones where very little marine life can survive. It can also cause major
shifts in community structure and production of the entire ecosystem (Diaz and Rosenberg,
2008). Eutrophication of coastal ecosystems, brought on by nutrient enrichment that causes
increased primary production and hence accumulation of organic matter, contributes to the
formation of hypoxia (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008; Nixon, 1995; Rabalais et al., 2009). Water
column stratification also contributes to the formation of hypoxia and anoxia by preventing

the vertical diffusion of oxygen from the upper to the lower layers (Rabalais et al., 2001).

Hypoxic systems, or “dead zones,” have spread and expanded in area significantly in coastal
systems around the world since the 1960s. They affect a total area of more than 245,000
km? and are primarily associated with populated areas and watersheds that deliver large
quantities of nutrients to coastal waters (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008). The World Resources
Institute (WRI) along with the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) has identified more
than 530 low-oxygen zones and an additional 228 sites exhibiting eutrophication worldwide
(2011). However, studies on hypoxia have been conducted mostly in North America and
Europe and have focused on hypoxic systems found in the Baltic and Kattegat Seas, the
northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Chesapeake Bay (Karlson et al., 2002; Kemp et al., 2005;
Nancy N Rabalais and Turner, 2001). Very few studies have focused on the hypoxic systems
in Southeast Asia, Japan, Hong Kong, and China (Chen, 2007; Kodama et al., 2006; Wu,
1982). With this considered, more water bodies may be affected especially in developing

nations where monitoring studies may not be in place (Breitburg et al., 2018).

In Manita Bay, Philippines, fisheries and aquaculture are major sources of livelihood
(PEMSEA and MBEMP-MBIN, 2007), and they can be adversely affected by the occurrence of
hypoxia. Hypoxia and eutrophication have been previously observed in Manila Bay, with
near-bottom DO levels in the bay falling to 1 mg I? (June 2008) and nutrient levels exceeding
the ASEAN water quality criteria (Chang et al., 2009; Jacinto et al., 2006). The bay is also
affected by harmful algal blooms, persistent red tides, heavy metal pollution, and excess

organic loads (Azanza et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2009; Jacinto et al., 2006; Prudente et al.,

1994; Reichardt et al., 2006). The total load of organic matter in Manila Bay was estimated
at 250,000 tons of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD}/year, and < 20% of the sewage
discharged into the bay is treated (PEMSEA and MBEMP-MBIN, 2007).

Establishing the levels, trends, and spatiotemporal variability in Manila Bay in terms of
dissolved oxygen and nutrients is important in understanding the dynamics of nutrient
loading and hypoxia in Manila Bay which will lead to establishing better monitoring and
management practices for recovery of the ecosystem. This study builds on previous work
conducted in Manila Bay and aims to be a spatially extensive assessment of hypoxia and
eutrophication of the system during the two major seasonal regimes: the northeast
monsoon (cold and dry) and the southwest monsoon (wet). The goal of this study is to
obtain a better understanding of the spatial and temporal extent of hypoxia, identify
seasonal differences in the occurrence of hypoxia as influenced by stratification, salinity, and
freshwater discharge, and evaluate the role of eutrophication in promoting hypoxia

in the bay.

2.2 Materials and Methods

2.2.1 Study site

The watershed of Manila Bay has an estimated area of 19,720 km? and is home to 31 million
people or 34% of the total population of the Philippines (BSWM, 2012; NSO, 2010).
Agricultural areas constitute 42%, miscellaneous land use areas (including built-up or urban
areas) make up 22%, grass/shrubland areas comprise 21%, forest, and woodland areas

constitute 11%, and wetland areas make up 4% (BSWM, 2012).

Only about 16% of the households in the major cities around the bay have sewer coverage,
making poor waste management a big part of the bay’s environmental problems (Olchondra,
2011). In the megacity of Metro Manila where close to 13 million people reside, only 15%
are connected to a sewerage system with only half provided with sewage treatment. About.
85% of the population in Metro Manila has septic tanks which are often poorly constructed.
Regular servicing of tanks only started with the implementation of the Manila Second

Sewerage Project in 1996 (Campos, 2007).


The bay receives freshwater input from numerous rivers, including the Pasig and Pampanga
Rivers, which contribute 70% of the freshwater influx (25 km? y*) (PRRP, 1999). The dry

season is from December to May and the wet season covers the rest of the year.

2.2.2 Water sampling

A total of 31 sampling stations throughout Manila Bay were occupied during five field
surveys: 2 during the dry season (northeast monsoon) in February 2010 and 2011 and 3
during the wet season (southwest monsoon) in July 2010, August 2011, and August 2012
(Figure 2.1). Two replicate water samples from at least three depths (surface, mid-depth, or
sub-surface chlorophyll-a max, and near-bottom) were collected using a 5-I Niskin sampler.
Near-bottom water samples were collected at 1 meter above the recorded bottom depth
from the echo sounder. Samples for analysis of inorganic nutrients were filtered through a
0.45 UM Sartorius CA membrane filter and kept frozen until analysis. Additional water
samples for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis were collected during the August 2011
and 2012 field surveys due to the availability of sampling and analysis equipment. These
samples were filtered through a pre-combusted 0.7 uM Whatman GF/F filter, preserved with
concentrated phosphoric acid, and kept frozen until analysis. Depth, salinity, temperature,

fluorescence, and DO profiles were obtained at each site using a YSI Sonde 650 MDS


(February 2010), SEABIRD SBE-25 CTD (July 2010, February 2011, and August 2011), anda
SEABIRD SBE-19 CTD (August 2012) whichever was available.

2.2.3 Analysis

Ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, and silicate concentrations of the seawater samples

were measured using methods modified from Strickland and Parsons (1972) for use with a
SKALAR SANS ++ segmented flow analyzer D500. Total organic carbon content was
determined as the non-purgeable organic carbon fraction using a Shimadzu

TOCV-5000 analyzer.

Isosurface plots, profiles, and section plots for the different physiochemical parameters
were generated using Golden Software Surfer 10 (Golden Software Inc., 2012) while the
scatter plots were generated using Ocean Data Viewer (Schlitzer, 2018). A principal
component analysis (PCA) was also performed on the water quality data to determine
correlations and relationships between parameters, particularly dissolved oxygen

and salinity.

Near-bottom DO levels for Manila Bay were as low as 0.12 mg I” in August 2012 during the
wet season (Figure 2.2E, Table 2.1). Waters near the coast and up to the middle of the bay
during the wet season surveys were hypoxic, with bay-wide averages falling to as low as 2.10


mg |* (August 2011). In August 2012, DO concentrations improved along the coast, but the
midsection of the bay remained hypoxic. No hypoxia was observed during the dry season in
February 2011 (Figure 2.2C).

In the water column, the water depths at which hypoxia occurred ranged from 5 m (wet

Figure 2.3. Dissolved oxygen profiles for Station 19 located in the middle of the bay.


In February 2010 during the dry season, the oxycline (the depth at which DO declines
rapidly) started at around 10 m. In the succeeding wet season surveys, the oxyclines began
as shallow as 5 m and more stations exhibited rapidly declining DO above 10 m; these results
are indicative of worsening conditions for the bay. For example, the DO profiles for Station
19 show that the oxycline became shallower from February 2010 to July 2010 (Figure 2.3). In
February 2011, no hypoxia was observed, but in August 2011 the oxycline was again
shallower (< 10 m), and bottom hypoxia occurred. In August 2012, the oxycline was deeper
but DO levels below 10 m are less than 4 mg | and are steadily decreasing with depth.

The thickness of the hypoxic layer (maximum depth minus the minimum depth at which DO
<2 mg!" and remains hypoxic) averaged 3.5 m for the four surveys where hypoxia was
observed (February 2010, July 2010, August 2011, and August 2012). The maximum
thickness increased with time, reaching 15-18 m during the August 2011 and 2012 wet

season surveys.

Cross-section profiles for transects running along a north-south axis from the head of the
bay to the mouth and a west-east axis from the coast of Bataan to Metro Manila were
plotted to show the gradient of DO and nutrient levels in moving away from the coast and
along the midsection of the bay (Figure 2.4). Along the north-south cross-section, DO is
usually high on the surface and becomes lower at depth. During the February 2010 survey
(dry, northeast monsoon), near-bottom hypoxia was observed starting from 10 until 30 km
offshore along the north-south axis (head to mouth of bay) (Figure 2.4A). The same stretch
had low near-bottom dissolved oxygen (4-6 mg I”) in the following year’s survey for the

same season (Figure 2.4C).

During the wet southwest monsoon surveys, near-bottom low dissolved oxygen ranging
from 2-4 mg 7 was found starting at the coast and extending up to 30 km offshore for the
north-south cross-section (Figure 2.48, 2.4D, 2.4). The west-east cross-section profiles for
the dry season survey (February 2010) showed that the western part of the bay had lower
near-bottom DO levels along the midsection (Figure 2.4F). During the rainy season, the
whole midsection from west to east had low near-bottom DO ranging from 0-4 mg I” (Figure
2.46, 2.41, 2.4). During August 2012 (Figure 2.4)), more than half of the water column had
DO below 4 mg". For all the transects, more areas of the water column have decreased DO

levels between 4-6 mg |? during the wet season surveys (shown in green in Figure 2.4).

2.3.2. Eutrophication

Surface inorganic nutrient levels in general were higher near and along the coasts, especially
off Manila, Cavite, Bulacan, and Pampanga coinciding where chlorophyll-a levels are often
elevated (Figure 2.5). During the two dry season surveys, surface total inorganic nitrogen
(TIN), consisting mostly of nitrate and ammonium, increased whereas surface phosphate
and silicate levels decreased. For the three wet season surveys, surface TIN decreased from

July 2010 to August 2011 and increased in August 2012, whereas surface phosphate and


silicate levels increased over time (Table 2.2). Through the five field surveys, surface

phosphate seems to be increasing over time.

Surface chlorophyll-a values were usually higher near the coastal areas of the bay, especially

near Manila, Cavite, Pampanga, and Bataan (Figure 2.5E, 2.5F). In February 2011, very high


values (20-41 1g |") were observed throughout the water column at Station 29, which lies in

the southern area of the bay near Bataan. Over time, average surface chlorophyll-a levels

were relatively unchanged, although they were higher in August 2012 than during the other

surveys (Table 2.2).

Near the bottom, nutrient levels were often higher at the midsection of the bay and near the

coast, especially along the eastern side near Metro Manila and Cavite (Figure 2.6). Nutrient
levels exceeded the ASEAN Water Quality Criteria (ASEAN, 2004) for NOz and NOsin bottom

waters in August 2011 (Table 2.2). These areas of high nutrient levels usually coincide with

low near-bottom DO levels. TIN and phosphate levels decreased from the first dry season

survey to the second. No trend was observed for the wet season surveys, although nutrient

levels were generally higher than those measured during the dry season. Near-bottom

silicate levels remained relatively constant over time (Table 2.2).

DOC at the surface was highest near the coasts of Bulacan and Metro Manila and lowest in
the eastern and western parts of the bay near Bataan and Cavite (Figure 2.7A, 2.7C). Near-
bottom DOC concentration (Figure 2.7B, 2.7D) was elevated along the northern and
northwestern coast near Pampanga, Bulacan, Metro Manila, and Cavite. A slight decrease in
the surface average was seen between the two surveys (August 2011 and 2012), whereas
the near-bottom average remained about the same. However, an increase in the maximum
DOC concentration was found in both surface and near-bottom waters between August
2011 and 2012 (Table 2.2).

(8) and for August 2012 at the surface (C) and near-bottom (D).

Total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), silicate, and phosphate were higher near the bottom along
the north-south cross-section. The stretch from 10-30 km consistently had elevated TIN that
reached up to the coast during the wet season (Figure 2.8). The same 20 km stretch also had

high phosphate and silicate, especially during the dry season surveys (Figure 2.9). In general,


near-bottom nutrient levels were higher near the coast along the north-south section. Along
the west-east cross section, silicate, TIN, and phosphate, in general, were higher near the
coasts (both east and west) offshore Bataan and Metro Manila. Often, higher nutrient levels
at the western coast coincided with lower salinity values suggesting submarine groundwater
discharge as a possible source for these high nutrient levels. The other cross-section plots for
inorganic nutrients can be found in Appendix 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4,

2.3.3 Physical properties

The salinity profiles (Figure 2.10) for the wet seasons of July 2010 (blue), August 2011 (lime
green), and August 2012 (red) exhibited stratification. In contrast, the profiles for February
2010 (purple) and February 2011 (green) showed a relatively well-mixed water column with
slight stratification in some stations during February 2010 within the range of 3-4 PSU units.
Stratification due to salinity differences was observed during all surveys except in February
2011 (dry). Density changes are mainly salinity-driven; thus, the density profiles were similar
to the salinity profiles. Cross-section profiles for salinity clearly show the occurrence of
stratification in the bay during the wet season surveys (Appendix 2.1).

Very strong stratification was observed during the August 2012 survey: The average density
difference (Ac) between surface and bottom waters was 16.1 kg m®. In February 2010, slight
stratification was observed (Ac of 1.52 kg m*), which increased to 2.11 kg m’° in July 2010. In
February 2011, Ac was 0.26 kg m°, indicating a well-mixed water column, and in August

2011 strong stratification was again observed (Ao of 9.92 kg m*).

The T-S profiles (Figure 2.11) during the two dry season surveys (February 2010, February

2011, NE monsoon) were characterized by high salinities, low temperatures, and oxic
conditions. Higher temperatures were observed for the wet season in July 2010 and August
2011 (SW monsoon). A wider range of salinities and temperatures was observed for August
2012 during the wet season. Low bottom DO (red) was observed throughout the three

surveys during the wet season, often associated with higher salinities.

2.3.4 Principal component analysis

A principal component analysis was performed for the surface and bottom water quality
data. The Pearson correlation matrix for the five variables used in the PCA analysis is shown
in Table 2.3. Dissolved oxygen was found to be negatively correlated with depth, nitrate,
TIN, salinity, and phosphate and positively correlated with chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll a was
found to be negatively correlated with salinity, depth, and nitrate and positively correlated
with dissolved oxygen and phosphate. The same negative correlation between dissolved
oxygen, nutrients, depth, and salinity was observed in field surveys of the whole bay by

NFRDI from 2012 to 2015 (Sy et al., 2016).

2.4 Discussion

Low dissolved oxygen and hypoxic conditions were often observed in the central area of the
bay, where the relatively deep waters favor stratification, Stratification prevents the
aeration of the bottom waters, thereby promoting DO depletion. Relatively low DO levels
were observed in these areas, even during the February 2011 (dry season) survey when no
hypoxia was recorded. The hypoxic area of the near-bottom waters increased during the wet
season, covering more than half of the bay in July 2010 and August 2011 (Figure 2.2). In
August 2012, the hypoxic area covered the midsection of the bay as well as parts of the

coast offshore Pampanga, Metro Manila, and Cavite.

Thus, hypoxia in Manila Bay is not permanent but a seasonal phenomenon. It is generally
absent or weaker during the dry season when freshwater discharge into the bay is small, and
forms or worsens during the wet season due to the increased discharge from the rivers
which, apart from promoting stratification, also introduce nutrients that drive primary
production. In turn, this increases organic matter input into the system, which contributes to

the depletion of DO upon its decomposition.

Several results point to the worsening state of hypoxia in Manila Bay over the last few years
and in terms of the affected area. The DO profiles show that the oxycline became shallower
over time, with more stations having oxyclines at less than 10 m during the wet seasons of
August 2011 and 2012. This may affect the pelagic organisms, especially commercially
important fishes that are forced to migrate as DO levels in their surrounding water decrease
leading to habitat compression. in the Southern Atlantic, a shallow oxycline was found to
have a strong influence on the distribution and availability of skipjack tuna schools (Ingham

et al., 1977).

In Manila Bay, hypoxia occurred not only near the bottom but in the water column as well; it
was found as shallow as 5 m in a 10 m water column and with as much as 80% of the water
column being hypoxic (in August 2011). In comparison, in the Northern Gulf of Mexico,
hypoxia was as shallow as 2 m in a 10 m water column and encompassed 10-80% of the
water column (Rabalais and Turner, 2001). In the current study, more of the water column
became hypoxic over time at some stations, as shown by the increasing maximum thickness
of the hypoxic layer. The total area near the bottom affected by oxygen depletion also

increased with time, especially during the wet season when more than half of the bay had

oxygen-depleted bottom waters. A similar overall increasing trend in the area affected by
hypoxia was observed in the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary in China (Zhu et al., 2011).

Stratification of the water column prevents re-aeration of the bottom layer and the
downward diffusion of DO, thereby contributing to oxygen depletion of the bottom waters
due to respiration and decomposition (Rabalais et al., 1999). Strong stratification due to
salinity was observed in Manila Bay during all the surveys where hypoxia occurred. During
the wet season, the influence of salinity was more pronounced due to the increased
freshwater influx from the rivers around the bay, notably the Pasig and Pampanga Rivers,
which contribute on average 70% of the influx into the bay (~25 km? y*) (PEMSEA and
MBEMP-MBIN, 2007).

Two weeks before the August 2012 survey, a large amount of rain fell in Metro Manila for 8
days (August 1-8), causing heavy flooding in 59 cities/municipalities in three regions. The
event was given the name “Hagupit ng Habagat” as it coincided with the southwest
monsoon strengthened by Typhoon Haikui. In 48 hours, 687.1 mm of accumulated rainfall
was recorded and in 3 days from August 6-8, 2012, a total of 1,007.40 mm of rain was
recorded in Science Garden in QC (PAGASA, 2012; Rappler.com, 2013). The large amount of
freshwater discharge may have contributed to the strong stratification observed in the late

August 2012 survey, which in turn promoted the formation of hypoxia.

Consistently, surveys done by the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute
(NFRDI) during the wet season months of July to November from 2012-2013 and September
2014 showed evidence of stratification. Hypoxia was also observed in the bay during these
months (Sy et al., 2016). A similar phenomenon occurred in the Changjiang River estuary
after a destructive flood in August 1998, when freshwater from river discharge reached as
far as 400 km offshore, hypoxia occurred 200 km offshore, and a large area of low DO
formed in the near-bottom waters along the pathway of the discharge (Lie et al., 2003;

Wang and Wang, 2007; Zhu et al., 2011).

Wind-driven circulation models of the bay show two asymmetrical, counter-rotating gyres
separated along the midsection of the bay during periods of southwesterly and
northeasterly blowing winds (De Las Alas and Sodusta, 1985; Villanoy and Martin, 1997).

These wind patterns and resultant current patterns can affect sediment and debris transport


so that it accumulates in the midsection of the bay; there the organic matter can settle and,
upon sinking, contribute to the depletion of DO (Jacinto et al., 2011). Although the
circulation, bathymetry, and sediment distribution patterns suggest that sediments from the
Pasig River are generally displaced north of the source, sediments may be transported
offshore through the middle of the bay (Siringan and Ringor, 1998;

Villanoy and Martin, 1997).

In Manila Bay, nutrient levels were found to be elevated, especially near the bottom. The
mobilization of nutrients and organic matter from the watershed due to rain during the wet
season can contribute to the depletion of DO in the water column by stimulating the growth
of phytoplankton and hence increasing the organic matter input into the system. Chlorophyll
a biomass was usually found to be elevated along the coasts. Nearshore activities and
pollution sources in these areas include fishponds, wetlands, and agricultural areas of
Bulacan, the built-up and densely populated urban areas of Metro Manila and Cavite, and
the shellfish aquaculture activities offshore Cavite. Surface TIN and phosphate levels were
also highest around these areas, which suggests that increased nutrient loading caused the
increased phytoplankton biomass and likely, primary production, in the area. More recent
field surveys in Manila Bay conducted by the NFRDI from 2012 - 2015 found higher nitrate
concentrations as compared with this study. Higher nutrient concentrations were also found

at and near the coast (Sy et al., 2016).

In the northern Gulf of Mexico, high rates of primary production along the inner shelf can be
attributed to nutrient loading from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers. However, there is
a lag time between nutrient delivery and production in the surface waters (Rabalais and
Turner, 2001 and references therein). Hence, the observed elevated chlorophyll-a biomass
for Manila Bay may not be directly related to high nutrient levels observed in the area at the
same time. High surface TIN and phosphate levels are often found near the shore close to
the mouths of major rivers (e.g., Pampanga and Pasig Rivers), which carry a major amount of
runoff from the catchment area of the bay. Runoff from these areas includes domestic,

industrial, and agricultural waste.

A study found submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in the Bataan area (along the
western coast of Manila Bay) together with elevated nutrients. The SGD flux was estimated

to be about 12.4 mm" day” with the magnitude of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) input


from the SGD flux roughly estimated to be 42% of the Pampanga River and 96% of the Pasig
River input (Robert, 2010; Taniguchi et al., 2008). Results from the field surveys show that
the western part of the bay had elevated near-bottom nutrient levels in areas where

relatively lower salinity was also found suggesting SGD flux as the possible source of these

elevated nutrients.

The midsection of the Bay often had high near-bottom TIN values that coincided with areas
where DO levels were low. This pattern suggests that nitrification may be responsible for DO
depletion in the area (Zhang and Li, 2010). The high phosphate levels in areas with low DO
could indicate increased phosphate flux from the sediments, which often occurs in hypoxic
areas (Hu et al., 2001; Mort et al., 2010).

DOC can be a representative index for dissolved organic matter (Salonen et al., 1992). Itis a
source of organic pollution and can either be autochthonous (cellular content of littoral and
pelagic flora) or allochthonous (sourced from land) (Wetzel, 1983). In Manila Bay, the high
DOC at the surface could represent high primary productivity in the area. DOC is produced
daily as part of the primary and secondary production in the surface ocean, but high DOC

concentrations are also associated with phytoplankton blooms (Hansell and Carlson, 2001).

High DOC at the surface off the coasts of Bulacan and Metro Manila in August 2011
coincided with elevated chlorophyll-a levels in the same area. In the areas offshore Manila,
Bulacan, and Pampanga, near-bottom DOC levels were elevated in places where phosphate
levels were high. This indicates that the increased flux of organic matter to the area led to
DO depletion, which is usually accompanied by increased phosphate flux from the
sediments. In a 2008 survey, the total organic carbon (TOC) in the surface sediments from
Manila Bay was found to range from 0.9% to 3.1% (avg. 2.1%). The midsection of the bay
and the coast near Metro Manila was found to have the highest organic carbon content in
the sediments contributing to the DO depletion in the area (Jacinto et al., 2011). Inorganic
nitrogen levels were also elevated along these parts of the Bay, particularly offshore Metro
Manila. Along the northern part of the bay, low near-bottom DO values were also found

near the coast during the wet season.

Arecent fisheries survey (2014-2015) on Manila Bay revealed that the estimated demersal

fish biomass of the bay declined by 90% since a 1947 baseline study. Moreover, it was found


that the fish catch was dominated by pelagic species showing a shift from demersal species.
This shift is a possible consequence of habitat compression due to the occurrence of hypoxia
in the near-bottom part of the bay, rendering it incapable of supporting life for a variety of
fish species (Bendafio et al., 2016).

Field surveys done by the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI)
from 2012 to 2015 occupying 16 stations every other month show the occurrence of hypoxia
all year round especially near the coast and near the bottom at the deeper areas of the bay.
They also found hypoxia to be more severe during the wet season and low DO
concentrations associated with high nutrient concentrations, particularly nitrate (Sy et al.,
2016). The bay-wide average for near-bottom DO during the NFRDI wet season surveys was
2.36 mg I" in September 2012 which was slightly lower than the 2.45 mg I"! average found in
August 2012 from this study. Through time, the bay-wide averages for near-bottom DO
during the wet season were 2.91 mg I" and 2.99 mg I"'in July and September 2014 and 2.88
mg I" in September 2014 showing minimal improvement throughout time. In the following
wet season of September 2015, conditions seemed to have improved with the near-bottom

bay wide average reaching 4.46 mg !? (sy et al., 2016).

2.5 Summary, conclusion, and Recommendations

This study showed that hypoxia in Manila Bay varied in space and time. The lowest D0
values were observed during the wet season and coincided with stratification and elevated
nutrient levels, phytoplankton biomass, chlorophyll-a content, and organic carbon input, all
of which contributed to the depletion of DO. The area of hypoxic near-bottom waters also
increased during the wet season, spreading northwards toward the coast. A shoaling
oxycline and an increasing thickness of the hypoxic layer were also observed over time,
indicating problematic conditions for the bay like habitat compression for pelagic species,
especially during the wet season. High inorganic nitrogen and phosphate levels are often
accompanied by low DO concentration in the near-bottom waters indicative of nitrification
and increased sediment phosphate flux. More frequent field surveys and time-series
analyses are needed to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of hypoxia in Manila Bay.
Extensive monitoring studies will provide important baseline data as rehabilitation
interventions are slowly undertaken. Data from surveys will also be useful in modeling

studies. Modeling studies can help in exploring the formation and disappearance of hypoxia


in relation to stratification, freshwater discharge, and nutrient levels and the linkages
between these factors. The results of these studies will be useful for rehabilitation and

management programs for the bay.

3. Chapter 3: Hydrodynamic and water quality modeling of
hypoxia in Manila Bay, Philippines


ABSTRACT

Manila Bay, a marine pollution hotspot, has issues on harmful algal blooms, declining water
quality, and excess organic loads. Field surveys showed evidence of hypoxia and
eutrophication in the bay with low dissolved oxygen and high nutrient levels during the wet
season when the water column was stratified. To explore factors affecting oxygen in the bay,
a hydrodynamic and water quality model was developed with freshwater discharges, NHa,

dissolved oxygen, and CBODS concentrations from major rivers as the main input.

The model reproduced the stratification observed during the wet season field surveys as
well as the depth of the pycnocline between 5-15 meters. Stratification forms and dissipates
in “10-15 days. The water levels produced by the model were consistent with the water
levels from tide gauges and the profiles for salinity and temperature were similar

to the field surveys.

The general distribution of surface dissolved oxygen with lower values near the coasts of
Pampanga, Bulacan, and Pasig (northern and eastern coasts) was reproduced as well as the
formation of low dissolved oxygen in the near-bottom layers. However, the low near-bottom
DO was not specific to the wet season model runs. Low near-bottom DO and hypoxia in
some areas extend into the dry-season model runs. A comparison of DO levels between the
wet and dry season runs shows higher DO levels during the dry season throughout most of

the water column and the bay which was consistent with data from the field surveys.

Loading from the rivers was more relevant, initially, at the surface and affected the water
column up to about 10 meters. Sediment oxygen demand is relevant for the modeled system
for the near-bottom and parts of the water column below the pycnocline. Loading from the
rivers affects the system in less than a week while adjusting the sediment oxygen demand
affects the system in about 14 days. Boundary conditions were important for improving the

water quality of the bay.


The model showed that deoxygenation of the bay is not a permanent feature and can be
alleviated with less loading from rivers as well as lower sediment oxygen demand. The
seasonality of near-bottom hypoxia was not resolved, but the model was able to highlight or

reiterate the relationship of stratification with deoxygenation or decreased DO levels.

Efforts to improve the water quality in Manila Bay by reducing the organic and nutrient
loading from rivers may only be relevant to DO levels, initially, at the surface and upper
water layers. The importance of sediment oxygen demand shown in the model points to the
possible time lag of the effects of efforts to clean up the bay due to residual SOD (from old
sediments). However, DO/hypoxia clears up in the near-bottom waters in about 2 weeks
with lower SOD which means that the feature may not be permanent in Manila Bay.

However, hypoxia is likely a recurring phenomenon as seen in field surveys.


3.1 Introduction

Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an important aspect of the marine ecosystem essential for
sustaining most marine life. Hypoxia occurs when DO levels fall below 2 mg I” {g m*] (or
~30% saturation). At these oxygen levels, animals generally begin to feel the effects of
suffocation (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008). DO levels of at least 5.0 g m’ are required for most
aquatic organisms, such as fishes to survive (Bozorg-Haddad et al., 2021). Low DO
concentrations in a marine ecosystem are often an indicator of poor water quality. Excess
nutrients from land, in the process of eutrophication, cause an increase in primary
production, which in turn promotes the accumulation of organic matter in a system. This
excess organic matter, upon decomposition, contributes to deoxygenation and promotes
hypoxia (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008; Nixon, 1995; Rabalais et al., 2009). Hypoxia can develop
and subsequently be maintained by water column stratification which prevents the vertical

diffusion of oxygen from the upper to the lower layers (Rabalais et al., 2001).

Manila Bay is considered one of the finest harbors in Southeast Asia that connects the
Philippines with its neighboring countries for commerce and trade (Jacinto et al., 2006a). It is
in the southwestern part of Luzon Island in the Philippines serving as a major port and
source of livelihood for many coastal communities along its 190 km coastline (PEMSEA and
MBEMP-MBIN, 2007). It has a 19,720 km? catchment area populated by 31 million people,
or 34% of the total population of the Philippines in 2010 which increased to 38.5 million
people or 38% of the total population in 2015. In 2020, the population in the catchment area

was 48.7 M (BSWM, 2012; NSO, 2010; Philippine Statistics Authority, 2023).

Unfortunately, the bay has been identified as a marine pollution hotspot in the seas of East
Asia by PEMSEA with pollution issues like harmful algal blooms, persistent red tides, heavy
metal pollution, and excess organic loads (Azanza et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2009; Jacinto et
al., 2006b; PEMSEA and MBEMP, 2007; Prudente et al., 1994; Reichardt et al., 2006).
Hypoxia and eutrophication have also been observed in Manila Bay, with near-bottom DO
levels in the bay falling to 1 mg I (June 2008) and nutrient levels exceeding the ASEAN
water quality criteria (Chang et al., 2009; Jacinto et al., 2006b).

More recent studies by the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRD!)
and UP MSI also reported the occurrence of deoxygenation and hypoxia in the bay (Jacinto

et al., 2011; Sotto et al., 2014; Sy et al., 2016). Surveys done during the wet season

consistently showed evidence of stratification and hypoxia (which was often more severe
during the wet season). Minimal improvement over time was observed throughout the
seasonal/annual surveys. In September 2015, conditions seemed to have improved with the
near-bottom bay-wide average reaching 4.46 mg I? (Sy et al., 2016). Data from a 2019 field
survey shows DO < 5.0 mg |? for stations in the middle of the bay at 10-25 m with an
oxycline at less than 10 m which is shallower than previous surveys

(Tolentino and Onda, 2019).

Fisheries and aquaculture are major sources of livelihood (PEMSEA and MBEMP-MBIN,
2007), and they can be adversely affected by the occurrence of hypoxia. At its worst, hypoxia
can cause mass mortality of fish and invertebrates and lead to the formation of dead zones
where very little marine life can survive. It can also cause major shifts in community
structure and production of the entire ecosystem (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008). It can
decrease species diversity and render ecosystems less resilient to changing conditions (Baird
et al., 2004; Bishop et al., 2006).

In Manila Bay, the pollution load problem is aggravated by the fact that in the Philippines,
more than 20 million people have no access to proper sanitation, with less than 10% of the
total population connected to piped sewage and an estimated 250,000 tons of Biochemical
Oxygen Demand (80D)/year organic load into the bay (Olchondra, 2011; PEMSEA and
MBEMP-MBIN, 2007). About 7.1% of the population in the Manila Bay region (watershed)
have sewer connections and about 27% of the wastewater generated

is treated (NEDA, 2020).

In Metro Manila, about 20% of the population has sewerage services but only 8% has access
to wastewater treatment (up to secondary treatment) (GEF, 2005). Generally, industrial and
commercial wastewater is discharged with very little or no treatment, and most of the

waterways in Metro Manila are heavily contaminated.

Residential sewage constitutes about 65-75% of pollution in Metro Manila while the rest
comes from industries and solid waste dumped into drainage systems or rivers and coastal
areas. In effect, most of the wastewater that drains out into the bay contains untreated

sewage. Practically all the sewage is discharged without treatment.


The Pasig River Basin, a sub-basin of the Manila Bay watershed, delivers about 21% of the
organic pollution load, and nearly 82% of the total sewage generated in Manila City is
discharged without any treatment through an outfall in Manila Bay (GEF, 2005). Pampanga
River contributes about 49% of the net freshwater influx while Pasig River contributes about
21%; the remaining 26% comes from the other minor rivers while 4% comes from
precipitation (Jacinto et al., 2006a). The bay has a surface area of 1,700 km?, an average
depth of 17 m, and an approximate volume of 2.98 x 10" m?

(Jacinto, Velasquez, et al., 2006).

This study aims to improve our understanding of the dynamics of hypoxia and
eutrophication in Manila Bay, Philippines through hydrodynamic and water quality modeling
during the wet and dry seasons, and possible remediation. As a follow-up of field studies
investigating hypoxia and eutrophication in Manila Bay (Jacinto et al., 2011; Sotto et al.,
2014), in this study, we used a model to investigate the dynamics of the formation of
hypoxia in Manila Bay with respect to two parts/processes: hydrodynamics and water
quality. The main seasonal variation is the amount of freshwater discharge into the bay,
along with the corresponding nutrient and waste loads. Aside from that, the response of the
oxygen in the bay was investigated using scenarios that varied river loading and

sediment oxygen demand.

3.2 Methodology

3.2.1 General

Field surveys at Manila Bay revealed subsurface and near-bottom water deoxygenation
alongside water column stratification (Jacinto et al., 2011; Sotto et al., 2014; Sy et al., 2016).
To investigate the primary factors affecting dissolved oxygen dynamics in Manila Bay, a
hydrodynamic and water quality model was developed using open-source software Delft3D-
Flow and Delft3D-WAQ, respectively (developed by Deltares). These models were designed

to simulate three-dimensional flow coupled with water quality processes.

The hydrodynamic model simulates non-steady flow and transport phenomena using tidal
and meteorological forcing on a curvilinear, boundary-fitted grid. Delft3D-WAQ uses

numerical simulations for various physical and biogeochemical processes that affect water


quality. It solves the advection-diffusion-reaction equation for a predefined computational

grid and other model substances (Deltares Systems, 2014).

To model two major hydrodynamic scenarios (wet season: June-November, dry season:
December-May), the model inputs for river discharge, wind regimes, heat flux, and rainfall
were adjusted accordingly, as well as the effects of nutrient and organic matter loading from
rivers, CBODS and NHs values from rivers. Details about the parameters considered are

discussed in the following sections.

3.2.2 Domain Description

3.2.2.1 Grid

The model was employed in the spherical coordinate system with 271 and 130 grid indices
to the east and north, respectively, in a curvilinear grid. The grid size ranges from 0.07 to
0.10 km? with one open boundary facing southwest into the West Philippine Sea (aka the
South China Sea).

A total of 16 sigma (topography following) layers (Table 3.1) were identified with a depth
distribution based on the salinity profiles of stations in the middle and at the mouth of the
bay (Figure 3.1). The surface and bottom layers, as well as the middle of the water column,
which often displays stratification, were assigned more layers (thinner, more detailed) to

resolve the processes in these areas better.

3.2.2.3 Bathymetry
Bathymetric data from various field surveys (DHI surveys, NAMRIA, MSI field surveys) were
interpolated using triangular interpolation, internal diffusion, and smoothing into the

computational grid (Figure 3.2).

3.2.2.4 Timeframe
The hydrodynamic model was set up to run for a total of 6 months (182 days) with a time

step of 5 minutes. The results were compiled every hour.

3.2.2.5 Initial Conditions
Uniform initial conditions were used for the wet season run with a water level of 0 meters, a
salinity of 34 PSU, and a temperature of 27.5°C. A restart file representing the last time step

from the wet season model run was used as an initial file for the dry season model run.

3.2.3 Physical Processes and Meteorological Forcing

The hydrodynamic processes include salinity, temperature, wind, tides, heat flux, and river
discharge. River discharge, wind regime, solar radiation, and rainfall were adjusted

accordingly to simulate the different seasons (wet season or dry season).

The model has one open boundary facing southwest to the West Philippine Sea (South China
Sea). The tidal parameters K:, Ox, Ps, Qu (diurnal) and Mz, Sz, Nz, Kz (semi-diurnal modes) for
the two endpoints of the boundary were downloaded from the DELFT Dashboard based on
the domain of the study. The boundary conditions for salinity and temperature were based

on CTD profiles from stations at the bay’s mouth.

3.2.3.2. Wind, precipitation, evaporation, and heat flux model

Daily average wind velocity and direction, average precipitation, and temperature were
taken from the PAGASA Port Area meteorological station for the year 2012. When needed,
the model computes evaporation internally for the heat balance using the Murakami heat
flux model (used for Japanese waters with humidity, air temperature, and net solar radiation
prescribed) (Murakami et al., 1985). Monthly solar radiation was obtained from a point in

the middle of Manila Bay from the SOLARGIS database.

The baseline year used in the meteorological inputs for the model was 2011 and 2012. The
dry season run inputs were from December 2010 to May 2011 and the wet season run
inputs were from June 2012 to November 2012. Two field surveys were conducted during

those time frames (February 2011 for the dry season and August 2012 for the wet season).

3.2.3.3 River Discharge and loading

The discharge from 11 rivers represents the freshwater input at the mouths of each river
(Figure 3.3) into the hydrodynamic model. This includes the major rivers, Pampanga and
Pasig, which together contribute 70% of the net freshwater influx into Manila Bay (Jacinto et
al., 2006a). The 11 rivers identified in the model contribute a total discharge of 25.72 km? y",

draining a total area of 17,886.50 km? consistent with literature data.


The discharge for each river was distributed evenly until the k-th sigma layer based on the
depth of each river mouth. Pampanga River was assigned to two discharge points
(corresponding to two grid cells) to accommodate its wider river mouth and higher average

discharge. Full details on each river discharge point are given in Appendices 3.1 and 3.2.

‘The average discharge rate (Qu) for each river was taken from published data from various
references (Appendix 3.2). The total average freshwater discharge is 815.67 m?s. Double
the average annual discharge rate was used for the wet season runs (total of 1631.34 m?s*),
while half the average annual discharge rate was used for the dry season runs (total of

406.84 m?s). The model receives a constant discharge from the rivers throughout the
whole wet or dry season run (after a spin-up of ~1 month).

The general dissolved oxygen model module from DELFT Water Quality (DELWAQ) (Deltares,
2014) was used to build the water quality model for Manila Bay (Figure 3.4). It simulates the
decay of organic matter, nitrification of ammonium, and replenishment of dissolved oxygen

through reaeration. Details of the processes can be found in the Deltares Water Quality User

Manual. The water quality model runs done in this study are summarized in Table 3.2.

The major parameters involved are dissolved oxygen (DO), carbonaceous biochemical
‘oxygen demand (CBODS), and ammonium (NH). The major processes include the
mineralization of BOD (oxygen sink), reaeration (oxygen sink and source), nitrification

(oxygen sink), and sediment oxygen demand (oxygen sink).

Ammonium is used in the model in the process of nitrification. Nitrification is the conversion
of ammonium to nitrate which uses up oxygen (the process is oxidation). Itis a linear
process that is dependent on temperature and oxygen. Ammonium is an input to the model
via loading through rivers. In Manila Bay, the sources of ammonium from the watershed
include domestic (untreated sewage), agriculture (mineral fertilizer), and industrial waste.
From the nutrient analysis conducted during the field surveys, ammonium is, on average,
about 50% of the total inorganic nitrogen concentration in the bay. Elevated ammonium
levels are a symptom of eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. Nitrification is assumed to be
the most relevant process in terms of the nitrogen cycle in the factors affecting oxygen
dynamics in the current model. In the Manila Bay system in particular, nitrification is
considered relevant due to the elevated levels of both ammonium and nitrate as observed

from field data.

Reaeration is a first-order process based on the oxygen deficit, wind speed, salinity, and
water depth. Wind speed and salinity are input parameters and depend on local conditions,

while the water depth is determined by the hydrodynamic model.

Carbonaceous BOD (CBODS) represents the oxygen-demanding equivalent of complex
carbonaceous material found in waste (mineralization of organic matter). In Manila Bay,
organic matter is from untreated sewage from domestic, industrial, and agricultural
activities and increased nutrient loads from rivers that stimulate primary production. CBODS

is subject to a linear decay process dependent on temperature and oxygen.

Sediment oxygen _The wet season model run was used as the base input. Effect of lower sediment
demand scenario Sediment oxygen demand was set to fS0D=0.25 for the oxygen demand on the
lower SOD runs. dissolved oxygen levels in the
bay.

Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) is an additional oxygen consumption parameter in the
model coming from the sediment where degradation continues on organic matter that has
settled. This process can only proceed under aerobic conditions in the water column
(overlying water). A uniform SOD is applied to the whole grid in the model and adjusted

according to the loading scenario.

The model used the standard substance module, “general dissolved oxygen model” from the
Delft3D Water Quality Modeling software developed by Deltares. Some aspects of the
processes or substances involving the flux of dissolved oxygen and the aspect of

eutrophication are assumed or lumped into the other variables used.

For example, there are no processes involving algae that can also use up oxygen during
photosynthesis. It is represented instead in the organic matter fraction (CBOD) as oxygen

demand. Other nutrients and organic matter are assumed to be negligible compared to the

amount of waste and loading the bay receives from domestic and agricultural acti

The choice of the model is based on several considerations:

1. The main objective of the study is to look at broad seasonal and spatial trends

resulting from major pollution sources (anthropogenic nutrient and organic matter

loading) in Manila Bay.


2. The minimum substances and processes required to model dissolved oxygen were
used to lessen the assumptions for unavailable inputs, flux, and process rates.
3. Limited data is available for river discharge and concentrations which is used as

input and for comparison in the model.

3.2.4.2 Initial and Boundary Conditions

The water quality model runs were initialized with a dissolved oxygen value of 6.0 g m?, a
CBODS value of 3.0 g m, and an NH; value of 0.05 g m? for the whole bay. At the open
boundary, the depth profiles for each parameter were patterned after the field survey data

from the station closest to the bay’s mouth.

3.2.4.3. Loading from Rivers

The dissolved oxygen (DO), carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBODS), and
ammonium (NHs) loadings from rivers were obtained from various monitoring datasets (e.g.,
PEMSEA, BSWM, and MBCO). Wet season and dry season concentrations from river
monitoring data were used as input in the water quality model (Table 3.3). There were no
significant differences in the average concentrations for NH« and CBODS, as well as DO levels
between the wet and dry season inputs. The main difference came from the corresponding

river discharges per run.

3.2.4.4 Loading and Sediment Oxygen Demand Scenarios
Pollution loading scenarios were simulated by increasing or decreasing the amount of
CBODS and NH, concentrations in rivers. The levels of DO in the river discharges were also

adjusted accordingly (Table 3.4).

The sediment oxygen demand was adjusted (increased or decreased) through time to
investigate the effects on dissolved oxygen concentrations in the bay. Decreased sediment

oxygen demand represents the long-term effects of decreased pollution loading in Manila


Bay. The loading from rivers was kept constant for this experiment. The baseline SOD value
used for this study was 1.0 g 0, m?-day which is the approximate average of the oxygen
uptake studies for coastal and shallow water areas as well as select rivers in Manila Bay
(Appendix 3.3). Sediment oxygen uptake studies in estuaries affected by deoxygenation and
eutrophication showed rates that reached up to 2.6 g 02 m?-day at Narraganset Bay where
near-bottom DO levels ranged from 1-3 mg !? (Fulweiler et al. 2010). In Chiangjiang Estuary,
a system where SOD is a major oxygen sink below the pycnocline, SOD ranged from 0.29 -
2.0 g Oam?-day (Zhang et al., 2017).

The depth-interpolated 30-day average velocity profiles (Figure 3.6) show the formation of
gyres at the middle of the bay and at the mouth. Estuarine circulation is observed where the
outflow of water occurs at the surface and subsurface layers. The inflow of denser water
(higher salinity) begins at 14 meters. Generally, there is a relatively stronger inflow at the

western part and a somewhat stronger outflow at the eastern side of the bay’s mouth.


The residual water flow at the surface after 30 days is flowing out of the bay with slight
convergence at the middle near the head of the bay. At 5.33 m, the flow is mostly similar

with an anticyclonic eddy forming at the middle of the bay.

‘At 14.0 m, the flow starts to reverse (inflow) but with the same anticyclonic flow present and
the formation of a few gyres near the mouth of the bay. At 22.6 m, the residual flow is going
into the bay.

During the dry season, the circulation patterns are essentially the same with slightly lower
velocities than during the wet season. A gyre in the middle of the bay is observed at 1 meter.
The residual flow is going into the bay at 5 meters (Appendix 3.4) and reverses (outflow) at
14 meters. The flow at 22.6 meters is going out of the bay.

Stratification index = [average salinity > 10 m] - [average salinity < 10 m}

The salinity range produced by the model at different depths is in good agreement with the
field survey data for the wet and dry seasons (Table 3.5). The August 2012 survey was done
after a huge rain event, so the salinity range is wider compared with the other wet

season surveys.


Stratification of the water column, with the halocline located between 5-10 meters, was
observed throughout the bay. Beginning with a uniform/well-mixed water column,
stratification forms by about day 20 and persists through day 90 and day 180 with a constant
wet season river discharge input into the hydrodynamic model.

Freshwater from the rivers mixes with the saline water and extends out until the mouth of
the bay at the surface. The horizontal salinity gradient at the surface becomes less defined
by day 180 (Figure 3.70).

Figure 3.7. Salinity at Section 1 (EW) for day 90 (A) and day 180 (8) and at Section 2 (NS) for day 90 (C)
and day 180 (D) during the wet season model run. Refer to Figure 3.5 for the cross-section orientation.

In the dry season model run, less pronounced stratification was observed, with salinity
ranging from 32-34 PSU at the EW cross-section (Figures 3.84 and B). Despite the reduced
freshwater influence during the dry season, relatively lower salinity persisted up to
approximately 10 meters into the water column. Minimal variation in salinity distribution
was observed between day 90 and day 180 in Section 1 of the bay.

In Section 2 (Figure 3.8D), the salinity gradient is slightly steeper at day 180 due to the river
discharge at the head of the bay. Salinity in this section ranged from 29-34 PSU.

The temperature ranged from 26-29°C during the wet season model run and became slightly
warmer from day 90 to day 180 at the surface, The temperature distribution is similar in
both cross-sections of the bay (Appendix 3.5).

Figure 3.8. Salinity at Section 1 (EW) for day 90 (A) and day 180 (B) and at Section 2 (NS) for day 90 (C)
and day 180 (D) during the dry season model run. Refer to Figure 3.5 for the cross-section orientation.

‘The temperature during the dry season model run is higher at the surface until 5 meters,
ranging from 28 to 30°C. At greater than 5 meters, the temperature is lower than the wet
season model at 24.5 - 25°C. The temperature increased from day 90 to day 180 at the
surface, with warmer water penetrating a bit deeper into the water column by day 180. The
temperature beyond 5 meters is mostly the same from day 90 to day 180. The temperature
distribution is similar in both cross-sections (Appendix 3.6).

In the wet season, less saline waters (27-28 PSU) penetrated up to 5 meters into the water
column at Section 1 (Figure 3.10A). The salinity gradient at the surface is not seen during the
dry season (Figure 3.108). More saline water (33-34 PSU) is consistently found at about 14
meters onwards. Less saline water (29-30 PSU) reaches the mouth of the bay, indicating the

extent of the influence of river discharge in the system (Figure 3.10C).

During the wet (Figure 3.12) and dry (Figure 3.128) seasons, relatively warmer waters
penetrated up to “5 meters into the water column in Section 1. The temperature during the
dry season at the surface until S meters is warmer than the wet season. The same general

distribution of temperature along Section 2 is observed for both the wet and dry seasons.

3.3.1.4 Formation and dissipation of stratification
Stratification starts in about 20-25 days with a constant wet season river discharge input.

The pycnocline is found between 5-10 meters. Stratification dissipates faster during the dry
season run, after about 15 days (Figure 3.13).

The salinity difference before and after the pycnocline (at about 10 meters) was used as an
index of stratification (Table 3.4). During the wet season field surveys and model runs, the
stratification indices were 1.86, 4.83, 19.09, and 3.75 PSU for July 2010, August 2011, August

2012, and the wet season model run, respectively. During the dry season, the indices were
1.90, 0.25, and 1.75 PSU for February 2010, February 2011, and the model run, respectively.

Figure 3.14. Salinity profiles for the wet (A) and dry (B) seasons and temperature profiles for wet (C)

and dry (D) seasons from field surveys and model runs.

In general, salinity profiles from the model (both wet and dry seasons) were in better

agreement with field survey data than temperature (Figure 3.14). Density profiles closely

resembled salinity for both field and model data. This is expected since Manila Bay is

classified as an estuary and hence salinity has more influence on the density structure

of the system,

1s

Salinity profiles from the model runs for both the wet (Figure 3.14A) and dry seasons (Figure
3.148) were within range of the field survey profiles except for August 2012, when a heavy
rainfall event occurred right before the survey, causing a significant decrease in the salinity
levels of the upper water columns. Stratification was observed during the wet season model
run and field surveys (Figure 3.14A). Salinity values had a wider range at the surface and
were slightly higher at depths greater than 10 meters for the dry season model run when

compared with the field surveys.

The temperature profiles from the wet season model run were most similar to the profiles
from the July 2010 field survey but were generally lower by about ~1°C (Figure 3.14C).

Temperature profiles had a wider distribution range during the wet-season field surveys.

The temperature profiles (Figure 3.14D) from the dry season model run were ~1-2°C higher
in shallow water than the profiles from the field surveys but were within range at depths
greater than 10 meters. Stratification of the temperature profiles was also observed in the
dry season model runs. The vertical salinity gradient and halocline seen between 5-15 m in

the model runs are also present in the field surveys.

Figure 3.15. Density profiles for the wet (A) and dry (B) seasons from field surveys and model runs

In general, density profiles (Figure 3.15) mirrored salinity profiles for both the wet and dry
season runs. The wet season model run had a similar density profile with the field surveys
with a pycnocline between 5-15 m. The dry season model run also had the presence of a

pycnocline, but the density profiles are within a narrower range.

Figure 3.16. Horizontally averaged depth profiles* for salinity (A), temperature (B), density (C), and
Brunt-Vaisala Frequency (D). *All data points at the same depths for each station were averaged. The
result is a representative depth profile for the whole bay for each field survey and model run. The
figures do not include salinity and density profiles for the August 2012 field survey since it was after a
huge freshwater input into the bay (from an intense rainfall event) and hence covered a wider salinity
range.

The horizontally averaged salinity (Figure 3.16A) and density (Figure 3.16C) profiles show
characteristics of estuaries wherein salinity controls the density. Temperature (Figure 3.168)
was found to be quite variable within the field survey profiles, but the temperature profiles
from the wet and dry model runs were within 1-2 degrees of each other. This is expected
since the initial file for the dry season model run is the final output from the wet season

model run.

The temperature at the surface until 10 meters during the dry season is higher than the wet
season model. At depths greater than 10 meters, the temperature during the dry season is
lower and is within the range (<1.0°C) of the February 2010 field survey. Large errors at the
surface are due to the wide range of salinity and temperature values which is controlled by

many factors like river input, heat flux, precipitation, and evaporation at the surface.

The model temperature profiles were similar to field survey profiles but the values are not,
within range (except for Feb 2010 and 2012). The temperature range from the field had a
relatively wide distribution throughout the different surveys. The range of values were not
reproduced by the model, likely because the input temperature value for the river discharge

was not varied; a constant value was assigned for the whole dry and wet season run.

3.3.1.7. Brunt-Vaisala Frequency

The Brunt-Vaisala (BV) frequency measures the stability of a water column or its mixing
potential by calculating the number of oscillations a parcel of water moves vertically along a
density gradient. Higher BV values indicate a more stable water column often coinciding
with the presence of stratification. There is less mixing between water layers that have high

BV values.

Profiles from the dry season field surveys and model runs generally have lower Brunt-Vaisala
frequency values compared with the wet season due to the more stable water column with

less stratification.

The values for the wet season field surveys and model runs are higher, indicating stronger
stratification and hence less mixing and more stability between the water layers.
Brunt-Vaisala values are relatively higher from 10-15 meters, the depth where the

pycnocline is usually observed in Manila Bay. At these depths, there isa strong density


gradient, with temperature and salinity changing abruptly. Beyond 20-30 meters, the BV
values are lower since the water column is more stable, and the density does not vary

too much.

3.3.1.8 Comparison with tide gauge data

Water level from the tide gauge stations and the model runs showed good agreement with
an average correlation of 0.974 across the three tide gauges for the wet season and 0.977
for the dry season (Appendix 3.7 and 3.8).

3.3.1.9 Hydrodynamic Model Summary

The hydrodynamic model for Manila Bay simulated estuarine circulation characterized by
surface outflow and subsurface inflow (14 meters onward). The flow was stronger at the
mouth of the bay compared to the middle and head of the bay. The formation of gyres was
observed and stratification in the model formed and dissipated within a short time frame of
15-20 days.

Salinity profiles from the model were consistent with field survey profiles, their values within
range of each other. The halocline was observed between S-15 meters. Similarly,
temperature profiles from the model resemble field survey profiles although there is a
greater variability in the values (even within the field surveys). Density profiles parallel

salinity with the pycnocline between 5-15 meters.


3.3.2 Water Quality Modeling

Figure 3.17. Modeled dissolved oxygen along Section 1 (EW) in the middle of the bay at 90 days (A)
and 180 days (8) during the wet season. Refer to Figure 3.5 for the cross-section orientation.

Low near-bottom DO forms across the bay during the wet season with a parcel of low DO
water accumulating at the eastern side of the bay at the upper 5 meters (Figure 3.17A). The
formation of low near-bottom DO takes about 30 days once the model spins up. Water

column DO at this midsection ranged from 5.5-6.0 gm. DO decreased slightly from day 90

to day 180 at Section 1. The results are summarized in Table 3.6 below.

Figure 3.18. Modeled dissolved oxygen along Section 2 (NS) at the middle of the bay at 90 days (A) and

At the NS cross-section (Section 2; Figure 3.18), low near-bottom DO forms along the bay,
with relatively lower DO found near the head of the bay in shallower areas. Water column
DO at Section 2 ranged from 5.5-6.0 g m®. DO decreased slightly from day 90 to day 180 in

Section 2. Table 3.7 summarizes the results in section 1.

Ammonium is relevant at the surface since it is sourced from rivers. It is negligible at the

the eastern side of the bay is also present. At section 2 along the bay, NHs is higher near the

mouth of the bay. There isa slight increase in NHa levels from day 90 to day 180 (Appendix

3.9 and 3.10).

Carbonaceous Biochemical Oxygen Demand over 5 days (CBODS)

CBODS is mostly low throughout the bay except for the surface and near rivers. The same
general distribution was observed wherein accumulation on the eastern side of the bay was
found (Section 1, Appendix 3.11). A slight increase in levels was observed from day 90 to day

180 and CBODS values were higher at the mouth of the bay at section 2 (Appendix 3.12).

Relatively higher NHa and CBODS levels at the surface coincide with low DO levels at the

eastern side of the bay at Section 1 and near the mouth of the bay at Section 2.

Generally, higher bay-wide DO was observed at 90 and 180 days for the dry season
compared with the wet season model run. Bay-wide DO at the middle section (Figure 3.19)
during the dry season ranged from 5-6.5 g m?. Near-bottom DO across the middle of the bay
is relatively low (~4-5.0 g m*) but is slightly better compared with the wet season run. A thin
band of hypoxic water (<2 g m*) near the bottom in the shallow waters along the coasts is
observed at the western and eastern sides of the bay. The results are summarized in

In Section 2, higher bay-wide DO (Figure 3.20) was observed in general at 90 and 180 days
during the dry season model run compared with the wet season model run, ranging from
5.5-6.5 gm. The low DO (<2-5 g m®) near the bottom of the bay improves by day 180 but a
band of hypoxic (D0 <2 g m*) water remains near the head of the bay at the NS cross-
section. The low DO at the surface of the bay was not observed during the dry season run
due to less freshwater discharge from the rivers. During the dry season, DO levels in the bay

improve by 0.5-1.0 gm? through time. Table 3.7 summarizes the results in section 2.

CBODS and NH,

Seasonal averages of NH, and CBOD5

Seasonal averages of NHa (Figure 3.21) and CBODS (Appendix 3.13) were generally low

throughout the surface and near the bottom of the bay. At 1 meter, NHq and CBOD have the

same seasonal distribution for both the wet and dry seasons with the highest levels near the

rivers, specifically, Pasig River on the eastern coast between Manila and Cavite. This general

distribution is consistent with the field surveys in February 2011 and August 2012. Dry

season levels were lower for both NHg and CBOD in the model compared with the wet

season due to decreased river discharge and therefore, loading. Near the bottom, NHq and

CBOD are relatively higher at the shallow water areas at the head of the bay near the rivers

(Pasig, Pampanga, Angat).

Ammonium distribution was similar to the field survey in July 2010, with relatively higher

levels along the northeastern coast. The surface and bottom levels of NHa produced by the

model are within range of the values observed during the field surveys.

are plots of values at the last layer of the model (near the bottom), so the bathymetry varies
throughout the whole grid for these two plots.

The CBOD distribution is similar to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) distribution found
during the field surveys (wet season, Aug. 2011 and 2012) where relatively higher levels are

found along the coast (near the rivers) at the head of the bay at the surface and near the
bottom. Both CBOD and DOC can represent the amount of organic matter in the system.

Almost negligible levels of NH4 and CBODS were observed at the water column and near the
bottom. In general, dry season levels are a bit lower compared with the wet season. At the
surface, higher levels of NH4 and CBODS were found at the eastern part of the bay (along
Section 1) for both the wet and dry seasons (Appendix 3.14 A and B and 3.15 A and B).

Along the bay at Section 2 (Appendix 3.14 C and D), higher levels of NH were found near
the mouth. For CBODS, levels are mostly high throughout the surface of the bay at both
Sections 1 and 2 (Appendix 3.15) as well as near the head of the bay.

Figures C and D ore plots of dissolved oxygen at the last layer of the model (near the bottom), so the
bathymetry varies throughout the whole grid for these two plots.

The 30-day average for dissolved oxygen at 1 m for the wet season (Figure 3.22A) shows DO
levels < 5.0 gm? (blues) at the shallow areas along the head of the bay and along the
eastern coast. The lowest DO levels, ~ 2.0-3.0 g m? are found near the mouth of Pasig River.


The accumulation of water with relatively low DO on the eastern coast is due to shallow

bathymetry in the area and substantial river input.

‘Average DO levels at 1m during the dry season (Figure 3.228) show relatively the same trend
but the parcel of low DO water near the head of the bay (D0 < 5.0 g m*) covers a smaller
area. The areas near the mouths of the Pasig and Pampanga Rivers still have the relatively
lowest DO levels at 1 m (~2.0-3.0 gm").

Dissolved oxygen levels near the bottom of the bay for the wet and dry seasons (Figure
3.22C and D) shows a similar distribution. Shallow water and areas with substantial river
input at the head of the bay and along the eastern coast had low DO levels (<5.0 ¢ m*).

Figure 3.23. Average dissolved oxygen concentration for the last thirty (30 days) of the corresponding
water quality model runs. Dissolved oxygen (DO) for Section 1 (across the bay) during the wet (A) and
dry season (8) and Section 2 (along the bay) for the wet (C) and dry (D) seasons. Refer to Figure 3.5 for
the section orientations.

The water column DO is generally better during the dry season but the band of low DO
water at the bottom across the bay (Section 1, Figure 3.23A and B) is present during both

the wet and dry seasons. Dry season DO levels are generally better by about 1.0-1.5 gm?


compared with the wet season. Shallow areas near rivers have the lowest near-bottom DO

levels for both the wet and dry seasons.

3.3.2.4 Comparison with field surveys

The surface distribution of DO found in a recent 2020 field survey by NEDA was in good
agreement with the model results (Figure 3.22A). The low DO areas (<5 g m*) along the
eastern coast (Cavite side) and at the shallow areas at the head of the bay (northern coast)

were also observed in the field surveys (NEDA, 2020b).

Figure 3.24, Dissolved oxygen concentration from wet season field surveys across Section 1 at the
middle of the bay during (A) July 2010 and (8) August 2011. The unit mg/l is equivalent to g/m3. Refer
to Figure 3.5 for the transect/section orientation.

The low near-bottom DO along Section 1 at the middle of the bay seen in the wet season
model runs was also observed during the field surveys conducted during the wet season
(«3.5 g m*) (Figure 3.24), The DO for the rest of the water column during the field surveys is

about 5.0-6.5 g m®, consistent with the model results.

Low near-bottom DO (<4.0 gm’) near the head of the bay observed during the field surveys
was also observed in the wet season model runs. DO for the rest of the bay at Section 2 (NS)
ranged from 5.0-7.0 g m® similar to the wet season model run (Appendix 3.16). However,

the high DO at the surface observed during the August 2011 field survey was not resolved in
the model. DO at the surface during the July 2010 field survey was similar to the wet season

model run.

Water column DO at the midsection of the bay (Section 1) during the dry season field
surveys ranged from 6-8 g m® which is higher than the results from the dry season model
runs (5.0-6.5 gm).

A band of low DO near the bottom (<2. m) was observed during the February 2010 field
survey which was also observed in the model. During the February 2011 field survey, this
hypoxic near-bottom DO was not observed but there is a patch of low DO water near the

bottom at the eastern side of the bay, similar to the model runs.

Water column DO during the dry season field surveys ranged from 6.0-8.0 gm? which is
higher than the dry season model range (5.5-6.5 g m*). The dry season model results were
closer to the February 2011 field survey results in terms of the DO levels for the whole bay
(6.0-6.5 gm’) (Appendix 3.16).

The band of low DO water (DO 2.0-4.0 mg I") near the bottom of the bay for Section 2 was
only found in the middle of the bay during the field surveys. DO at the shallow areas at the
head of the bay during the field surveys was higher (> 6.0 g m”). In the dry season model
un, the band of low DO water covered most of Section 2 along the bottom of the bay
starting at the shallow areas at the head (Appendix 3.18).

The distribution of DO observed from the field surveys where water with DO levels below
5.0 g m® tends to occur near the bottom and at the shallow areas along the coasts near

rivers was reproduced by the model runs.

The average DO profile from the model runs is lower at the surface and higher at 10 m

onwards compared with the field surveys (Figure 3.25).

3.3.2.5 Loading scenarios

Figure 3.26. Modeled dissolved oxygen across Section 1 at the middle of the bay 90 days ofter loading
from rivers is increased by twice the average amount and 90 days after the loading is decreased by
half the average amount. Refer to Figure 3.5 for the section orientation.

During the baseline run, low DO from rivers reached up to ~5 meters into the water column
with the low DO at the bottom layers (1.0-4.0 g m) becoming consistent from day 30
onwards. There is also entrainment of low DO at the eastern side of the bay at the

surface (Figure 3.26A).

Upon increased loading, lower DO levels from the rivers reached up to almost 10 meters into
the water column. The low DO at the bottom layers is consistent (1.0-4.0 gm), and the

entrainment of low DO water is still present at the eastern side of the bay.


After decreased loading, the DO at the surface improves but the low DO at the bottom

layers is still present though at slightly better levels (Figure 3.26B).

Figure 3.27. Modeled dissolved oxygen across Section 2 at the middle of the bay 90 days after loading
from rivers is increased by twice the average amount and 90 days after the loading is decreased by
half the average amount. Refer to Figure 3.5 for the section orientation.

The same is seen along Section 2 (Figure 3.27). The decreased loading from rivers becomes
more relevant for the DO levels at the surface. Relatively low DO at the bottom layers is

almost the same even with decreased loading from the rivers.

Results from the loading scenarios show that at the head of the bay, DO in the shallow water
areas is affected in less than 5 days after loading and is increased to twice as much (Figure
3.28). Surface DO and DO until about 10 meters into the water column at the middle of the

bay is affected by increased loading.

DO at the surface and water column at the head of the bay improves with decreased loading
but the low DO near the bottom persists. Improvement in the surface and water column DO
levels is seen with decreased loading in the middle of the bay. Low near-bottom DO at the
head and middle of the bay persists despite decreased loading. The change in DO
is™~+1.0-1.5 gm.

DO levels improved after 14 days at the bay's head, throughout the water column, and at
the bottom due to decreased sediment oxygen demand (Figure 3.29). Low near-bottom DO
clears up in the middle of the bay after decreased sediment oxygen demand. DO levels at
the rest of the water column also improve. Near the mouth, surface DO levels improve with

decreased sediment oxygen demand.

Most of the water column is affected near the mouth. At the middle of the bay, near-bottom

proximity of the station to the shallow water areas with significant river influence). The
change in DO levels is ~ + 1.0- 2.0 gm.

Loading from rivers is relevant at the surface, initially, but also affects the rest of the water

column until ~10-14 meters where DO decreases with increased loading, or where DO
increases with decreasing loading. DO levels for the rest of the water column and near the

bottom are affected by increasing or decreasing sediment oxygen demand. Sediment oxygen

demand also seems to be more relevant for DO levels beyond the pycnocline.


3.4 Discussion

3.4.1 Deoxygenation and eutrophication in coastal environments

The consumption of oxygen beyond an ecosystem’s oxygen regeneration capacity leads to
the occurrence of hypoxia; this process can be triggered by a combination of several factors.
In most estuarine and coastal systems affected by hypoxia (or deoxygenation), critical
factors include temperature, nutrient input, stratification, and water circulation. However,
the relative importance of these factors to oxygen levels and the occurrence of hypoxia is
quite varied among different estuaries and coastal areas (Qian et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017;
Qian et al., 2022).

In addition, activities in bays and within its watersheds are also factors that can promote
hypoxia and eutrophication. These include agricultural, domestic, and industrial activities
that generate waste which can end up in the bay through rivers. Aquaculture activities in

coastal areas are also a source of organic matter input.

In Manila Bay, there is increased nutrient and organic matter input from untreated sewage
from densely populated areas as well as heavy agricultural activities in the watershed. In
fact, Manila Bay drains a watershed which has a population of 48.7 million people (2020
Philippine Statistics Authority). Overpopulation in cities near the shore is a problem as the
majority of waste from these households (e.g., informal settlers) drains directly into the
rivers and the bay without any treatment. The bay also receives a significant amount of
freshwater discharge (25 km? y") from its rivers (Jacinto et al., 2006). Stratification of the
water column due to density/salinity differences occurs in the bay, especially during the

rainy season (June to November) (Sotto et al., 2014; Jacinto et al., 2011).

In water bodies that drain large rivers in areas with extensive anthropogenic activities,
hypoxia is often seen as a consequence of increased nutrient inputs. Examples of these
systems include the Gulf of Mexico, Chesapeake Bay, Pearl River Estuary, and Yangtze River
Estuary (Gilbert et al. 2010, Rabalais et al. 2014, Breitburg et al. 2018).

The rivers draining into Manila Bay receive inputs from industry, agriculture, aquaculture,

and domestic sewage that is largely untreated. Pasig and Pampanga Rivers, which contribute

70% of the freshwater influx into the bay flush out the waste from the overpopulated City of

Manila which has a population of 1.44 million (2020 PSA) and areas with heavy agriculture
and aquaculture activities, respectively. In 2012, Metro Manila only had 20% of its
population connected to sewerage services with 8% of that treated only up to secondary
treatment (Implementation Status and Results: Manila Third Sewarage Project, 2012; GEF,
2005). Wastewater treatment has since increased to 14.5% in 2019. Plans for the
improvement of sewage treatment in the city are underway but these do not yet include the
treatment of sewage up to tertiary treatment level to address the excess nutrient input

(Balinbin, 2021).

3.4.2 General Features of Circulation

Modeled residual water flow (over 30 days) shows that freshwater in the bay flows out at
the surface while seawater flows in at the bottom, characteristic of estuarine circulation.
Water flow at the mouth of the bay is generally stronger. The formation of gyres was also
evident from the results of the model. Residual flow during the dry season was lower than in

the wet season.

A circulation study by Villanoy and Martin (1997) also found stronger water flow at the bay's
mouth dominated by tidal forcing. A clockwise circulation near the surface during the wet
season and estuarine flow were also evident in the results of the hydrodynamic model by
the NHRC (2021). Lower residual currents during the dry season were also produced

in their model.

Estuarine circulation, which can affect the mixing or stability of the water column, has an
impact on the water quality of bays and estuaries. River input affects the amount of
nutrients and pollutants coming in from the land. In addition, significant freshwater
discharge can result in stratification that prevents the reaeration of sub-surface and

bottom waters.

Estuaries with narrow entrances tend to be more stratified. Narrow entrances in bays
restrict the mixing of saltwater and freshwater affecting flow and the formation of
stratification (Wolanski and Elliot, 2016). In Manila Bay, the width at the mouth is ~22 km
and the basin is ~50-60 km at its widest points near the head of the bay (Jacinto et al.,
2006a; Google Earth Pro). Other estuarine systems such as the Chesapeake Bay also have

narrow entrances (27 km entrance, 50 km at its widest point).

The salinity range produced by the models for both the wet and dry season runs was in good
agreement with the field survey data. The pycnocline (halocline) observed in the wet season
model run was found between 5-15 meters, similar to the wet season field surveys. The wet
season model run had a higher stratification index compared with the dry season model run.
Salinity was lower near the coast and at the surface of the bay for both wet and dry season
model runs. Temperature was higher at the surface, near the coast, and in shallower areas

of the bay.

For both the wet and dry seasons, fresher water tends to aggregate at the northern and
western parts of the coast (near Pasac and Pampanga Rivers and along the coast of Bataan).

The same distribution is seen from the field surveys, especially during the wet season.

3.4.3 Stratification and Oxygen levels

In the model, stratification forms in ~20-25 days with increased freshwater discharge during
the wet season and dissipates in ~10-15 days with decreased freshwater discharge during
the dry season. Low near-bottom DO and bottom hypoxia at the shallow areas were
observed for both wet and dry season model runs, DO near the bottom decreases after
about 10-15 days during the model runs. The dissolved oxygen levels for the rest of the

water column are higher during the dry season when stratification is less intense.

Stratification persists in the model for as long as the freshwater discharge input is twice the
annual average, representing the rainy season. Stratification dissipates once the discharge
starts to decrease to half the annual average. During the field surveys, stratification was
present throughout the wet season surveys. Low DO in the water column persists during the

wet season and increased loading model runs.

In other seasonally stratified systems, stratification is prompted by the summer season
wherein the waters are warmer. In Jinhae Bay in Korea, stratification reformed about a week
after a strong typhoon event along with the recurrence of bottom hypoxia (Lee et al., 2018).
In the Texas-Louisiana shelf system, a long duration of stratification over the shelf defines an
area wherein bottom hypoxia occurs with high probability. The occurrence of persistent
stratification depletes oxygen in the water column, allowing the hypoxic layer to thicken
(Zhang et al., 2020).


Stratification has often been associated with deoxygenation because it prevents the vertical
transfer of dissolved oxygen from the upper to the bottom water layers across the

pycnocline. It is recognized as a crucial condition for hypoxia to occur in most estuaries and
coastal ecosystems (Qian et al., 2022). In Victoria Bay, an urban harbor in Hong Kong, which
is also part of the Pearl River Estuary, the hypoxic zone in the near-bottom waters expanded

during periods of low tidal mixing and strong stratification (Lu et al., 2022).

Salinity and density profiles from both field surveys and mode! runs show that below the
pycnocline at ~10-15 meters, dissolved oxygen is mostly < 5.0 g/m}. Brunt-Vaisala Frequency
values (N) are also relatively higher at these depths where there is a strong density gradient
with temperature and salinity changing rapidly with depth. Higher N values indicate stronger
stratification and hence less mixing and chances for reaeration of the bottom water layers.
In general, N values for the dry season field surveys and model run are lower indicating less

stratification of the water column.

Low water column DO and bottom hypoxia were observed during the wet season field
surveys in Manila Bay coinciding with the presence of stratification. Low oxygen levels
frequently affected the areas in the middle of the bay and close to the coast (Jacinto et al.,
2011; Sotto et al., 2014; Sy et al., 2016).

In the Changjiang Estuary, hypoxia and low DO occurred in the presence of a pycnocline
which was found to play an important role in preserving hypoxic conditions in the area.
During periods of low river discharge and a low-density gradient, hypoxia was not observed
in the area (Zhu et al., 2016).

3.4.4 Water Quality Modeling

Seasonal differences in water quality were investigated in the water quality model. The wet
season model run had high freshwater discharge from rivers (total of 1631.34 m?s*) while
the dry season run had less freshwater discharge (total of 406.84 m?s). In addition, a
scenario wherein a significant increase or decrease in river loading was simulated using the
water quality model. Lastly, a scenario with higher and lower sediment oxygen demand was

3.4.5. Dissolved oxygen distribution

With constant wet season river discharge and loading, DO in the water column does not
improve much with time. From day 90 to day 180, DO is about 0.5-1.0 g m? lower
throughout the water column. During the dry season, DO in the water column is generally
higher by 1.0-2.5 g m® and improves from day 90 to day 180 in the model runs.

In the Pearl River Estuary, changes in dissolved oxygen levels have been linked to factors
such as freshwater discharge in addition to temperature and substantial nutrient inputs
from anthropogenic activities. While the direct causality has not been established,
deoxygenation and sometimes hypoxia, occurred more frequently during the summer
months in the Pear! River Estuary (PRE) associated with warmer surface waters, higher

stratification, and increased nutrient inputs from rivers (Qian et al., 2022).

In the Northern South China Sea (NSCS) shelf, a subsurface (along the 20-30 m isobaths)
hypoxic zone develops under a freshwater bulge/plume that occurs during the summer (wet
season, ~June) when there is increased freshwater discharge from the Pear! River (also

known for its substantial nutrient inputs from anthropogenic activities) (Zhao et al., 2021).

The mobilization of waste from the watershed due to rain during the wet season can

contribute to the depletion of DO in the water column. The subsequent improvement in the
dissolved oxygen levels during the dry season is due to the decreased loading from rivers as
well as better reaeration due to the absence of stratification. The same trend was observed

during the field surveys where better water quality was seen during the dry season.

The areas that consistently had relatively lower (and hypoxic) dissolved oxygen levels
observed during the field surveys (near the bottom along the midsection of the bay, along
the eastern and northeastern coast, and at the shallow areas near the rivers) were recreated
by the model runs. Proximity to the sources of waste (rivers, coast), shallow bathymetry, and
debris aggregation and/or low flow areas due to circulation patterns (middle of the bay,
northeastern coast) are some factors that may affect this DO distribution (Jacinto et al.,
2011, Siringan et al., 1998, Villanoy and Martin, 1997, NHRC, 2021).

Loading from rivers creates a bigger impact on the DO levels at the surface and the upper

water column since a parcel of water at the surface with low DO usually forms upon

increased loading in the model. This penetrates up to 5-10 meters in the water column at
different points throughout the bay.

In the model, it takes about 5 days after increased loading for DO at the surface up to 10
meters to be affected in the head and middle of the bay. After decreased loading, the low
near-bottom DO persist but improvement in the water column DO levels is achieved at the
middle and head of the bay. Near the rivers, much of the water column has low dissolved

oxygen levels.

DO levels at the water column are affected by the influx of relatively better-quality water
from the bay’s open boundary. The effect of increased river nutrient loading is mostly seen
at the surface up to just above the pycnocline (~10 meters) but does not have a significant
effect on the whole water column. The water quality at the boundaries has a more relevant

effect on the rest of the water column.

Water quality modeling of Manila Bay during the wet and dry seasons showed that oxygen
levels were lower during the wet season with increased freshwater discharge that led to
stratification of the water column. DO levels during the dry season, which had no
stratification, were higher. Stratification is one of the drivers of decreased oxygen levels
because of limited aeration of the subsurface waters. In addition, low water velocities during
the dry season model run may also contribute to less flow and therefore less water
movement along the water column that can facilitate reaeration of the subsurface and near-

bottom waters.

Monitoring data available suggest eutrophication as the most probable driver of hypoxia in
the southwestern Hong Kong waters but modeling studies also suggest that water flow
leading to convergence and long residence times contribute to the formation of

phytoplankton blooms and subsequent bottom water hypoxia (Qian et al., 2018).

Scenarios that increased nutrient (NH«) and organic matter loading (CBODS) from rivers into
the system showed that the immediate effect is more relevant, initially, for DO levels at the
surface and upper layers. Dissolved oxygen at the bottom waters was maintained
throughout the scenarios citing the importance of the oxygen draw from the sediments

(sediment oxygen demand) as a factor for deoxygenation of near-bottom waters in the


modeled system. On the other hand, water with better water quality from the boundaries is

important in improving the oxygen levels of the water column.

Oxygen demand from the sediments is usually driven by different biogeochemical processes,
a significant portion of which is attributed to the microbial decomposition of organic matter
in the sediment. Dead algae, detritus, and other organic material that settle on the seafloor
undergo decomposition. in Manila Bay, sources of organic matter include untreated
domestic and industrial waste, detritus from algae, and waste from byproducts of

aquaculture and agricultural activities in the watershed (PEMSEA, MBEMP-MBIN, 2007).

SOD is also related to the particulate organic matter loading from the watershed from
various domestic, industrial, and agricultural activities. Reclamation activities in the bay that
involve dredging and dumping also affect SOD. Sediments may release nutrients into the

water column when disturbed which can lower the DO of the overlying water.

‘The midsection of the bay allows sediments to accumulate since it is relatively deep (20-25
m) as well as favors some degree of stratification (Siringan and Ringor, 1998). Clay deposits

have also been found in this area during all seasons (Fuji-ie and Yanagi, 2006). Since clay is

fine-grained and has a large surface area, it tends to adsorb organic matter and pollutants. In
Tolo Harbour (Hong Kong), Hu et al. (2001) found that the stations that contained fine silty

clay sediments had the highest sediment oxygen demand.

The presence of gyres in the middle of the bay (De Las Alas and Sodusta, 1985; Villanoy and
Martin, 1997) can favor the accumulation of sediment, debris, and organic matter that upon
sinking can contribute to oxygen demand. In addition, sediment distribution patterns
suggest that sediments from Pasig River are generally displaced north with a portion
transported offshore through the middle of the bay (Siringan and Ringor, 1998; Villanoy and
Martin, 1997). The sedimentation rate in the bay was found to be 1 and 2 cm/year in its

middle part offshore Bataan and Cavite, respectively (Sombrito et al, 2004).

Field surveys during August 2011 and 2012 have shown relatively higher dissolved organic
carbon along the coast at the head of the bay. The CBOD distribution from the model also
follows a similar pattern pointing to the possible accumulation of organic matter in these

areas that may end up in the sediment, increasing oxygen demand.


These areas at the northern coast of the bay at its head are also where low salinity water
tends to accumulate in the model. Seasonal averages of near-bottom CBOD and NHs in the
model were relatively higher in this area as well. In addition, areas along the northern coast

of the bay had low to hypoxic oxygen levels in most model runs.

Decreased SOD in the modeled system led to an improvement of near-bottom and water
column DO levels after about 13-14 days. At the head of the bay, the low near-bottom DO
did not clear up completely but improved from its hypoxic state. Low near-bottom DO clears

up in the middle of the bay and DO levels at the rest of the water column improve.

The scenario on decreased SOD represents the benefits of better waste management,
improved sewage systems, and nutrient load management in the watershed. However,
decades of management efforts often lead to modest load reductions and hard to quantify
improvements in the ecosystem. In Chesapeake Bay, progress following nutrient load
management has been hard to quantify due to the responses being complex, non-linear, and
season- or location-specific (Murphy et al, 2022). In Tokyo Bay, long term water quality data
from 1989 to 2015 have shown significant decreases following the enactment of wastewater
treatment laws in the 1970s. Despite these, environmental challenges such as red tides and
low DO were still observed in Tokyo Bay even in the recent years (studies from 2012 to
2017) (Kubo et al., 2018).

Upon increasing SOD, DO levels are affected after about the same time (~13-14 days)
decreasing by ~2 gm. Hypoxic near-bottom DO is formed in the shallow areas at the head
of the bay. SOD seems to be an important factor in controlling the DO near the bottom and

in parts of the water column at the subsurface, especially below the pycnocline.

Factors such as bathymetry, proximity to rivers, and water circulation lead to varying
responses of DO levels in the different areas of the bay. Modeling work for Narraganset Bay
showed that the river-dominated upper reaches of the bay (upstream) reached hypoxia

faster than the downstream areas (Knightes et al., 2023).

In terms of timescale, Fennel and Testa (2019) suggested an approach relating the hypoxia

timescale to residence times in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Manila Bay has a residence time of about


31 days. The model in this study estimates a quicker turnover time for hypoxia likely due to
the low SOD set to test the scenario.

Sediment oxygen uptake studies in estuaries affected by deoxygenation and eutrophication
vary. These showed rates that reached up to 2.6 g O2m*day“at Narraganset Bay where
near-bottom DO levels ranged from 1-3 mg I" (Fulweiler et al. 2010). In Chiangjiang Estuary,
a system where SOD is a major oxygen sink below the pycnocline, SOD ranged from 0.29 -
2.0 g 07 m?-day (Zhang et al., 2017). In a heavy aquaculture area in Bolinao, Philippines, the
sediments under the fish pens were rich in organic matter and had high oxygen consumption

ranging from 1.6-8.0 g O2 m?-day (Holmer et al., 2002).

Ina channel adjacent to Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong (downstream of the Pearl River
Estuary), sediment oxygen demand is a dominant factor in the formation of hypoxia. It is
considered an internal forcing in the system that contributes to the depletion of oxygen

even with minimal external forcings such as river discharge from the PRE (Lu et al., 2022).

DO levels, nutrient concentrations, and rates of primary production in shallow coastal areas
can be affected by the decomposition of organic matter in the sediments and the associated
nutrient flux (Fulweiler et al., 2010; Giblin et al., 1997)

On the other hand, in the Chiangjiang estuary, where stratification was also observed, the
low oxygen flux across the pycnocline was found to be much lower than SOD implying that
the low oxygen supply due to stratification promotes the formation and maintenance of
hypoxia in the bottom waters. Numerical experiments in this study also confirmed that
stratification is necessary for the persistence and development of hypoxia while SOD is a

major oxygen sink below the pycnocline (Zhang et al. 2017).

Similar to the general results of the modeling work done in this study, a eutrophication
model for Narragansett Bay showed that nitrogen from the bay's tributaries affected the
upper layers of DO while SOD and nutrient fluxes from sediments affected deeper waters.
Scenarios in their model show that the removal of sediment influence increases DO levels in
the mid-depth and deep waters in all their sites. The work highlighted the importance of
understanding the “legacy” effects of historic nutrient loading to understand the magnitude

and timing of recovery and rehabilitation due to reductions in nutrient loading in the


watershed. It referenced the possible lag in the water quality response of rehabilitation

efforts because of past nutrient loading into the system (Knightes et al., 2023).

3.4.6 Model validation and limitations

Comparison of the salinity and temperature profiles (Figure 3.14) and range of values (Table
3.5) with field surveys were done to validate the data. The salinity profiles were in good
agreement. However, the temperature profiles from the wet season model were lower (“1-3
degrees) than the profiles from the field surveys. The dry season temperature profiles from
the model were in slightly better agreement with the field survey profiles (~1-2 degrees

offset at the surface up to 10 meters).

For the current model purpose, the alignment with salinity profiles from the field is enough
since salinity profiles from the field surveys closely follow density profiles. Density, which is
relevant to stratification, is mostly controlled by salinity in the Manila Bay system, observed

both in the model and field data.

The wider temperature range was also observed during the field surveys. The limitations on
how the model reproduced temperature is likely due to the use of a constant average value
as input for the river discharges and boundary conditions, both for the wet and dry season.
This was based on the average bay wide values and from stations nearest the rivers. A time

varying temperature input will improve the model simulations.

The biggest variation, seen at the surface, could also be due to numerous factors such as
river input, heat flux, precipitation, and evaporation at the surface. The heat flux model only

used monthly averages as inputs.

Tide comparison was done to validate the hydrodynamic model data (Appendix 4.7 and 3.8).

Tide data from three tide gauges were used.

DO and NHs model data were compared with water quality data from the field. The values
are within range of each other and the general distribution in the bay is the same. Since
temporal resolution for the model inputs (river loading and boundary conditions) are a

limitation, some trends were not fully elucidated by the model.


nutrient loading comparison using the nutrient load model (discussed in chapter 4) and
the river loading in the model was done in Table 3.3. The ammonium loading from the
water quality model and the total nitrogen loading predicted by NLM for all rivers draining
into Manila Bay (ammonium being about half of total nitrogen) are within the same
‘magnitude. The same is true for the loading from the Pasig sub watershed from both

models.

A sensitivity test for sediment oxygen demand scenarios was done by adjusting the fSOD
value to 10 (default is 0.5). Dissolved oxygen in the whole system responded quickly to
higher fSOD values. A value between 0.5 and 2.0 reproduced realistic values that were

similar to DO data from the field surveys.

In general, improvement of the temporal resolution of the model inputs for temperature
and salinity will increase the capacity of the model to analyze shorter term and seasonal

differences for salinity and temperature. The same goes for water quality inputs from rivers.

To produce an overview of the different factors affecting dissolved oxygen, the model in its
current state meets the research objectives under the assumption that decomposition of
organic matter dominates the oxygen dynamics in Manila Bay because of the high waste

loads from domestic activities in the watershed.

The “Simple Dissolved Oxygen Model” used for the water quality simulations (WAQ) in
Delft3D, though with limitations on the other processes involving DO, is applicable for the
current objectives. Given the present state of data available to validate the processes
required for a more complicated water quality module, a more straightforward module is

enough.
Since SOD is relevant for DO in the system, it can be adjusted in the current WAQ module

(e.g. finer temporal and spatial scales) for additional scenarios involving management

interventions in the bay.


3.5 Summary, conclusion, and recommendations

Hypoxia and eutrophication are common in estuaries that receive inputs from heavily
polluted rivers such as Manila Bay. The set of models presented in this study successfully
predicts observed water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, and CBODS.
Results are in good agreement with the field surveys during both the wet and dry seasons.

The model depicts estuarine circulation in the bay, marked by the surface outflow of fresh

water and the subsurface inflow of saltier water, initiating at a depth of around 14 meters.

By introducing a freshwater discharge amounting to twice the annual average into the
hydrodynamic model, the model successfully replicated the key characteristics observed
during field surveys conducted in the wet season. On the other hand, a freshwater discharge
input which is half the annual average, recreated key characteristics during the dry season.
This includes the formation of a pycnocline observed at depths ranging from 5 to 15 meters,
which matches the findings of the field surveys. A strong correlation was observed between
the tide gauge measurements and the salinity variations across different depths. The salinity
profiles also exhibited a similar pattern. Stratification was observed to undergo both
formation and dissipation within a time frame of approximately 10 to 15 days. The
stratification during the wet season simulation corresponded to decreased dissolved oxygen
(DO) levels in the water column. Improvement of DO levels during the dry season was also

recreated in the model simulations.

The water quality model utilized monitoring data from rivers which produced results that
aligned with observations made during field surveys. For instance, it identified regions near
the coast and at the subsurface (near the bottom) as areas characterized by lower water
quality conditions. The water quality model reproduced the low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels
near the bottom and the surface distribution of NH and CBODS (compared with dissolved

organic carbon (DOC)) in the field.

The annual river loading of NH« in the model, when compared to the total N loading from
the nutrient load watershed model discussed in Chapter 3 of this study, exhibited similar
magnitudes. Ammonium (NHa) constitutes approximately 50% (on average) of the overall
inorganic nitrogen content found in Manila Bay, as determined through nutrient analysis

conducted during field surveys.


Pollution loading scenarios tested using the water quality model showed that loading from
the rivers is more relevant at the surface up to about 10 meters into the water column and
frequently coincides with a low DO water patch. Low near-bottom DO persist in wet and dry
season runs and is only slightly affected by increased or decreased loading, indicating the
importance of sediment oxygen demand in the modeled system. Boundary conditions are
important in bringing in better quality water into the bay which helps increase DO levels in

the water column.

SOD is a relevant oxygen demand for the modeled system near the bottom and parts of the
water column, especially below the pycnocline. Decreasing sediment oxygen demand
improves DO levels after ~14 days. In estuaries affected by deoxygenation and
eutrophication, the oxygen demand exerted by the decomposition of organic matter in the
sediments is often a significant oxygen sink in the system leading to bottom water hypoxia

and deoxygenation below the pycnocline.

Field surveys have shown that bottom hypoxia or low DO in the bay may be seasonal with
hypoxic conditions clearing up during the dry season surveys or when stratification was not
that strong. The seasonality of near-bottom hypoxia was not resolved but the model was
able to highlight or reiterate the relationship of stratification with deoxygenation or
decreased DO levels. A more explicit time series input for river discharge and concentrations

is needed to better resolve the seasonality of the system.

Efforts to improve the water quality in Manila Bay by improving the loading from rivers may
only be relevant at the surface. The importance of sediment oxygen demand points to the
possible time lag of the effects of efforts to improve water quality and ecosystem health in
Manila Bay due to residual SOD (from old sediments). However, DO/hypoxia clears up in the
near-bottom waters quite fast with decreased SOD (in about 2 weeks) which means that the
feature may not be permanent in Manila Bay. However, hypoxia is likely a recurring

phenomenon as seen in the field observations.

The model's limitations arise from the incomplete resolution or simplifications of certain
biological processes, as well as some components of eutrophication related to other
nutrients, and additional biogeochemical factors. However, for the purpose and scale of this

study, the model was appropriate in reproducing the main features observed in field surveys


and how it relates to the main drivers of oxygen depletion associated with Manila Bay. The
model also allowed for different loading and sediment oxygen demand scenarios to be

tested which can help in the evaluation of possible strategies for improving the water quality
in Manila Bay.

As with any modeling work, better input and monitoring data are required to improve model
performance and to better validate the results. The inputs to the model can be improved
(but are not limited to) with time series data sets (river discharge and water quality data
such as concentrations of nutrients, dissolved and particulate organic compounds, etc.
loading), laboratory studies (to update biogeochemical processes and coefficients),
continued monitoring at existing stations and extending the number of stations to improve

the spatial coverage, as well as updated bathymetries.

Activities in the Manila Bay Watershed

Load Estimates for Manila Bay, Philippines using Population Data. Ocean Science Journal

ABSTRACT

Manila Bay is a busy port area adjacent to the megacity of Metro Manila, Philippines. The
bay receives discharge from 4 major sub-watersheds with an aggregate area of about 19,000
km?and manifests eutrophic and hypoxic conditions. The study used a grid-based model,
statistical data, land use maps, and coefficients to calculate the nutrient loads from the

watershed and their relative contributions.

As much as 66% of the total nitrogen (TN) and 59% of total phosphorus (TP) loading into
Manila Bay are derived from point or domestic sources while agriculture accounts for 22% of
TN and 30% of TP. Other sources account for 12% of TN and 11% of TP. The National Capital
Region (or Metro Manila), which is only 614 km?, already accounts for about 30% of the
population residing in the catchment area of the bay. The area normalized total nutrient
load coming from this region alone is at 23,000 kg-N km” and 1,900 kg-P km?,

Densely populated provinces adjacent to the bay contributed the majority of the domestic
waste load while the rural provinces, which are associated with agricultural activities,
contributed most of the nutrient loads from agriculture. Relatively smaller but densely
populated watersheds like the Pasig River sub-watershed and the Cavite River sub-
watershed contributed almost as much as the largest sub-watershed (Pampanga River Basin)

in terms of total nutrient loading.

Three major aspects of the nutrient loading problem were tested in the scenario building
forecasts: sewage connections and treatment, decentralization of densely populated areas
and population growth rate, and phosphorus content regulation in detergents. With the
continued high population growth (driven principally by migration into Metro Manila),
nutrient loading from the domestic sector will continue to increase. Sewage treatment will
help decrease the nutrient load, but tertiary treatment may be required for a

significant decrease.


However, in the short term, a ban on phosphorus content in detergents could help decrease
loads by almost as much as tertiary treatment albeit at a lesser cost. Decongesting the
densely populated Metro Manila by providing urban amenities and jobs in the provinces and

in other parts of the country is a way to help address the nutrient problem in Manila Bay.
The tool used in this study provided a relatively quick way to assess the contributions of

nutrient sources, build scenarios, and consider options that may be useful for policymakers

and management bodies.


4.1 Introduction

The increase in world population from less than 1.7 billion in the 1900s to more than 6.1
billion people in 2000 (Goldewijk et al., 2010) has caused crop and livestock production to
increase to meet the demands of a growing population. As a result of this, fertilizer use also
increased from almost negligible amounts at the beginning of the 20" century to more than
80 million tons of nitrogen (N) and 14 million tons of phosphorus (P) in the year 2000
because of the need to supply more nutrients to plants. In 2015, the world demand for
nitrogen and phosphorus was 110 and 41 million tons respectively, and is expected to

increase by 1.5 and 2.2% from 2015 to 2020 (FAO, 2017, 2015).

Nutrients from agricultural systems leak onto water bodies through surface runoff, seepage,
leaching, and groundwater transport. Domestic and industrial systems also discharge
wastewater directly to surface waters contributing to the nutrient emission. Unfortunately,
these flows have been increasing rapidly in the 20" century due to the rapid growth of
population, urbanization, sewage connection, and lagging wastewater treatment

(Morée et al., 2013).

Coastal ecosystems are considerably exposed to pollution from anthropogenic sources due
to inputs from land, rivers, marine sources, and the atmosphere. The development of urban
areas along the coast and in Manila Bay in particular, the proliferation of informal settlers,
coupled with overpopulation and high precipitation has caused serious water quality

deterioration problems in water bodies worldwide (Shahidul Islam and Tanaka, 2004).

Manila Bay is an important water body in the southwestern part of Luzon Island in the
Philippines serving as a major port and source of livelihood for many coastal communities
along its 190 km coastline (PEMSEA and MBEMP-MBIN, 2007). It has a 19,720 km?
catchment area populated by 31 million people or 34% of the total population of the
Philippines in 2010 which increased to 38.5 million people or 38% of the total population in
2015. in 2020, the population in the catchment area was 48.7 M (BSWM, 2012; NSO, 2010;
Philippine Statistics Authority, 2023). In the whole Philippines, population increased by 34%
in 20 years (1990 - 2010) with a growth rate of 2.12%. While in the National Capital Region
(NCR including Metro Manila), the population grew by 33% with a growth rate of 2.02%
(NSO, 2010).


Sources of waste from the Manila Bay watershed include agriculture, aquaculture, industrial,
and domestic activities. There are five general land uses within the Manila Bay watershed:
agriculture areas (croplands and livestock) comprise 42%, grassland/shrub land comprise
21%, forest/woodland comprise 11%, wetlands including fishponds comprise 3%, and
miscellaneous land uses comprise 22% (BSWM, 2012).

Urban activities, though concentrated in small areas, dramatically alter regional and global
nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles, especially in places near the coast (Svirejeva-Hopkins
et al., 2011; Van Drecht et al., 2009). In Metro Manila (National Capital Region) alone, the
population density was as high as 19,137 people/km? (NSO, 2010). Wastewater from urban
areas is emitted as point sources with large nutrient loads from domestic sewage (including
excreta from humans and animals), P-based detergents, agriculture, and industries (Morée
et al., 2013). Detrimental effects of excessive nutrient loading into an ecosystem include
eutrophication, oxygen depletion (hypoxia), harmful algal blooms (ABs), and fish kills most
of which have been observed in Manila Bay (Azanza et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2009; Jacinto
et al., 2006; Prudente et al,, 1994; Reichardt et al., 2006, Jacinto et al., 2011,

Sotto et al., 2014),

In the Manila Bay watershed, the nutrient load problem is aggravated by the fact that in
Metro Manila, only about 20% of the population has sewerage services (Implementation
Status and Results: Manila Third Sewerage Project, 2012). in 2005, only 8% were fully
treated (up to secondary) (GEF, 2005). A law exists that mandates that each house should be
provided with a septic tank to remove solids. Generally, industrial and commercial
wastewater is discharged with very little or no treatment and most of the waterways in
Metro Manila are heavily contaminated (GEF, 2005). Residential sewage constitutes about
65-75% of pollution in Metro Manila while the rest comes from industries and solid waste
dumped into drainage systems or rivers and coastal areas (GEF, 2005). In effect, most of the

wastewater that drains out into the bay contains untreated sewage.

The Pasig River Basin, a sub-basin of the Manila Bay watershed, delivers about 21% of the
organic pollution load and nearly 82% of the total sewage generated in Manila City is
discharged without any treatment through an outfall in Manila Bay (GEF, 2005). Pampanga
River contributes about 49% of the net freshwater influx while Pasig River contributes about

21%; the remaining 26% comes from the other minor rivers while 4% comes from


precipitation (Jacinto et al., 1999). At about 9 km upstream from the mouth of the
Pampanga River, the annual nitrate load is estimated at 2849 metric tons. For phosphorus,

the load was estimated at 358 metric tons per year (BSWM and PNRI, 2013).

Severe land-based pollution is a consequence of the rapid urbanization in the coastal cities
surrounding the bay as well as areas included in the watershed. In developing countries like
the Philippines, the construction of sewage systems often lags behind the development of
cities. Therefore, untreated domestic sewage is one, if not, the biggest contributor to
pollution in Manila Bay. A project funded by the GEF, the Manila Third Sewerage Project
(MTSP) was developed in 2005 to help develop the sewage system in Manila (GEF, 2005). As
of December 2012, the MTSP was able to increase sewerage coverage from 3% in 2003 to
30% in 2012 for the eastern section of Metro Manila (WorldBank, 2012). Wastewater
treatment has since increased to 14.5% in 2019. Plans for the improvement of sewage
treatment in the city are underway but these do not yet include the treatment of sewage up

to tertiary to address the excess nutrient input (Balinbin, 2021).

Despite being the 8" largest rice producer in the world, accounting for 2.8% of the global
rice production (FAO, 2010) the Philippines does not have a strictly agricultural economy.
Agriculture, fishery, and forestry account for 20% of the economy's aggregate domestic
input (GDP) (Habito and Briones, 2005). An estimated total of 42 kilotons of nitrogen
fertilizer was applied to 4810 km? of rice fields in the Pampanga River basin. However, the
rice plants effectively absorbed only 21 kilotons, with the rest loading into the environment
(BSWM, 2012). The estimated nitrogen loss to surface water was as much as 0.4 to 5

kilotons which is about half of what was applied.

‘Though a few watershed and pollution load studies have been done for the Manila Bay
watershed; these have temporal and spatial limitations. For example, the pollutant loading
study commissioned by PEMSEA in 2012 only included the Pasig and Laguna de Bay sub-
watersheds while the watershed studies are limited to 15-20 stations along rivers with at

most 4 temporal data points per station.

This study aims to complement these efforts by using models to cover a bigger study area

and a wider range of temporal scenarios.


‘An advantage of using models is the ability to test different scenarios and use the results to
address different policy issues in the rehabilitation and pollution management of Manila
Bay. For example, since the sewage system in the Philippines is still largely underdeveloped,
scenarios that tackle the effectiveness of sewage treatment were investigated to help assess.
the significance of interventions related to sewage treatment. Another example is the effect

of the ever-increasing population of the Philippines on the waste loading into Manila Bay.

Following the result of field studies showing hypoxia and eutrophication in Manila Bay
(Jacinto et al., 2011; Sotto et al., 2014), this study aims to identify and quantify the different
sources of nutrients in Manila Bay and apply scenario building to determine the efficiency of
different load reduction strategies. Three models are employed: a point source model using
population data, an agricultural model looking at agricultural and aquaculture-related
activities, and a transport model that aggregates the nutrient loads from the watershed and

routes them into the bay.

4.2 Methodology

4.2.1 General description

The nutrient load model has three main parts: the point source/urban waste flow model, the
agriculture and aquaculture model, and the transport model. The point source model
calculates the N and P emissions per grid cell using population data while the agriculture and
aquaculture model calculates the emissions per grid cell using statistics (animal inventory,
production data, etc.). The distribution/weighing per grid cell was based on land use maps
(e.g. population density, agricultural areas, and fish pond areas) using a weighted average
system based on the appropriate parameter. A mass transport model determined the basin
delineation based on a flow direction map accounting for downstream nutrient transport to.

determine the total loading into the bay.

The nitrogen inputs considered are from protein intake/human excreta, fertilizer use, and
animal manure. Phosphorus inputs are from fertilizer, animal manure, and detergent use.
Nutrient losses come from sewage systems (leakage, treatment, volatilization), in-stream
retention, and crop uptake. N and P emissions were calculated as loads in kilograms per
year. Different scenarios were then tested based on possible policy options for rehabilitation

of the bay (e.g. better sewage treatment, regulation of phosphorus content in detergents).

This model was based on the work of Moreé et al., 2013, Beusen et al., 2015 and 2016, and
Bouwman et al., 2013 looking at land-based nutrient flows at the global scale and was

designed as a scaled-down version on a regional and basin scale level.

4.2.2. Grid system

The grid system has a resolution of 1 km with the following limits in decimal degrees: (13 N,

120 €) and (16.5 N, 122 €). This includes most of Luzon Island and the whole watershed of
Manila Bay. A flow direction map was generated using a digital elevation map from SRTM at
a 90-meter resolution (Jarvis et al., 2008). Areas included in the maps presented that are not

part of the watershed of Manila Bay are not included in the calculations.

4.2.3 Point source/ urban waste flow model

The point source model was designed to calculate the amount of N and P emissions in a grid
cell based on the land area and the number of people residing in that area. The emission is
then fed into the mass transport model which aggregates the loads per basin based ona
flow direction map (DEM-based). Different forecast scenarios with varying degrees of
sewage connections, wastewater treatment levels, and population scenarios were done to

test possible strategies that can be taken to reduce nutrient loading in Manila Bay.

4.2.4 Population data

Population data was obtained from the 2010 and 2015 census by the National Statistics
Office/ Philippine Statistics Authority (NSO, 2010; Philippine Statistics Authority, 2016) at the
provincial level. The 2010 data was used as the baseline. Published and projected NSO
annual average population growth rates and FAO annual population projections were used
for future scenarios (FAOSTAT, 2017; National Statistics Office, 2014). The fraction of the
population per province considered as urban was based on the definition by the NSO. A
barangay/town (smallest political unit) is considered urban if it meets any of the following
criteria: has a population size of 5000 or more, has at least one establishment with a
minimum of 100 employees, has five or more establishments with 10 to 99 employees, and
five or more facilities within a 2 km radius from the barangay hall. Otherwise, it is considered
rural. Many barangays make up a province (NSO, 2010). Coastal populations are classified as

people living within 1 km from the coast whose emissions are considered to flow directly


into the bay without any retention factors. Table 4.1 shows the list of provinces included in
the study area and a sample of the population data that was used.

4.2.5 Sewerage systems and septic tanks

In the Philippines, several households have septic tanks instead of sewer systems (pipes),
especially in the provinces/rural areas. Therefore, the percent connection to sewage pipes
per province used was set at a minimum of 10% for all provinces except for Metro Manila
(30%) and Pampanga (15%). In fact, in Metro Manila (NCR), based on the records of the
MUWSS for 2014, only 7.6% of the water-served population is connected to sewerage services
while in Cavite, only 0.2% of the water-served population is connected (Maynilad, 2014). In
the 2003 NSO survey, 42% of the households in the country used water-sealed sewer or
septic tanks. These septic tanks are regularly serviced by the water service providers: MWSS

or Maynilad. For this study, Pampanga and Metro Manila, having slightly better sewage


connections, will be assigned 15 and 30% connection to sewage pipes respectively. As of the
2015 report from the two concessionaires providing sewerage services to Metro Manila,
14% of the population is served by Maynilad and 13% is served by Manila Water for a total
of about 27% sewage connections for Metro Manila. Connection to pipes and subsequent
sewage treatment will be considered separate since the construction of treatment plants
often lag behind the construction of sewage systems by several decennia in many
industrialized and developing countries (Van Drecht et al., 2009). NSO has data per province
on the average number of persons in a household and the number of households plus

information on the kind of toilet facility based on a 20% sample households.

4.2.6 Treatment of population data

‘The population data was treated according to the schematic diagram in Figure 4.1.
Population data was separated into three categories: urban, rural, and coastal (people living

1. km from the coast) which followed the retention and flow scheme shown below.

4.2.7 Gross Human N and P flows

Nand P flows from humans come from human excreta and P in detergents. N estimates in
human excreta are based on protein consumption from FAO data (FAO, 2010),
supplemented by data from Food and Balance sheets in the Philippines. For most countries
during 1961-2000, country data on retail stage per capita protein consumption are available.
N content in protein was set at 0.16 (Block and Bolling, 1946) with the P content estimated
from N using the N:P ratio of 10:1 based on a twentieth-century N and P consumption data
set for the United States by the US Department of Agriculture in 2012. Excretion is in the
form of urine (80% of intake for N and 62% for P is lost) and feces (17% for N and 35% for P);

3% of N and P intake is also lost via sweat, hair, and blood (Morée et al., 2013).

Total urban emission is based on: the fractions of the population (i) connected to sewage
pipes, (ii)connected to septic tanks, and (iii) not connected. In the model, people connected
to pipes were considered to live in urban areas. Total rural emission comes from people
connected to septic tanks and people who are not connected. Emissions from the coast are

those from people who live 1 km from the coast with waste discharged directly into the bay.

4.2.8 Wastewater flows

Wastewater from the population with a sewage connection can undergo primary,
secondary, or tertiary treatment, or have no treatment, each with corresponding N or P
retention. Waste flow from unconnected people undergo further reduction as they are
transported to rivers. In the model, septic tanks were considered as settling systems so only
urine was considered to flow into rivers. The solid waste from septic tanks can be considered
later on for recycling into agriculture. For waste that goes through sewage pipes, there is
less retention of nutrients, especially since only a part of the waste goes through treatment.

4.2.9 Nand P removal due to sewage treatment and system losses

Estimated sewer leakage, biological degradation, nutrient particle settlement, and
volatilization processes are 10% for both N and P. Primary treatment indicates 10% N and P
removal, secondary treatment has 35% N and 45% P removal, while tertiary treatment has
80% N and 90% P removal (Morée et al., 2013).

4.2.10 Phosphorus from detergents

Phosphorus load from laundry detergent use was taken from the unpublished study of
Scholtz et al. (2015) which analyzed 10 different laundry detergent samples in the
Philippines for their P content (Scholz et al., 2015, 2014). A value of 46 g P/person/year was
used in the model based on the average number of people in households and an estimate of
12.3 g P kg detergent (P content). In the Philippines, washing dishes by hand using liquid
dishwashing detergent is a common practice instead of using dishwashers. These liquid
dishwashing detergents used in hand washing are often low in phosphorus or phosphorus-
free, unlike their dishwashing machine counterparts which require more aggressive cleaning
agents (Burnside and Mcdowell, 2001). The model used a value of 0.22 g P/person/year P
content in dishwashing detergents and an estimate of 1-L of liquid dishwashing detergent

used per household of 5 people per month (Comber et al., 2013).

4.2.11 Agriculture and aquaculture model

The agriculture and aquaculture component was patterned after the work of Beusen in 2014

but was modified to address certain limitations and local peculiarities of the study site. The


same concept as the point source model was applied to the agriculture and aquaculture
model wherein statistical data from the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) such as the
amount of fertilizer and area applied, number of livestock heads, and volume of production
of aquaculture, were used to calculate the N and P emissions per cell which were then

allocated by weight with agriculture area (or aquaculture area) used as the weighing factor.

4.2.12 Transport coefficient for nutrients

A transport coefficient for nutrients from fertilizers was derived from average values for
Eastern Asia from the results of the modeling work done as part of the Integrated Model to.
‘Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE) by Beusen et al. (2016) which looks at the fraction
of the Nand P input lost due to several processes. A summary of the coefficients used in the
model is provided in Table 4.2.

4.2.13 Data inventory

For agriculture, land use maps from PEMSEA and BSWM were used corresponding to
aggregated agricultural areas specifically: cultivated areas mixed with brushland/grassland,
cropland mixed with coconut plantation, and arable land with crops (mainly cereals and
sugar). Statistical data from the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) on fertilizer use
include estimated annual inorganic fertilizer use by grade and by region (urea, ammonium
sulfate, ammonium phosphate, and compound fertilizers), area harvested, area applied, and
the average quantity applied. Rice and corn (major crops) inventory per province were also

used. For animals, livestock and poultry inventory by farm type and province was used


(number of heads of carabao, cattle, goat, hog, and poultry) (Philippine Statistics Authority,
nd.) (Table 4.3).

For aquaculture, the maps and classifications used for the distribution of the loads were as.
follows. Fishpond areas based on satellite imagery were used for the distribution of
freshwater aquaculture production volume data (Table 4.5). in addition, the length of rivers
per grid cell was also used as a weighting factor for freshwater aquaculture. The grid cells
along the coast were classified as marine using the area of the coast that is less than 3
meters (or 20% of the grid cell) representing areas where mariculture can take place. For
brackish water aquaculture, the length of the rivers along the coasts was used as the

weighting factor.

4.2.14 Water transport model

‘The generated nutrient loads from the agriculture, aquaculture, and point source
components, are routed to downstream grids and then to the mouth of rivers using an
operation called Accuflux. Accuflux uses a local drain direction map (LDD) generated from a
digital elevation map (DEM) to determine the flow path for each grid cell in the area.
Accuflux calculates the accumulated amount of material (nutrients) in each grid cell that
flows out into adjacent downstream grid cells using net precipitation. The accumulated
amount of material is equal to the amount of material in the cell plus the amount of material
from its adjacent upstream cell minus retention. Accuflux uses annual precipitation and

temperature maps as input data to calculate the net precipitation.

4.2.15 Scenario construction

The nutrient load model (NLM) for Manila Bay was designed to evaluate the baseline status
of the bay based on the nutrient loading from the watershed. The scenario-building feature
was used to evaluate the impact of different load reduction options tackling population
dynamics that may be applied to the bay. The following scenarios were tested: a baseline

‘scenario, a scenario representing a total ban on phosphorus in detergents, a scenario with

full tertiary treatment, a scenario with half of the population growth rate used, a tertiary
treatment and growth rate scenario, and two scenarios wherein half of the population in
Metro Manila was distributed to five different provinces to represent decentralization of
urban centers. The baseline year is 2010 and FAO and NSO projections were used to
simulate the population growth rate (Table 4.1. List of provinces and population data in
1000s of inhabitants; 2020, 2030, and 2050 are projected data from the National Statistics
Office and the FAO (FAOSTAT, 2017; National Statistics Office, 2014)Table 4.1). The details of
the scenarios are shown in Table 4.6 below.

All other coefficients, parameters, and emission rates aside from those listed in the table
remained unchanged. Land use maps used were unchanged for simplicity under the
assumption that most urban centers remain unchanged in the watershed and that the

domestic sector is a major enough loading source that change

land use may only have a

small effect in total loading.

Land use maps can be changed in the model, but the method is quite tedious to perform for

every scenario year since the conversion to gridded data that can be used as an input to the

water transport model has not been automated in mapping software.

4.3 Results and Discussion

4.3.1 Baseline scenario

Of the total load to Manila Bay for nitrogen, the domestic sector was seen as a major source
of nutrient load at 66% of the total followed by agriculture at 22% (Figure 4.2). The waste
from the domestic sector includes domestic sewage from houses which is treated only up to.

secondary and waste directly discharged through rivers.

Figure 4.2. Breakdown of the major sources of nitrogen loading to Manila Bay in kg N/year. Major
sources include domestic (N-Domestic), aquaculture (N-Aqua), coast (people living along the coast) (N-
Coast), and agriculture (N-Agri, N-Fertilizer, and N-manure).

The same is seen for phosphorus loading with the domestic sector accounting for 59% and
the agriculture sector accounting for 30% (Figure 4.3). In addition, detergents from domestic

waste are also a source of phosphorus loading.

The total nitrogen load amounted to 48.2 Million kg y? while the total phosphorus load
amounted to 4.2 Million kg y*. Though domestic sources are a bigger source of nutrient
loading to Manila Bay, addressing the agricultural sector, including livestock and poultry, will

also help in the reduction of nutrient loading to Manila Bay.

sources include domestic (P-Domestic), aquaculture (P-Aqua), coast (people living along the coast) (P-
Coast), and agriculture (P-Agri, P-Fertilizer, and P-manure).

The highest nutrient loads for both nitrogen and phosphorus were located at the eastern
part of the watershed of Manila Bay near the urban and densely populated areas of Metro
Manila, Cavite, and parts of Bulacan (Figure 4.4). Elevated loads were also seen at the
agricultural areas in the watershed further north of the bay. Aside from the magnitude of
people that generate waste in the watershed, the location of the nutrient load sources also
plays a factor. Unfortunately, the densely populated areas of Metro Manila, Cavite, and
parts of Bulacan are situated just adjacent to the bay so the waste almost directly feeds into
the bay. Agricultural areas which also contribute to N and P load via the use of fertilizers are
situated farther from the bay and in relatively flat areas in the northern part of the

watershed which may affect the transport of material downstream.

Figure 4.4, Nitrogen (A) and phosphorus (8) loading maps in the watershed of Manila Bay. Darker
areas represent bigger sources of nutrient loads which are mostly situated near the bay.


4.3.2 Nutrient loading per sub-watershed

‘The nutrient loads were disaggregated into sub-watersheds (Figure 4.6). It was found that
the Cavite and Pasig sub-watersheds contributed almost as much as the largest sub-
watershed (Pampanga) to the total nutrient loads from the domestic sector because of their
high population densities.

The Pampanga sub-watershed, which is the largest, has increased nutrient loading from

agricultural activities since a lot of rice and corn crops are grown in the area (Figure 4.5).

Buacan i

Figure 4.7. (A) Provinces in the Manila Bay watershed and (B) percent contribution of each province to
nitrogen loading per sector.

The nutrient loads were also disaggregated by province and per sector (Figure 4.7). Metro
Manila, situated near the bay, contributes a lot to the domestic sources of waste while rural
provinces like Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, and Pampanga which are situated further up the
watershed, have more agricultural activities and therefore contribute more to nutrient
loading from fertilizers and animal manure. The majority of fish ponds in the Manila Bay
Watershed are situated along the coasts of Pampanga and Bulacan so most of the waste

from aquaculture activities comes from these provinces.

Asub-watershed or per province specific approach can be implemented for different policies
and programs for the rehabilitation of the bay targeting specific sectors, areas, and
provinces for a better, more specific, and effective nutrient load reduction strategy. This can
be done in addition to watershed or nationwide efforts and policies targeting nutrient load
reduction.


4.3.3 Comparison of the different scenarios with the baseline

The baseline and all the other scenarios tested show increasing nutrient loads given the
projected growth rates throughout the years. Despite all the interventions tested using the
scenarios, loading to the bay will continue to increase. The difference is that certain

scenarios, when implemented, result in a slower increase rate in nutrient loading.

4.3.3.1 Scenarios testing phosphorus content ban in detergents and tertiary treatment

A comparison between scenario 1 (phosphorus ban) and scenario 2 (tertiary treatment) with

the baseline both show slower increase in nutrient loading.(Figure 4.8).
If wastewater treatment were to improve up to tertiary in the country or even just Metro

Manila, along with better sewage pipe connections, a 15% decrease in phosphorus load

compared with the baseline runs was observed.

Figure 4.8. Total phosphorus loading for the scenarios: baseline, scenario01 (phosphorus ban), and
scenario02 (tertiary treatment).


Tertiary treatment is more effective at reducing phosphorus loads but this would require the
updating of and/or installation of new sewage systems. An additional alternative which may
be a more cost-effective measure would be to impose a phosphorus ban on detergents
which is almost half as effective as tertiary treatment. Combined, a phosphorus ban and
improvements in wastewater treatment will be a good strategy to reduce phosphorus
loading into the bay. In addition, tertiary treatment will also reduce nitrogen loading into the

system.

4.3.3.2 Scenarios testing population growth rate, decentralization of urban population,

and tertiary treatment

The rapid population growth rate in Metro Manila is also brought about by the influx of
people from the different provinces. Scenarios 03 and 04 were done to test the projected
population growth rates and tertiary treatment while scenarios 06 and 07 were done to test
the effect of decentralization of highly dense urban cities by spreading out the forecasted

population in Metro Manila,

Scenarios 6 and 7 represent a scenario wherein densely populated urban centers are
decentralized by making living in the rural provinces more attractive (e.g. building
infrastructure, improving roads, creating better jobs, etc.) (Figure 4.9). This is done by
distributing half the population in Metro Manila to five different provinces in the watershed.
Sewage treatment is also simultaneously improved in these provinces in scenario 07 up to

tertiary treatment.
The scenarios wherein the projected load increase are slowest are with half the population

growth rate and treatment, decentralization and treatment, and tertiary treatment (at

status quo).

Figure 4.9. Total nitrogen and phosphorus loading for the baseline, scenario 02 (tertiary treatment),
scenario 06 (decentralization of population), and scenario 07 (decentralization of population with
tertiary treatment).

With only secondary wastewater treatment in place, reducing the population growth rate or
moving the population away from dense urban areas near the bay is almost half as effective
as applying tertiary treatment. A strategy that can be implemented is to make living in the
provinces farther from the bay more attractive to lessen the waste load in the areas near the
bay. Throughout the years, the nutrient loads are still increasing even with improved sewage
treatment but at a slower rate so the implementation of strategies such as improving
wastewater treatment, decentralizing the urban centers, and implementing a phosphorus

ban might be a way for the bay to recover.

4.3.4 Comparison with similar studies

A comparison with a similar study on the total pollutant loading in Laguna Bay done by the
Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) and PEMSEA in 2012 revealed an underestimate
of the nutrient loading calculated using the model in this study (Table 4.7). A subset of the
Manila Bay watershed in this model (NLM) corresponding to the sub-watershed used in the
LLDA study was used in the comparison. This study produced less amounts of total N (36%

less) and total P (76% less) loads as compared with the LLDA study. Differences may have


stemmed from the methodologies and sub-watershed delineation. The LLDA study had no
natural purification at surface waters and considers the contribution from the industry with
better estimates {inventory data). It also had no discharge or flow model applied to the
calculations meaning that the loads represent the total that may drain into the bay unlike
the model in this study wherein a flow model was incorporated. A breakdown of the sources
of waste for total N in the total pollutant loading study shows that 89% come from domestic
sources, 7% from agriculture, and 6% from industries. This study (NLM) showed that a bigger
percentage is allotted to agriculture as a waste source at 38% of the total, with 62% coming

from domestic sources for total N.

Updated estimates for pollutant loading from other studies are only available for Total P. In
2022, an estimated 27,257,000 M kg/yr TP was discharged from domestic wastewater in the
Manila Bay region after an estimated 8% reduction due to the existing sewage treatment
facilities (NEDA, 2020). The estimates are higher compared with the results of this study
because no retention or waste flow calculations were applied. The estimate is population-

based.

4.4 Summary, conclusion, and recommendations

Comparison of our model with observations is difficult, but the data from LLDA suggest that
our modeled nutrient load estimates are at least within the same magnitude of results from
other loading studies and available data. Given differences in methodologies, a direct
comparison cannot be made. A major conclusion is that for supporting this kind of analysis,
long-term monitoring data of discharge and nutrient concentration should be available,

preferably open access.


Domestic sources are a major source of nutrient load as compared with agriculture so efforts
can be focused on this sector utilizing strategies such as the improvement of sewage
systems and connection to pipes as well as upgrading wastewater treatment facilities to

tertiary treatment systems which will drastically reduce N and P loading into Manila Bay.

With the continued high population growth driven principally by migration into Metro
Manila, nutrient loading from the domestic sector will continue to increase throughout the
years. Therefore, decentralizing the highly dense urban areas and making living outside of
Metro Manila (and the immediate vicinity of the bay) attractive will also help in better waste
management. For example, recent efforts to build up Clark as a new business district can

help move people away from Metro Manila,

A ban on phosphorus content in detergents could also help decrease phosphorus loads
almost as much as tertiary treatment but at a lesser cost of implementation. This strategy is
a low-cost option to reduce phosphorus loading into the environment before investing in

tertiary sewage treatment systems or as the sewage systems in place are upgraded.

Sub-watersheds and provinces differ in their nutrient loading characteristics so policies and
rehabilitation efforts can be on a per province or per sub-watershed format to consolidate
and unify target issues and goals. For example, certain provinces can be targeted for better
waste management of animal waste or fertilizer waste which in turn, reduces N loads.

The NLM, using predicted rainfall maps, can be a useful tool to test how increased rainfall
affects nutrient loading. Heavy daily rainfall, extreme rainfall events, and the number of dry
days are expected to increase in the Philippines as a consequence of climate change. More
rainfall will lead to easier transport of nutrients from the watershed while dry days will lead
to longer retention on land. However, increased temperatures can increase plant uptake of

nutrients which may lead to an increase in fertilizer use (Costa et al., 2023; PAGASA, 2023).

The nutrient load model presented an idea of the dynamics of nutrient loading into Manila
Bay from the watershed and how the different facets of the nutrient loading problem can be
addressed by certain load reduction strategies that may be cheaper and relatively easier to
implement. Though better sewage systems with tertiary treatment are the ideal
interventions to manage excessive nutrient loading, other strategies suggested above can be

done while these improvements are in the pipeline.

5. Chapter 5: Synthesis

Manila Bay is considered one of the most important harbors in Southeast Asia that connects
the Philippines with its neighboring countries for commerce and trade (Jacinto et al., 2006a).
Itis in the southwestern part of Luzon Island, Philippines serving as a major port and source
of livelihood for many coastal communities along its 190 km coastline (PEMSEA and MBEMP-
MBIN, 2007).

Unfortunately, the bay has been identified as a marine pollution hotspot in the seas of East
Asia by PEMSEA with issues like harmful algal blooms, persistent red tides, heavy metal
pollution, excess organic loads, and oxygen depletion (Azanza et al., 2004; Chang et al.,
2009; Jacinto et al., 2006b; PEMSEA and MBEMP, 2007; Prudente et al., 1994; Reichardt et
al., 2006).

The occurrence of deoxygenation, hypoxia, and eutrophication in Manila Bay was reported
in several studies with near-bottom DO levels in the bay falling to as low as 1 mg!” (June
2008) and nutrient levels exceeding the ASEAN water quality criteria (Chang et al., 2009;
Jacinto et al., 2006b; Jacinto et al., 2011; Sotto et al., 2014; Sy et al., 2016). Field surveys
done during the wet season consistently showed evidence of stratification and hypoxia
(which was often more severe during the wet season). Minimal improvement over time was

observed throughout the seasonal/annual surveys (Sy et al., 2016).

Five bay-wide field surveys were conducted in Manila Bay, Philippines during the wet and
dry seasons wherein low water column and near-bottom hypoxia were observed. An
increase in the area affected by low DO (both horizontally and vertically) throughout the
subsequent surveys was a cause for concern (Figure 5.1). Low DO conditions, especially at
the bottom, occurred throughout the year but DO levels were lowest during the wet season.
Low DO levels coincide with the presence of stratification, elevated nutrient concentrations,

chlorophyll-a levels, and dissolved organic carbon.


A shoaling oxycline and an increasing thickness of the hypoxic layer were also observed over
time, indicating problematic conditions for the bay like habitat compression for pelagic
species, especially during the wet season. Increased freshwater discharge during the wet
season brings in more pollution loading from the watersheds draining into the bay; this
promotes eutrophication and deoxygenation in Manila Bay.

Figure 5.1. Dissolved oxygen cross-section plots from north to south for February 2010 (A), July 2010
(8), February 2021 (C), August 2011 (D), and August 2012 (E) going from the coast to the mouth of
Manila Bay and section plots from west to east for February 2010 (F), July 2010 (G), February 2011 (H),
August 2011 (1), and August 2012 (J) going from the coast of Bataan to Metro Manila.

More frequent field surveys and time-series analyses are needed to further evaluate the
spatiotemporal dynamics of hypoxia and eutrophication in Manita Bay. Such data sets will
prove useful in improving inputs to modeling work, the results of which can be beneficial to
the rehabilitation and management programs for the bay.


In the second part of the study, a hydrodynamic model was developed for Manila Bay with
freshwater discharges from major rivers as the main input. Two main regimes were tested,
the wet season with twice the annual average discharge from rivers, and the dry season with

half the annual average discharges (Figure 5.2).

The model reproduced the stratification observed during the wet season field surveys as
well as the depth of the pycnocline between 5-15 meters (Figure 5.3). Stratification was
found to form and dissipate in about 15-20 days. Water levels produced by the model were
consistent with the water levels from tide gauges and the profiles for salinity and

temperature were similar to the field surveys.

‘Awater quality model was also developed using ammonium (NH) and carbonaceous
biochemical oxygen demand (CBODS) as the main pollution-loading inputs from the rivers
draining into Manila Bay (Figure 5.4). The model results were in good agreement with
observations, as it (i) reproduced the differences in water quality during the wet and dry
season, (ii) identified regions near the coast and at the subsurface (near-bottom) as areas
characterized by lower water quality conditions. (iii) reproduced the general distribution of
dissolved oxygen with lower DO near the coasts (northern coast near Pampanga and eastern
coast near Pasig) at the surface, and (iv) predicted low dissolved oxygen in the near-bottom
layers. A comparison with DO levels between the wet and dry season model runs shows
higher DO levels during the dry season throughout most of the water column and the bay,

consistent with field surveys.

Pollution loading scenarios showed that loading from the rivers is more relevant at the
surface up to about 10 meters into the water column and frequently coincides with a low DO
water patch. Low near-bottom DO concentrations persist in wet and dry season runs and are
only slightly affected by increased or decreased loading, indicating the importance of

sediment oxygen demand (SOD) in the modeled system. Boundary conditions are important

in bringing in better quality water into the bay which helps increase the DO levels in the

water column.

SOD is an important component of the modeled system for the near-bottom water layers
and parts of the water column below the pycnocline. Changes in loading from the rivers
affect the system in less than a week while the response to adjusting SOD is delayed and
takes about 14 days (Figure 5.5). Most of the water column is affected near the head of the
bay. In the middle of the bay, near-bottom DO levels decrease. At the mouth of the bay, DO
levels decrease at the surface (due to the proximity of the station to the shallow water areas
with significant river influence) but are relatively unchanged for the rest of the water
column, The change in DO levels is ~ + 1.0 - 2.0 gm.


The hydrodynamic and water quality model of Manila Bay was able to reproduce some of
the major features observed during the field surveys conducted. A key implication of the
modeling work is that deoxygenation of the bay is not a permanent feature and can be
alleviated with less loading from rivers and DO levels increase upon lowering SOD. Low DO.
or hypoxia at the bottom of the bay can clear up with lower SOD, where changes in DO
levels occur after 1-2 weeks. The seasonality of near-bottom hypoxia was not resolved but

the model was able to highlight the relationship of stratification with deoxygenation or
decreased DO levels.

‘The rehabilitation of Manila Bay is a continuing effort of the government in compliance with
the Writ of Mandamus issued by the Supreme Court on December 18, 2008. Under the
Order, the SC directed 13 agencies of the government, including the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), “to clean up, rehabilitate, and preserve the Bay,
and restore and maintain its water to Class SB level — fit for swimming, skin diving, and other

forms of contact recreation.” Policy makers and environmental managers therefore need to

be informed about the impact of certain strategies.

Efforts to improve the water quality in Manila Bay by reducing the organic and nutrient
loading from rivers may only be relevant to DO levels, initially, at the surface and upper
water layers. The importance of SOD points to the possible time lag in the response of water
quality to the effects of efforts to clean up the bay due to residual SOD (from old sediments).
DO/hypoxia clears up in the near-bottom waters in about 2 weeks with lower SOD which
means that the feature may not be permanent in Manila Bay. However, hypoxia is likely a
recurring phenomenon in the bay as seen in the field observations and as deduced from the
projections of nutrient loading from the watershed that may continue to increase despite

management interventions.

Unfortunately, SOD cannot easily be managed. Further research on the effects of historic
nutrient loading (that leads to high sediment oxygen demand) is important to understand
the magnitude and timing of recovery and rehabilitation of the water quality in Manila Bay
once reduction strategies (such as WWTPs) for nutrient and organic loading in the
watershed are in place. In Chesapeake Bay and Tokyo Bay, management interventions that
have been in place for decades have led to minimal improvements in water quality (Kubo et

al., 2018; Murphy et al., 2022). At the very least however, consistent efforts should be the


goal for the rehabilitation of Manila Bay. In addition, stricter policies on dredging and
dumping related to reclamation activities in the bay should be implemented as these can

affect the sediment oxygen demand dynamics and nutrient release via disturbance of
sediments,

DO levels improved after 14 days at the bay's head, throughout the water column, and at
the bottom due to decreased sediment oxygen demand. Low near-bottom DO clear up in
the middle of the bay after decreased sediment oxygen demand. DO levels at the rest of the
water column also improve. Near the mouth, surface DO levels improve with decreased
sediment oxygen demand. Factors such as bathymetry, proximity to rivers, and water
circulation lead to varying responses of DO levels in different areas of the bay. Shallow areas
at the northern coast (head of the bay) are quite susceptible to hypoxia due to their
proximity to rivers and the poor water flow. Reclamation projects that could increase the

sediment load into the bay and hinder water flow could further degrade the water quality in
these areas.

Figure 5.6. The annual nitrogen loading per sub-watershed (A) and (8) annual phosphorus loading per
sub-watershed.

A watershed model was also developed to understand the sources of pollution that drain
into the bay. The bay receives discharge from 4 major sub-watersheds with an aggregate
area of about 19,000 km? (Figure 5.6). The watershed model is a grid-based model with

statistical data, elevation, and land use maps as inputs that use coefficients and an elevation
model to calculate the nutrient loads that drain into the bay.

The watershed model showed that as much as 66% of the total nitrogen (TN) and 59% of
total phosphorus (TP) loading into Manila Bay are derived from point or domestic sources
while agriculture accounts for 22% of TN and 30% of TP. From the nutrient analysis


conducted during the field surveys, ammonium is, on average, about 50% of the total
inorganic nitrogen concentration in the bay. The total nitrogen and total phosphorus loading
values obtained from the nutrient load model (NLM) could not be disaggregated into its,
different components for use in the water quality model. However, the ammonium loading
from the water quality model and the total nitrogen loading predicted by NLM for all rivers
draining into Manila Bay are consistent (ammonium being about half of total nitrogen). The

same is true for the loading from the Pasig sub watershed from both models.

‘The work presented shows that domestic sources are the dominant source of nutrient load
in Manila Bay. Hence, efforts to improve the water quality and mitigate oxygen depletion
and hypoxia should focus on this sector utilizing strategies such as the improvement of
sewage systems and connection to pipes as well as upgrading wastewater treatment
facilities. The current sewage systems in place cannot keep up with the amount of waste
generated in the watershed. Plans to increase the sewerage connections and septic tanks

within the Manila Bay region may reduce the BOD and TP load by 35% in 2050 (NEDA, 2020).

Population projections indicate that the population may continue to grow, because of
expected migration into Metro Manila; consequently, nutrient loading from the domestic
sector may show a continued increase throughout the coming decades. Even with assumed
access of the total population to sewage systems and tertiary (advanced) wastewater
treatment, it still leads to a considerable increase in nutrient loading to Manila Bay.
Complementing this access to tertiary wastewater treatment with the decentralization of
densely populated Metro Manila urban areas (by making living outside of Metro Manila and
the immediate vicinity of the bay more attractive) will contribute to a slower rate of
projected increase in nutrient loads. However, in all scenarios, there will be a further

increase, which means that oxygen depletion and hypoxia will worsen and possibly also
expand.

Aban on phosphorus-based detergents could help decrease phosphorus loads almost as
much as tertiary treatment but at a lesser cost of implementation. This strategy is a low-cost
option to reduce phosphorus loading into the environment before investing in tertiary

sewage treatment systems or as the sewage systems in place are upgraded.


Sub-watersheds and provinces differ in their nutrient loading characteristics; policies and
rehabilitation efforts can therefore be on a per province or per sub-watershed format to
consolidate and unify target issues and goals. For example, certain provinces can be targeted
for better waste management of animal waste or fertilizer waste, while in other regions the
focus should be on wastewater management. The nutrient load model presented an
overview of the dynamics of nutrient loading into Manila Bay and its sources in the
watershed and shows how the different facets of the nutrient loading problem can be

addressed by specific load reduction strategies.

According to NEDA’s Manila Bay Sustainable Development Master Plan (MBSDMP), “the
degradation of Manila Bay, in both land and water, is expected to worsen in the upcoming
years if things remain ‘business as usual’ including the present enforcement of and
compliance to policies and programs.” The pressure on the Manila Bay ecosystem remains,
especially with the projected population growth rate and continued development and

investment in Metro Manila despite government interventions and other rehabilitation
programs (NEDA, 2020).

Approved and funded interventions for the rehabilitation of Manila Bay include the
Operational Plan for the Manila Bay Coastal Strategy (work by MBCO), sewerage and
treatment projects by Maynilad and Manila Water, national-level IEC on solid waste

management (DENR), various Philippine Development Plan (PDP) projects, and various
acti

ies led by LGUs including disaster risk reduction (DRR) and fisheries projects (NEDA,
2020). There are multiple provisions for Manila Bay already in place, but aside from the
complicated ecological and environmental scale of the Manila Bay ecosystem which can
always be extensively studied, the bigger problem lies with the implementation and

compliance of the existing environmental laws and policies.

The field and modeling studies conducted in this research are a step toward understanding
the ecosystem of Manila Bay. The hydrodynamic model shows how changing nutrient
loading impacts oxygen depletion. The spatially explicit modeling of loading sources using
scenarios helps to design strategies focused on specific areas where mitigation can be most
cost-effective.


Although the approaches used have limitations, they proved to be useful for interpreting
results from field studies, understanding some factors that affect oxygen depletion, and for
evaluating different policies that are geared towards improving the status of the Bay in

terms of water quality.

Future research efforts about Manila Bay can prioritize several key directions to enhance the
understanding of this complex ecosystem. Temporally and spatially extensive field surveys,
coupled with continuous monitoring data, should be a cornerstone of research initiatives
integrated with a comprehensive database. in addition to consolidating the efforts of
different agencies, this database should also aim to harmonize methodologies and perform

quality control measures to ensure the reliability of monitoring data.

Time series of river discharge inputs and water flow data in the bay will improve the
hydrodynamic model and additional laboratory work is needed to address biogeochemical
limitations in the current modeling approach. This will also improve the forecasting abilities
of the models. An explicit sediment transport model should also be integrated into research
frameworks to better capture the sediment dynamics within the bay. Also, the contribution
of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), which was observed at the western coast of

Manila Bay near Bataan, should be investigated.

Efforts should also be directed towards increasing the capacity of LGUs to conduct
monitoring work effectively. This involves providing training and resources to ensure proper

data collection and analysis.

Lastly, the scope of scenario building should be expanded to further identify key areas in the
bay and its watershed that can be targeted by more aggressive rehabilitation measures.
Basic and comprehensive research in addition to proper implementation of laws and policies
are ultimately the keys to supporting the sustainable management and rehabilitation of
Manila Bay.
