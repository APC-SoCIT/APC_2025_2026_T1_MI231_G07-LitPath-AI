Abstract

Determining whether two uniserial modules over an Artin algebra are isomor-
phic is an open problem in representation theory. However, isomorphism is a
very strong condition. If the interest is to translate a first-order theorem in one
module to another, it suffices to consider weaker notions such as elementary equiv-
alence. The thesis investigates a particular class of uniserial modules over a ring.
In particular, it will be shown that if the ring is infinite, simple and von Neu-
mann regular, then the theory of modules over this ring has elementary equivalent
models. An application of this result is given. Conversely, it is shown that with
the assumption that every ideal of the ring is an elementary substructure of the
ring as a module over itself, we have that the ring must be infinite, simple and
von Neumann regular. It is also shown that the prescribed conditions are strictly
insufficient for isomorphism. The thesis will include a discussion of preliminary concepts and known theorems that leads to the main results.

Chapter 1

Introduction

Twentieth century foundational mathematics was concerned with pinning down a
structure uniquely by a set of axioms. One of the known attempts was Peano’s
axioms for natural numbers. The first-order Peano axioms turned out to have
nonstandard models i.e. models that are not isomorphic to the standard natural
numbers. To uniquely capture the natural numbers up to isomorphism, we need

second-order logic.

The theory of modules, unlike theories like Peano’s, was intended to capture
a large class of structures. Thus it is expected for certain modules to be non-
isomorphic. Nevertheless, determining when two structures are isomorphic is a
natural and often useful result. For isomorphic structures, most theorems that
hold in one structure hold in the other. Indeed, there is an agreement among
mathematicians that isomorphic structures are essentially the same. Properties
of one structure that are not invariant under isomorphism are often referred to as
evil by category theorists. This leads to the question of how fine or coarse our
condition must be for isomorphism, that is, the question of which properties are
irrelevant in some sense. To give an example, the von Neumann ordinal definition
of natural numbers and Zermelo’s definition satisfy the same universal property of
being a natural numbers object [17, p.269]. But in the von Neumann definition,
5 € 10 while 5 ¢ 10 in Zermelo ordinals.

To formalize the idea that isomorphic structures are the same, Makkai [5] pro-
posed the following principle of isomorphism: all grammatically correct properties
of an objects of a fixed category are invariant under categorical isomorphism. By
categorical isomorphism we mean the following: Objects A and B in a category are
isomorphic if there exist f : A B and g: B > A such that go f is the identity
arrow in A and f og is the identity arrow in B. It is clear that the above princi-
ple is referencing all categorical properties and so is not itself a statement within
the object language of category theory. Foundational mathematicians formalize
this idea (in general) as the univalence axiom in homotopy type theory to have a

foundation that is more consistent with how mathematicians do mathematics.

Finding a method for deciding whether two uniserial modules over an Artin
algebra are isomorphic is an open problem posed in [2]. A uniserial module is a
module whose submodules are totally ordered by inclusion. An Artin algebra is
an algebra over a commutative Artinian ring R that is finitely generated as an
R-module. There are partial results that tackle this problem. In [3], it was shown
by D’Este, Kaynara and Tiitiincii that for uniserial modules 1 and A/ of finite

length over any ring R, the following are equivalent:
1L2M

2. There are morphisms f : L — M and g: M — L and nonzero x € L such

that z is a fixed point of go f.

3. There are morphisms f),..., f, with f; : LM, fo: ML, fg: Lo M.,...
such that f,o...0 f; #0.

By uniform module we mean a module such that the intersection of any two
nonzero submodules is nonzero. Every uniserial module is uniform, for given
nonzero submodules U and V of a uniserial module A/, either U C V or V CU
and so their intersection is either U or V. The result above gives an approach to

decide when two uniserial modules are isomorphic.

In 2006, Prihoda showed that uniserial modules U and V over any ring R are
isomorphic if and only if there is a monomorphism f : U > V and an epimorphism
g:U—-V [6]. There are also results that borrow methods from algebraic geom-
etry. In particular, Huisgen-Zimmerman in 1998 [8] considered finite dimensional
algebras over algebraically closed fields [8]. Bongartz and Zimmerman continued

in this direction in 2001 [9].

The above open problem gives a motivation to consider a weaker form of equiv-
alence. One of the main implications of isomorphism is first-order logic invariance.
However, isomorphism is still a very strong condition. If a working mathematician
seeks to translate a first-order statement in one module to another, it suffices to
consider a weaker form of equivalence which precisely describes what we mean by

first-order logic invariance.

The objectives of the thesis are the following:


1. Provide a clear exposition of the model-completeness of the theory of mod-

ules over an infinite, simple, von Neumann regular ring.

2. Prove that uniserial modules over an infinite, simple, von Neumann regular
ring are unique up to elementary equivalence and show that the converse is

true for a particular case.

3. Provide an application of the above result (2) when the ring R is a matrix

ring over a division ring.

Chapter 2 gives an overview of model theory. Chapter 3 covers the first. ob-
jective and is composed of known results mainly but not exclusively found in [1]
with some proofs provided to elucidate the ideas and techniques. Chapter 4 in-
cludes the main results (objectives 2 and 3) and we also show why the prescribed

assumptions are insufficient for isomorphism.

Chapter 2

Model theory

In [4], Weiss stated that model theory is the part of mathematics which shows how
to apply logic to the study of structures in pure mathematics. Furthermore, he
claimed that the fundamental tenet of model theory is that mathematical truth,
like all truth, is relative. By this he means that truth is relative to a model,
which is a structure satisfying a set of axioms. In this chapter, we introduce the
preliminary notions of model theory and how it can play a role in the study of

abstract algebra.

2.1 First-order theories and structures

We adopt the conventions in [7, p.14]. A (first-order) language a has the following

as its symbols:
1. Variables x, y, z,... (of some type)
2. The symbols 7, 3 and V

3. Function and predicate symbols { fx}xex and {P;}ie7 respectively, each of

which has a corresponding natural number called its arity.

We consider constants in a as a 0-ary function symbol. Any function symbol and
predicate symbol (other than =) are considered nonlogical symbols. We recursively

define the formulas in a as follows:

1. x = y is a formula for some <x and y in S (not necessarily distinct).

2. P(x1,...,tn) where P is a predicate in a of arity n and 2), ..., are variables

in S (not necessarily distinct).
3. The disjunction of any two formulas is a formula.
4. The negation of a formula is a formula.

5. Expressions of form 3z ¢(x) where ¢ is a formula constructed from (1) to

(4) above.

A sentence is a formula with no free variables. We call formulas of form (1) and
(2) atomic. The reason why they are called atomic is that any other formulas are
built upon them as we see from the above recursive definition. It is thus natural
in the field of mathematical logic to prove things about all formulas by induction
on the recursive definition. A first-order language is a formal language in which

the symbols and formulas are as described above.

Given a language a, an a-structure A/ is a nonempty set M (called the universe
of AJ) with a subset M|P,] C M™ for every predicate symbol P, (except the logical
symbol =) and an n-ary function f : M — M for each n-ary function symbol f.
When the context is clear, we may write M instead of M.

Suppose M is an a-structure and ¢, w are formulas in language a with free
variables x1,...,%,. Given aj,...,@, € M we can recursively define the relation

M F ¢(a),..., Qn) (reads as M models ¢(aj,...,@n)) by induction on ¢:
1. If ¢ is the formula x; = x; then M F $(a;,a;) if and only if a; = a;.
2. If ¢ = P(xj,,...,2;,) then M F (a,...,@,) if and only if the n-tuple
(aj,,-.-,@;,) € M[P].
3. ME (dV W)(ay,..., Qn) if and only if MF (a,...,@n) or MF (ay, ..., An).

4. ME -7¢(aj,...,@n) if and only if it is not the case that MF ¢(a),....an).

5. If ¢ is of form (Sy) where ~ has free variables 2,...,2n,y, then Af F
(a1, ...,@n) if and only if there is a b € M such that M F (aj, ...,@n.b).

A first-order theory T is a formal system such that the language of T is first-
order, the axioms of T are the logical axioms (which are intrinsic to all theories)
and the nonlogical axioms.

The theorems of T are recursively defined as follows:
1. Axioms of T are theorems of T.
2. Logical consequences of axioms of T are theorems of T.

We write T + ¢ to mean that ¢ is a theorem of T (or ¢ is provable in T). In-
deed, a first-order theory is completely determined by its nonlogical symbols and
nonlogical axioms. The rules of inference, axioms and symbols are already given

once we have chosen a language for our (classical) theory. The rules of inference

may differ if we want theorems to be constructively valid. But for our purposes,
we assume the background logic is classical.

A set-model or simply a model of a theory T is an a—structure M such that M
models the axioms of T. Indeed, a model is functorial (see [5]) and we can gen-
eralize the definition of models to models in a suitable category. The theory and
results that arise out of the category-theoretic study of model theory is interesting
but is not of great relevance in our discussion of modules as modules are models

valued in sets.

To give examples, the theory T,4g of abelian groups has only one nonlogical
symbol ¥ which is a binary function symbol. The nonlogical axioms of T4g are
the following:

e ABI VrVyV2(z *y) *z = 2¥*(y*2z)

e AB2 3x((Vy(x * y = y)) AVysd2(z *y =2))

© AB3 VaVy(z * y = y * 2).

Models of the theory Tp are precisely the abelian groups.
The theory Tacr, of algebraically closed fields of characteristic p is in the language
of fields. The nonlogical axioms of ACF, are the following:

e ACF1 The ficld axioms

e ACF2 lp=p

e ACF3 (Vapo, ..., dndt)(Qnz” + ... + ax + ag = 0) (One axiom for each

natural number 7).
The third axiom ACF$3 is an axiom schema expressing algebraic closure.
The theory T of right R-modules is written in the language of abelian groups
together with a unary operation r for each element of R (elements of R are treated
as endomorphisms of the module). For a structure Mf to be an R-module, we
require that the ring R is unital, (Af, +) to be a model of T,4z, and the following
axioms must be satisfied:

e M1 (a+b)r =ar+br

e M2 a(r+s) =ar+as

e M8 a(rs) = (ar)s

e M4al=a.

That is, we also assume modules are unital. Given a theory T, write TF ¢ to

mean that every model of T models ¢ (semantic consequence).

We note that a theory is not uniquely presented. For instance, the theory
Tag of abelian groups can be presented with an additional constant symbol 1 and
axiom AB2 replaced by the sentence Vy(1 * y = y) A Wzdz'(z' * z = 1). We call
this new theory T4g’. The theories T4g and T4,) are equivalent in the sense that
the axioms of T4g are theorems of Tg vice versa. This is the same as claiming
their class of models are the same (or their syntactic categories are equivalent
categories. See [5, Lecture 1 p.5]). Indeed, instead of considering an element of a
ring R to be an endomorphism of an R-module, the theory of modules T can also
be presented as a multisorted theory by treating an element of R to be a variable
of another type. However, the former presentation is more convenient for model
theory.

We also define the theory associated to a particular structure M as
Th(M) = {¢: M F 4}

which is the collection of all sentences in the language of A/ that are true in M.

A theory T is called syntactically complete if for every sentence ¢ in T, either
Tt gor Ti -7¢. The theory Th(M) is syntactically complete for any particular
M but the theory of a large class of structures is not always so. For instance,
the theory of groups Tg is not syntactically complete. To see this, we just make
the observation that some groups are abelian and some are not. Hence both the

statement ab = ba and its negation are not theorems of Tg.

2.2 The morphisms in model theory

In modern algebra, we say that homomorphisms are structure-preserving. Indeed,
structure-preserving is a model-theoretic concept. Thus the model-theoretic def-
inition of homomorphism covers all such cases. Let (7 denote the universe of a
structure M. A function h.: Mf > N is a homomorphism if for all ¢ such that ¢

is atomic (that is, of the form x = y or P(x,...,,) for P a predicate),
ME @(qj,...,@n) => NE O(h(ay),..., h(@n)).

where aj,...,@, € M.
In particular, a homomorphism of groups corresponds to a homomorphism of

models A and B where A and B are groups (models of the theory of groups).

To illustrate this, suppose that in .4, ¢(a,b,c) defined as a + 6 = c holds ie.
AFa+b=c. If f is a group homomorphism f : A > B, then f(a +b) =
f(a) + f(b) = f(c) in B that is, BE f(¢(a,b,c)).

If M and N are models of theory T and M C N then we say there is an
embedding from 7 to N. We call N a supermodel of M. An embedding is
called elementary if [(M) is an elementary substructure of N. By saying is an
elementary substructure of N (equivalently N is an elementary extension of M)

we mean that for any n-ary formula ¢ in the formal language,

Vay, -;0n € M, MF d(ay,...,an) <=> NE $(a},..., dn).

A theory is called model complete if all its embeddings are elementary.

The following example of the usefulness of model completeness is known in
classical algebraic geometry as discussed in [4, p.39]. It is known that the theory
of algebraically closed fields Tacr (Tacr, without the axiom ACF2) is model
complete. We also assume a weaker version of the axiom of choice so that every

field has an algebraic closure. From these, we get a fundamental result:

Theorem 2.1. (Hilbert Nullstellensatz.) If K is an algebraically closed field
and / a proper ideal of K[z,..., tn], then

V(1) = {we A'(K) : (WF € T)(f (4) = 0)} 40.
That is, da;,...,@, € K such that Vf E 7 , f(ai,...,an) = 0.

Proof. If K is a field (hence noetherian) then by Hilbert Basis Theorem, the ring
K[xy, ..., Zn] is noetherian and every ideal of K (1, ..., Zn] is finitely generated. Let
fi, +) fm generate I. If M is a maximal ideal containing J then K[x1, ...,tn]/M isa
field with K C K[x),...,2n]/M. Let F be the algebraic closure of K[2,...,.tn]/M
so we have a tower of fields K C K[x,...,2n]/M C F where F F ACF and
KF ACF. So K C Fis an embedding of models. Now for p = (11+ M,...,.tn +M)
€ {K[z,...,2n]/M}" © F", we have that fi(u) = ... = fa(u) =0. Let c,...,c) €
F be the coefficients defining f),..., fm then

Si(ue) = 0).

PE (er, ---5 Cp) = (Se)(

I


Since the theory of algebraically closed fields is model complete, the embedding

K C F of models is elementary. Thus we have

KE B(e4 509) = GH) A\ False) = 0).
k=1

So there is w € K” such that fi(u) =... = fn(u) = 0 but f)..... fm generates J so
Vf € J, f(u) =0. Therefore the vanishing set of J contains y (That is, V(J) is
nonempty). Oo

We now discuss the notion of sameness with respect to first-order logic. Struc-
tures Af and N are elementary equivalent (denoted Mf = N) if for all sentences ¢
in the language,

ME¢o => NF¢®.

An isomorphism of models implies elementary equivalence. Elementary equiv-
alence, while weaker, is also desirable as it allows the translation of first-order
statements in one structure to the other. For instance, any two real closed fields
are elementary equivalent. This allows us to extend the field of real numbers to

any hyperreal field with infinitesimals while preserivng all first-order logic.

2.3. A fundamental theorem

The relation T + ¢ speaks of formal provability, while the relation T F ¢ is about
semantics. It is natural to ask if they are related. If a sentence is provable then it
holds for all models (this is called soundness). The proof is just the verification that
the derivation rules in the theory indeed preserves truth. An infamous theorem of
Gédel (his doctoral dissertation) tells us that as long as we restrict our models to
the category of sets, the converse holds. That is, if a sentence holds in all models
of the theory then it must be a theorem. Therefore the notions + and - are the

same in first-order logic.

Theorem 2.2. (Godel Completeness Theorem.) Let T be a first-order theory.
ThenTE@ => Te.

We note that a theory T is syntactically complete if and only if any two models

of T are elementary equivalent. To see this, suppose all models of T are elementary


equivalent. Then for any sentence ¢, either M — ¢ or M |: -¢ for any model M
of T and so by the Completeness Theorem either M+ ¢ or M+ 7¢. The converse

is clear since if a sentence is provable, it must hold for all models.


Chapter 3

Elimination of quantifiers

As we have discussed, the model completeness of theory of algebraically closed
fields T4cr gives a simpler proof of Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz. This property comes
from the fact that the theory T4cr has elimination of quantifiers. Now a formula
is a boolean combination of formulas in a set S if ¢ can be obtained by disjunction,
conjunction and negation of formulas in S. By elimination of quantifiers we mean
that for every formula $(21,...,2,) of a theory T there corresponds a boolean

combination of atomic formulas A(x), ..., Zn) such that
TH (Vay,...,2n)(O(21,...,2n) A(T, ...,2n)).

Note that every quantifier-free formula is just a boolean combination of atomic

formulas.

It is well-known that model theory is heavily utilized in the study of algebraic
geometry. The model theory of modules turns out to be more complicated because
we do not have a full climination of quantifiers, but only elimination restricted to

a particular class of formulas. We will discuss these formulas later in this chapter.

We note that the property of having quantifier elimination of a theory T is inde-
pendent of the syntactic completeness of T. Consider the structure M = (N, S)
which models the Peano axioms where S is the unary successor function. Let
Th(M) denote the associated theory to M i.e. the collection of all first-order
statements in the language of M that hold in M. By definition, Th(M) is syntac-

tically complete. But the elementary formulas of Th(M) are just of form
S*(x) = S'(z)

for some k,l € No. Since the successor function is injective, the above equation
can be rewritten as

S"(a) =2 (*)
for some n € No. But z is a fixed point of S” if and only if n = 0 since the

successor of any natural number is not 0. And so the above relation reduces


to x = x which tells us that the given quantifier-free formula defines the entire
universe N. If n > 1 then no natural numbers satisfies the relation (*). Thus every
atomic formula defines either the empty set or the entire universe. Therefore, any
quantifier free formula defines either the empty set or the entire universe. Notice
however that the set {0,1} is definable by the formula Vz S?(r) # z. So it cannot
be the case that

Th(M) + Vy(Wa(S?() ¢ y) © A(y))

where A(x) is any boolean combination of atomic formulas. Thus Th(M) is a

complete theory without quantifier elimination.

Now by the Gédel Completeness Theorem, the theory of algebraically closed fields
ACF cannot be complete since there arc ficlds of different characteristic. Yet it is

well known to have elimination of quantifiers.

3.1 Positive primitive formulas

We now define what we mean by a positive primitive formula. The definition we

will use is due to Prest (1, Chapter 2].

A formula $(v,..., Un) is positive primitive if it is equivalent modulo the theory T

of modules over R to a formula of form

mon N
Jw, Wn OS vir + So weskj = 0)
k=1

j=l i=l

where r;; and s,; are in ring R. That is,

m n N
TF (v1, ..-;Un) @ Jw, Wn KO iris + So wes = 0).

j=l i=1 k=1

In terms of matrices we can write the RHS of the material equivalence as

Th Tim
Trl Tram
Jw), ..., Wn [V1...UnW1...wy] =0 (3.1)
$11 Sim
SN1 SNm


where 0 is the zero matrix of correct size.

If we consider the block decomposition of the matrix above, we can rewrite

(3.1) as

dwy, ..., wy ([01..-¥n] P = —[wy...-wy]Q).

We have discussed modules as a model in the previous chapter. By definition, the
atomic formulas of the theory of modules over R must be of form 0 = 0 (since 0

is the only constant symbol) or (if in n free variables)

n
) UiT ig =0
i=1

where the v; are free variables. Hence a positive primitive formula is really just a

formula of the form

dw), wn ((\ Ai)
i=l

where the A; are atomic formulas.

Let M be a module over R. An example of a positive primitive formula is the
divisibility condition. Let r € R and ¢(v) := dx(v = zr). The formula ¢(v) is
positive primitive and MF ¢(a) <=> a is divisible by r in M.

The following theorems can be found in [1, Chapter 2.1]. For simplicity, we write

U1, +++) Un AS V.

Lemma 3.1. (Linearity of positive primitive formulas.) Given @ and b in M
for some module M and a positive primitive formula $(v) the followng hold: a

positive-primitive formula (0) the following hold:
1. ¢(0)
2. o(@) and 6(b) => 6(a— b)
3. Suppose r is in the center of R. Then $(@) => ¢(a@r) where (Gr) is
$(a1T, ..., nt)
Proof. Since ¢ is positive primitive, ¢(0) is equivalent to
mi on N
du, B00%) w AQ? Ori; + So wes = 0)
j=l i=] k=1


where rj; and s,; are in the ring R. And so is of form

m N
du, On [\ (D> weseg oS 0).

j=l k=1
It is an axiom of the theory of modules that the zero element exists for any module
M over R. So for any R-module M, we have M - (0) for any positive primitive

formula ¢.

Suppose $(@) and ¢(b). Then

m n N
dw, wn \(d> ari + So wesk; =0)

j=l i=l k=1

and

3n,..av /\( Soin + Ysy =0).

j=l i=1
But since this is so,

mon N
du), ..., uv [\O 2 (a: — bi) rij + S- UkSkj = 0).
j=l i=l k=1

where uz = we — gz. Hence ¢(a — 8).
Suppose that r is in the center of Ri.e. Vy € R(rg = gr) and suppose ¢(a).

We want to show that
duy,..., uv A(X ayr)rij + Yuen = = 0).
j=l i=1

but since r is in the center of R, the above formula is equivalent to

Fu, ..., uv AT ajriz)t + Yvusy = = 0).

j=l i=l
Since $(a@), we have

Fw1,--.; THINODE Tis + Yay = = 0).

j=l i=1
Applying the operation r € R in both sides news

dwy,... ov AT ajrig)T + i (wisej)r = 0).

j=l i=1

Since r is in the center of R,

N
Jw), ... sun \( 5 a;ri)T + So (wer) se; = 0).
k=1

j=l i=1

Hence we can choose the uz to be wzr. oO


Corollary 3.2. Let ¢ be a positive primitive formula with free variables 0 and let

| be the length of the free variables 0. Let M be a module over R.

1. @(M) = {a € M': M F ¢(@)} is @ subgroup of M!' called the positive-
primitive definable subgroup of AI.

2. For fixed @, substitute @ to the last |—k-free variables inv. The set ¢(M,@) =
{ce M*: M - ¢(2,a)} is either empty or is a coset of the subgroup ¢(M,0)
of M*.

Proof. The set ¢(M) contains 0 by Lemma 3.1. By-the subgroup test, it remains
to check if @ — b is in ¢(M). Suppose that @ and 6 are in ¢(M) that is, M  ¢(a)
and M | ¢(b) then by Lemma 3.1, M | ¢(@ — b) and so @— bis in ¢(M)

By Lemma 3.1, ¢(M,0) is a subgroup of M*. Suppose ¢(/,@) is nonempty
and suppose Zc’ € ¢(M,a). Thus M § ¢(¢,a@) and M - ¢(¢,a). By Lemma 3.1,
we have M — ¢(¢-¢,,0). Hence C € €+ 4(M,0) ie. o(M,a) C + ¢(M,0).
Conversely, suppose po € ¢(A/,0). So we have M — $(@,0) and M § 4(Z,a).
Since $(A/,0) is a group, —@ € ¢(M,0). Hence by Lemma 3.1 M § ¢(é + %, a)
ie. €+ 6(M,0) C A(A/,2). oO

In model theory, a type is a set of first-order formulas in the language with
n-free variables that holds for a set of n-tuples in the universe of the structure.

Formally, the type of a tuple @ in a model M is the set of formulas
tp™ (a) = {(@) : M — 6(@)}.
For definition with parameters from BC M we have
tp” (G/B) = {9(0,) : be B,M F 4(@,6)}.

We can restrict this definition to positive primitve formulas. The following
definitions are due to Prest [1, p.22-34].

If € M and if S C M, we define the positive primitive type of ¢ in M over S
to be the filter consisting of those cosets ( positive primitive-definable over S ) to

which the tuple ¢ belongs. We denote this by
pp™ (6/S) = {¢(5,3) : 3 € S,MF o(Z,5)}

where ¢ is a positive primitive formula. If S = @ , we write pp™ (c).

Given a homomorphism f : 1f > N and @ in M, if M §& ¢(@) where @ is
positive primitive, then N F ¢(fa). Thus the positive primitive-type of @ in M is

contained in the positive primitive-type of fa in N. That is,

pp™ (a) pp (fa).

So if Af C N, where M and N are modules over R, and if @ is in M, choosing f

to be the inclusion mapping yields
pp™ (a) C pp™ (a).

The above embedding M C N of models is called a pure embedding if for every
a € M, we have equality
pp (@) = pp" (a).
We write M <«< N to mean there is a pure embedding of M to N (M is a pure
submodule of NV). Indeed M < N if and only if for all positive primitive-formula
¢ and tuples a in M,
MF ¢(a) <> NE ¢@).

That is to say, a pure embedding is a positive primitive elementary embedding (¢
is restricted to positive primitive formulas). In a more concrete sense, what we
mean is that every finite system of linear equations with coefficients from the ring
R and parameters from the module M that has solutions in N in fact already has

solutions in M.

The idea of a pure embedding leads to the notion of a von Neumann regular
ring. A ring F is called von Neumann regular if every embedding of R-modules
is a pure embedding. There are many characterizations of von Neumann regular

rings, one of which is given in [12]: R is von Neumann regular if and only if
Vraz :rar=r

where r,z € R.

We now introduce invariant statements. The following definition is due to
Prest [1, p.34]. Let M be an R-module and 4, A be positive primitive with the

same free variables such that ¢ implies A. Define
Inv(M, ¢,) = |6(M)/A(M)|


to be the order of the factor group ¢(M/)/A(M). If it is not the case that ¢ implies

A then we define:
Inv(M. 6,2) = |6(M)/(o(M) 9 X(M))|.

Note that Inv(M, ¢, A) = Inv(M, ¢, {6 A A}). Indeed for k a positive integer,
k
Inv(M,9.r) >k => ME Vj,...,%30(6(0) A \ >A - HH). (3.2)
i=]

Note that =A(v —%) if and only if 0 — 7%; is not in A(M) and this is so if and only if
the equivalence classes are not equal i.e. [vu] # [v;] for i < k and since the formula
in RHS of (3.2) requires that ¢(v) holds for some 0, the factor module would have
more than k elements.

For k a positive integer, we also define
Inv(-, ¢,A) =k := Inv(-,¢,A) > kA7Inv(-,¢,A) >k+1

Invariants of direct sum or product of modules are the products of its components.
See [1, Lemma 2.10]. In particular, Inu(M@N, ¢, W) = Inv(M, ¢, v)Inv(N, ¢, v).

If T is a syntactically complete theory of modules over R, then every two
models of T are elementary equivalent. Thus Inu(M, ¢, A) = Inv(N, ¢, A) for any
model M and N of T. Therefore if T is complete, we can write Inv(T, ¢, A) to
mean Inu(M,¢, ) where M is an arbitrary model of T.

The notion of invariants gives rise to a standard partial ordering of syntactically
complete theories of modules. Let T and T’ be syntactically complete theories of
modules, we write T < T’ if each model of T is purely embedded into some model
of T’. Indeed by Proposition 2.30 in [1, p.60], the above condition is equivalent to
saying Inv(T,¢,A) < Inv(T’,¢, A) for all positive primitive formulas ¢ and A in

one free variable. Define

T* = Th(Q Mr)
where T is a syntactically complete theory of modules and Mr a representative
model of T. That is to say, T* is the syntactically complete theory of the direct sum
of all representative models of every syntactically complete theory T of modules.
With respect to the above partial ordering we defined, this is by definition the

largest syntactically complete theory of modules.


A module M models T™ if for every positive primitive formulas ¢ and w with
y — 4, the invariant Inv(M, ¢. V) is infinite i.e. 6(M)/w(M) is infinite. See [11,
p.17]. Thus if M is not a model of T*, Inv(M,¢, V) is finite for every pair of

positive primitive formulas ¢ and w.

It will turn out that every sentence in the language of modules is equivalent
(modulo the theory of modules) to a boolean combination of conditions on positive
primitive formulas and invariants i.e. those statements of form Inv(T, ¢, A) being

equal, less, or greater than some positive integer k.

3.2 Model completeness

In this section, our main goal is to show that the theory of R-modules is model

complete if and only if A is an infinite, simple, von Neumann regular ring

The proof of the following lemma is found in [13, p140-141]. This lemma general-
izes a result of B.H. Neumann that will be used to prove the relative elimination

of quantifiers for module theory.

Lemma 3.3. Let G be a group, and let Ho, ..., Hn, be subgroups of G, ao, ...,; An—1 €
G, and M = {Hoao,..., Hn-1@n-1} Suppose that

n-1
G= U Hya;
i=0

but G is not the union of any proper subset of M. Then [G : ();., Hi] < n! and
so by Lagrange’s theorem each H; is of finite index in G and one may omit from

any covering of cosets of G cosets of the form Ha if |G: H] > nl.
Proof. Let H =();<, Hi. We will show that for each j <n
[H;: H]<(n-1)!

For if this is the case, each coset Hja; is the union of at most (n — 1)! cosets of H
and so G is a union of at most n! cosets which is what we want. This claim follows
from the case m = 1 of the following statement: If 1 < m < nand Ko,..., Km-1 are
Ho), »--» Him—1) for some i(0) < ... < i(m—1), then [KoN...AKm-—1: H] < (n—m)!.
We prove the above statement by (downward) induction on m. If m = n we

are done. Thus suppose that the above statement holds for m + 1 and suppose


Ko,..-, Km-1 are groups in the hypothesis of the statement. Let K = Nem Ki.
Since G is not the union of any proper subset of M (i.e. M is a minimal cover)
there is an element g € G not in U;<_ Hicjaig) and so for each j < m, Hij)aiV3)
is disjoint from the coset Hj;)g and hence disjoint from Kg so that Hijyax;)97?

is disjoint from K.

Consider any i < n. The set KM (Ij;a;:g~!) is either empty (if i = i(j) for
some j) or a coset (K M H;)y; since if K M (H,a;g~') # 0, then the elements
of K in the intersection are of the form hja;g~! where h; € H;. So we have
KM (Hiaig~') = (KN H;)aig7! where aig! € G. Thus K is the union of at most
n—m cosets (KM H;)y; each of which is, by inductive hypothesis, the union of at

most (n —_m — 1)! cosets of H. This proves our claim and the lemma. Oo
The following corollary is immediate:

Corollary 3.4. (B.H. Neumann’s Lemma) Given the assumptions of Lemma 3.3,
any coset of a subgroup of infinite index may be omitted. That is, if Ho, ...,H, are

subgroups of G and
k
G=|JHia
i=0

with Ho,....Hm (m < k) subgroups with indices in G greater than n! then

k

i=m+1
We now discuss the usual techniques for quantifier elimination. A formula ¢

is called primitive existential if
=a /\ po (3.3)
I

where each p; are basic formulas. By basic formulas we mean an atomic formula

or a negation of atomic formula.

To show that T has elimination of quantifiers, it suffices to show that we can
eliminate the existential quantifier in (3.3). The same holds if we change the con-
dition on p; to be a formula of certain form. That is, if each p; is positive primitive
or a negation of a positive primitive formula, then to show that every formula is
a boolean combination of positive primitive formulas and invariant sentences, it

suffices to show that every formula of form (3.3) where each p; is positive primitive


is equivalent to a boolean combination of positive primitive formulas and invariant

sentences. See (15, Lemma 3.2.4].

We also note that a formula ¢(v) can be identified with the set of all tuples a
in a module M such that M - ¢(@) since the sets:

{ae M: Mi ¢(a)}

{aeM: ME y(a)}
are equal if and only if M — Vu(¢(v) © y()).

The following results up to Theorem 3.12 are known. See [1, Chapter 2 and
16]. We provide the details of the proof.

Theorem 3.5. The theory T of R-modules has positive primitive and invariant
sentences (in one free variable) elimination of quantifiers. That is, every formula
in the language of modules is equivalent modulo T to a boolean combination of

invariant sentences (in one free variable) and positive primitive formulas.

Proof. By the Godel Completeness Theorem for first-order logic, it suffices to work
in an arbitrary module M. Suppose that the length of W is n and suppose that
w(v,W) is a boolean combination of positive primitive-formulas. Then 7(v,@) can
be expressed in disjunctive normal form (see [13, p.42]):

U(4;(0,) N( >i (v, 7)

j i
where $; and 7; are positive primitive since intersection of positive primitive-
formulas are positive primitive. To see this, we consider the prenex normal form
of the conjunction of two positive primitive formulas. Suppose we have two positive

primitive formulas:

N
Fwy, ..., ww AC y UiTig + ) WeSkj = 0)

j=l i=1 k=1

dn, -. cau \( Sac + Yon = =0)

j=l i=1

Then their conjunction is equivalent to the formula

M
dwy,... sry WN5Q1,- sau \D ViTig + Yay = = 0) A IN y TiC + So ade; = 0).

j=l i=1 j=l i=1 k=1


By renaming the variables this is just the formula

n+m nt+tm N+M

dw). vy WN4M \ (> Vili + > WkSkj = 0)
j=l i=l k=l

which is positive primitive. Therefore,
T + Bup(v,@) 4 Bv\/(9;(v,@) A \ Wis (v, B))
j i

and the RHS of the equivalence is equivalent to

V Ju(¢;(v, B) A \\ >Wij(v, 3).

j i
Thus it suffices to eliminate 3 from a formula of form

du(d(v, W) A \ aij (v, W))

where the 7; and ¢ are positive primitive-formulas.

Suppose that we are working in an arbitrary module M and v;(v,@) > $(v,@)
for each i. Then Vb € M, the formula (v,b) A A; 7¥i(v,b) defines the set
¢(M,6) ~ U,¥vi(M,6). Thus to eliminate the existential quantifier, we need to
express the condition ¢(M,b) ~ U, ¥i(M,b) 4 @ as a boolean combination of
positive primitive-formulas and invariants. Equivalently, we can express
o(M,b) ~ (J ¥i(AI, 6) (3.4)
i<n

as a boolean combination of positive primitive formulas and invariants. We note
that (3.4) is equivalent to the condition

o(M,b) ¢ (J di(M, 6). (3.5)

i<n
By Corollary 3.2, the set ¢(M,b) is empty or is a coset of (M,0) and ¥;(M,b)
is empty or a coset of y,(M/,0). If 6(M,b) = @ then (3.5) is true. If y,(M,6) = 0
then we will just remove it in the union. Thus we may assume that ¢(M/,b) and

all the y;(M,b) are nonempty.

Choose elements c, do, ...,dp—1 € M such that (M,b) = $;(M,0)c and y,(M, b) =
wi(M,0)d;. Let u; = dhe We can write condition (3.5) equivalently as


o(M,0) UJ wi(M, 0)ui. (3.6)
i<n
By Lemma 3.3, we may drop from the union cosets 7;(A/,0)u; whenever [@(A/, 0) :
¥,(M,0)] > n!. The statement [¢(A/,0) : ¥;(M.0)] < n! can be written as an in-
variant sentence. Suppose [$(M/, 0) : ~;(M,0)] < n! for each subgroup 7;(M,0).

We will show that the truth valuation of (3.6) is completely determined by the

following:

1. Invariants Inv(M, \(v, 0), u(v,0)) where A = ¢ or is a conjunction of some

y; and pz a conjunction of some yj.
2. Formulas of form 3u A; ¥i(v, 6).

Consider (); ¥i(A7,0). If S is a union of right cosets of (); ¥i(A/,0), define N(S)
to be the number of distinct cosets of (); 7):(7,0) lying in S. We have:

$(M,0) C Jdi(M,Dur <=> N(4(M.0)) < N(LJvi(M,Du). (3.7)

i<n i<n
By the inclusion-exclusion formula in combinatorics, the RHS of (3.7) is equivalent

to:

N(O(M,0)) < DO-IT DN) iM, O)wi)}. (3.8)

l<k<n JC{1,....n} ied
The set (),<) ¥i(M, 0)u; is either empty or a union of cosets of (), i(M,0). In the

latter case,

N(() ¥i(M, Dus) = [1 i(M,0) = () vien(M,0)].
ied ieJ i<n
By (3.8), we can write condition (3.6) as boolean combination of statements of

following forms:

L. [Mies PilM,D) : Nren Picn(M,0)] < p for some positive integer p. That is,
invariants Inv(M, A(v,0), (v,0)) in one free variable v where \ is a con-

junction of some 7); and py a conjunction of some yj.

2. Ney Vi(M, O)ui # 0.


The 2nd condition is equivalent to dv A, ¥;(v,b). But a conjunction of positive

primitive formulas is positive primitive. So Ju A, ¢i(v, 6) is positive primitive.

Therefore, there exists a formula o(@) (boolean combination of invariant state-
ments in one free variable and boolean combination of positive primitive formulas)

such that for any R-module J/,
M - Wo(30(4(v, 0) A A\ >¥i(v,B)) @ o(B)).

By the Gédel completeness theorem, we know that the above formula is indeed

provable in the theory T of modules over R. That is,

T + Vo(sv(d(v, @) A \ ayi(v,@)) & o(@)).

t

i)

It follows from Theorem 3.5. that every sentence in the language of modules is
a boolean combination of invariant sentences. This is because a positive primitive
sentence is satisfied by the zero element for any module M.

From the above result, if @,b € M for some module M, then
tp (a) = tp (b) <=> pp (a) = pp™(b).
That is, there is a positive primitive climination of quantifiers.
Corollary 3.6. The module M is elementary equivalent to N if and only if
Inv(M, ¢,¥) = Inv(N, ¢, ¥)
for all positive primitive formulas ¢ and w in one free variable where ¢ > w.

Proof. If M = N then Inv(M, ¢, ) = Inv(N, ¢,) since invariants are sentences

in the language of modules. The converse follows from Theorem 3.5. Oo

Lemma 3.7. Let Af,N be R-modules. If M « N, then
inv(N, ¢, ¥) = Inv(M], ¢, w) * Inv(N/M, ¢,¥)
for all ¢,w. So N is elementary equivalent to M ®(N/M). In particular,

Inv(M, ¢,¥) < Inv(N, ¢, ).


Proof. Suppose ¢ and wy are positive primitive formulas in n free variables. Since
M <«_N, we have ¢(M) = M"1M @(N). So we can form the quotient group
9(N)/¢(M). It suffices to show that

0(N)/O(M) = (N/M) (3.9)

for any positive primitive formula ¢. To see this, suppose we have (3.9). By

Lagrange’s theorem, we have

Inv(N, $b) _ (GN) ¥O)] _ ANDI ODI _ 16M)

Invo(M, 46.4) — (o(M): ¥(M)) |e) IIY(N)| N/M)
= [9(N)/O(M) : W(N)/¥(M)]
= [9(N)/O(M) : W(N)/¥(M1)]
= Inv(N/M,¢,%).

We proceed with the proof of (3.9). Elements of ¢(N)/¢(M) have the form a +
¢(M) where N — $(a). If @+ ¢(M1) € 6(N)/¢(M), then N — (a) and

N/M F $(na) = (4+ 6(M))
where 7 is the canonical epimorphism (projection):
m: O(N) > o(N)/o(M).
Hence ¢(N)/¢(M) < ¢(N/M). Now suppose that N/M  ¢(73) with
$(7a@) = JWA(D, 72)

where A is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Let b € N such that N/M —
(xb, 7G). Regard the zero element of each equation of \ as separate parameter,
that is, replace A(w,0) by Ao(w,v,0). Then N/M — o(w,v,0). Since Apo is a
conjunction of equations, by definition of factor module N/A/ there exists a ¢
in Kern = M such that N/M - 2o(b,a,¢). Thus N — 3W30\9(W, 7,2). Since
M «N and@eé M, M — 3w0)0(W, 7B, 7). Say a’ and U are in M with do(a’, V,2)
holds in N and M. Then by linearity of positive primitive formulas, from Ao(b, a, 2)
and Ag(b’,a’,e) we get Ao(b — b’,a — a’,0). In particular, N / 3wAo(w, a — a’, 0)
hence N  3wA(w,a— a’). That is to say, N — ¢(@—a’) but (a — a’)= 7 since
a’ € M = Kern. Therefore 7a € ¢(N)/¢(M/) as required.

That N is elementary equivalent to M @ (N/M) follows from Corollary 3.6. This

proves the lemma.
a)


Theorem 3.8. If M< N « M’ and M is elementary equivalent to M', then M

is an elementary substructure of N and N is an elementary substructure of M’

Proof. By Lemma 3.7, Inv(M, ¢,) < Inv(N,¢,) < Inv(M', 6, v) = Inv(M, ¢, Vv)
for any positive primitive-formulas ¢ and w thus M is elementary equivalent to N
(By Corollary 3.6).

Let a € AY. Since M <« N, pp™ (a) = pp (a). Hence tp” (a) = tp’ (@) and M

is an elementary substructure of N. O
The following corollary follows from Theorem 3.8. See [1, Corollary 2.26].

Corollary 3.9. Let M and N be R-modules. If A{ and N models the largest
theory T* and M « N then every embedding of M to N is elementary.

We now proceed to the results that give a sufficient and necessary condition

on aring R for a theory of modules over R to be model complete.

As mentioned earlier, there are many characterizations of von Neumann regular
rings. The definition we used is that a ring is von Neumann regular if every
embedding is a pure embedding. A particular characterization based on positive

primitive formulas is given in [14].
Theorem 3.10. Let R be a ring. The following are equivalent:
1. R is von Neumann regular.

2. If d is positive-primitive in n free variables, then there ezists ann x n idem-
potent matriz A with entries from R such that for any module M over R, the
pp-definable subgroup ¢(M) of M is the solution set to the matrix equation
vA =0 (i.e. the nullspace of A).

3. If If d is positive-primitive in n free variables, then there exists ann x n
idempotent matrix A with entries from ring R such that for any module M

over R, the subgroup ¢(M) is the solution set to matriz equation VA = ¥.

Thus by considering formulas in one free variable (class signs), we know that
for any module M over a von Neumann regular ring F, all positive primitive de-

finable subgroup of M is of the form Me for an idempotent e of R.

Using the characterization of von Neumann regular rings in Theorem 3.10, we

prove the following theorem:


Theorem 3.11. Suppose R is von Neumann regular and ¢, W positive primitive

formulas in one free variable. Then every Inv(—,¢,W) is equivalent to
Inv(-,v = vi,v = 0)

and alternatively to one of form Inv(—, vi = 0,uv = 0) where i is an idempotent of
R.

Proof. By the above characterization, every invariant is equivalent to one of form
Invu(—,v = ve,v = vf) where f and e are idempotents of R. Without loss of

generality suppose Re > Rf. We can decompose Re as:
Re = Rf © Re(1 — f).

We claim that e(1 — f) is an idempotent of R. Since R is not necessarily com-
mutative, it does not immediately follow that e(1 — f) is an idempotent. From
Re > Rf we have that f € Re. Hence, f = re for some r € R and so we have

fe=ree=re = f. Since fe= f,

e(1 — f)e(1 — f) = (e — fe)(e — fe) =(e- fy(e- f) =e — fe—fet+f

=e’ — fe=e—fe=e(1-—f).

Hence e(1 — f) is an idempotent of R.

Let Af be an R-module. The function © : Me —> Me(1—/f) defined by mapping
me € Me to the element me(1 — f) € Me(1 — f) is a group homomorphism since

for any me,ne € Me,
O(me + ne) = O((m+ n)e) = ((m+ n)e)(1 — f) = (me + ne)(1 — f)

=me—mef +ne—nef = me(1 — f) + ne(1 — f) = O(me) + O(ne).
By definition of ©, Im(©) = Me(1—/f). We claim that KerO=Mf. Ifmf € Mf,
then 0(mf) = mf(1—- f) = mf—mff = mf —mf = 0. So Mf C KerO.
Conversely, we want to show that if me € Ker®, then me € Mf. If me € KerO
(ie. if me(1— f) = 0), then me — mef = 0 and so me = mef. But since e € R,
it is an endomorphism of M. Thus we have me = mef € Mf and KerOC Mf.
Hence, we have KerO = Mf as desired.

By first isomorphism theorem for groups, we have:
Me/Mf = Me/KerO = ImO = Me(1 — f).


It follows that

|Me/M f| =|Me(1 — s)| =|Ae(1 — f)/{0}| = Inv(M, v = ve(1 — f). v = 0)

= Inv(M,v = vi, v = 0)

for some idempotent 7 of R. Therefore, the first form holds.

For every me € Me, me(1 — e) = me — me = 0. If m(1 — ec) = 0, then

m — me = 0 hence m = me. This shows that Me = anny(1 — e) and so the
second form follows.

i)

We now discuss the main theorem of this chapter. This theorem is known, and

we will use it to prove uniqueness up to elementary equivalence of certain modules.

Theorem 3.12. The theory of T of R-modules is model complete if and only if

the ring R is infinite, simple and von Neumann regular.

Proof. Suppose that the theory of modules over R is model complete. Then every
embedding between two nonzero R-module is elementary. We require the condition
nonzero” since otherwise by the universal property of the zero module (zero
object), the zero module would be elementary equivalent to a nonzero module,
which is absurd. Suppose that R is finite. Then R” is also finite for any positive
integer n. Since R embeds into R" for n > 2 such an embedding would be
elementary, so R = R”. We claim that elementary equivalent finite structures
have the same cardinality. Suppose M = N such that M and N finite and
|| =k. Since M has k elements,

MI k Ju, wey Uk NG # v;)
ifj
where i, 7 < k. So by elementary equivalence
N 3, ..., 0x [\(u; # 2)
tA
where i, 7 < k so |N| is at least k. Now suppose that
NE 3u,..., Up (ui # vj)
ifj
where p > k. Then by elementary equivalence
MF 3u, os Up [\(vi # vj)
ifj


This contradicts that |M| = k and thus |M| = |N|. Hence we have |R| = k = |R"|
for n > 2 where k is a positive integer; which is a contradiction.

Now suppose that J is a nonzero ideal of R. Then
R/T — Vo(ur = 0)

where r € J is nonzero. Since the above sentence is false in R, we have J = R,
hence R is a simple ring. Since the theory of R-modules is model complete, every
embedding is elementary and thus a pure embedding, so R must be von Neumann

regular.

Conversely, suppose R is infinite, simple and von Neumann regular. We claim
that M is a model of T*. If M is not a model of T*, then Inv(M, ¢, w) is finite for
every positive primitive formulas ¢ and w. Consider ¢ and w in one free variable.
Since R is von Neumann regular, Theorem 3.11 implies that there is a nonzero

idempotent e of R such that
Inv(M, ¢,) = Inv(M,v = ve, v = 0) = |Me/{0}| = | Me].

So there is a nonzero idempotent e of R such that Me is finite. Since M is nonzero,
ann(M) = {0} ie. M is faithful. That M is faithful is equivalent to the condition:
Va,b € R such that a # b, there is an m € M such that ma 4 mb. Now suppose
that Re is infinite. Since M is faithful, ifre 4 r’e for re, r’e € R, then mre # mr'e.
Hence, it follows that the set

{mre :re € Re} C Me

is infinite. This contradicts that A/e is finite. So Re must be finite. The submod-
ules of Rp are precisely the ideals of R. In particular, Re is a nonzero ideal of R
since e is a nonzero idempotent of R (we have considered rings to be unital). But
R is simple so Re = R. It follows that R is finite, contradicting that RF is infinite.
We conclude that M is a model of T*. Hence, if Mf and M’' are modules over an
infinite, simple, and von Neumann regular ring R, every embedding of M to M’

is elementary, that is, T is model complete.

Chapter 4

Main results

In this chapter, we present the main results of the thesis. Let us define the category
of models of a theory T. By a category we adopt Mac Lane’s definition that
a metacategory is any model of the category-theoretic axioms while a category
is valued in sets [CWM, p.7-9]. Now the class of models of a theory T forms
a category denoted M(T) whose objects are the models of the theory (in our
case, these are modules over a fixed ring R) and whose morphisms are elementary
embeddings. There category M(T) where T is the theory of R-modules is different
from the category of R-modules because elementary embeddings must preserve any
first-order statement (with parameters) but a usual module homomorphism need
not have this property [5, Lecture 2]. So an arrow may not exist in M(T) yet exists
in the category of R-modules. This is where the notion of model completeness

becomes crucial.

4.1 On syntactic completeness

We will show that any module over an infinite, simple, von Neumann regular ring
is first-order logic invariant.
Theorem 4.1. A module over a simple, von Neumann regular and infinite ring

is unique up to elementary equivalence.

Proof. Let T be the theory of modules over a simple, infinite and von Neumann
regular ring R and let M(T) be the category of models of T. If M, and M2
are modules over R, then their direct sum M, M2. = M, x Mb is another
module over R. Furthermore, there are canonical embeddings i, : MJ) > MM, @ Me
and ig : Mz + M, ® Mp by the universal property of products/coproducts. By
model completeness of T, these embeddings are elementary and thus 7; and 72 are

morphisms in M(T). But if this is so, then for any first-order ¢
MF (1, -.en) <=> M @ ™, EF $(41(c1), .-,41(Cn))

and

Mz F (di, .-.dn) <=> Mi BD M2 F (i2(di), --, t2(dn))


for all n, and all cy, ...,¢n € Mi, dy,...,dn € Aly. By setting n = 0 we see that M,,
Mz and M, @ M; all satisfy the same first-order sentences (without parameters)

i.e. for any sentence ¢

MES = MES MOYMES

But these models M, and M» are chosen arbitrarily and we have shown M, = AJ,
thus the theory T has one model up to elementary equivalence. And so T is

syntactically-complete. O

The above theorem thus shows that the theory of modules over a simple, infi-

nite and von Neumann regular ring is syntactically complete.

In the case where F is also an Artin algebra (e.g. if it is an Artin ring), then
we are able to determine R-modules up to a weaker form of equivalence. For what
has been shown is that a choice of von Neumann regular, simple and infinite ring

R completely determines a uniserial module over R up to elementary equivalence.

This theorem generalizes the well-known result that infinite vector spaces over
infinite fields are unique up to elementary equivalence, since any field is simple
and von Neumann regular. Also, as a consequence of syntactic completeness, the
theory of modules over an infinite, simple, von Neumann regular ring is decidable.
By decidable we mean that there is an effective method to determine (in a finite

amount of time) if a sentence is a theorem or not.

A natural question arises: if a module over a ring R is unique up to elementary
equivalence, what can be said of R? Is R necessarily von Neumann regular? In-
deed in [1, p.325], it was stated that it is not known whether the theory of nonzero
R-modules being syntactically complete is sufficient to imply that R is infinite,
simple and von Neumann regular. We claim that if, in addition, every right ideal
of R is an elementary substructure of R as a module over itself, then R must be

infinite, simple and von Neumann regular.

Theorem 4.2. /f the theory of right R-modules is syntactically-complete and every
right ideal of R is an elementary substructure of R as a module over R then R is

an infinite, simple and von Neumann regular.
Proof. Suppose otherwise that R is finite. That is, |R| is finite and R is a finite


module over itself. By syntactic completeness, any two modules over R are ele-
mentary equivalent. Consider the module R” over R where n > 1. Since |R| is
finite, |R”| is finite for any n > 1. Since elementary equivalence and isomorphism
coincides for finite structures, |R| = |R”| for some n > 1. This is a contradiction

because R is nonzero. Hence R must be an infinite ring.

Let / be an ideal of R, such that J # R and consider the factor module R/I.
Then
R/I — Vx(ar = 0)

for any r € J. Note that this is a closed formula in the ianguage of right R-modules
since r € R. By syntactic completeness, R/J and R are elementary equivalent as
modules over R and so

RE V2(zr = 0)

Thus J must be the trivial ideal of R. So R has no proper nonzero ideal i.e. R is

a simple ring.
We note that right ideais of R are right R-modules. Now consider the class sign
(formula with 1-free variable)

B(x) = Jy(yr = «)

where r € R. We know that. R as an R-module models f(r) since lr = r follows
from an axiom of the theory of R-modules. By the assumption that every right
ideal of R is an elementary substructure of R as a module over itself, the (principal)

right ideal rt as module over R models f(r). That is
rR E dy(yr =r).
But if this is so, there must be a u € rR such that
rREur=r
and so for any r € R there is a v € R such that
RE ror =r.
Since r is arbitrary, R is a von Neumann regular ring. oO


We note that the conditions on ring R in Theorem 4.1 are sufficient for ele-
mentary equivalence but not for isomorphism. To show insufficiency, we make use

of the Lowenheim-Skolem Theorem, which is a well-known result in model theory.

Theorem 4.3. Léwenheim-Skolem. If T is a theory with infinite model M,

then T has a model of every infinite cardinality.

Theorem 4.4. Let T be the syntactically-complete theory of modules over an

infinite, simple, von Neumann regular ring R. Then, there are nonisomorphic
models of T.

Proof. Let T be the theory of R-modules above. If R is infinite, then the module
R over R is also infinite. By Lowenheim-Skolem Theorem and Theorem 4.1, there
are nonisomorphic yet elementary equivalent models of T.



4.2 An application

We give an application of Theorem 4.1. and Theorem 3.12.

Theorem 4.5. Let D be an infinite division ring. If M and N are modules over
the matriz ring M,(D), then M = N. Furthermore, if M embeds into N, then
an arbitrary finite system of equations has a solution in M if and only if it has a

solution in N.

Proof. Suppose DP is an infinite division ring and M, N are M,(D)-modules. By
the Artin Wedderburn theorem (8, p.50], the matrix ring M,() is simple, von:
Neumann regular and Artinian. Hence, by Theorem 4.1, every two modules over
M,(D) are elementary equivalent. So M is elementary equivalent to N as M,,(D)-
modules.

Now suppose that a},...,a, € M and suppose there is an embedding from M
to N. By Theorem 3.12, every embedding of two M,,(D)-modules are elementary.
So if kon

NE 32, str /\O> Lily = a;)
j=l i=l
where rj; € A7,(D), then

k n
M §- 3a, stn f\O> “iN iz = az).

j=l i=l
That is, if the system of equations

LM +... LrTn = A

Zyrjo +... + UnTn2 = AQ

TT 1b +--+ InTak =

has a solution in N, then it must have a solution in M!.
O

Indeed, if we further suppose that M and N are nonzero and have no nonzero
proper submodules (i.e. that M and N are simple modules), then they are clearly
uniserial and we have not only elementary equivalence but also M = N = D”. To
see this, we note that D and M,(D) are Morita equivalent rings (Two rings are
Morita equivalent if their category of right modules are equivalent as categories).

Since D is the only simple right D-module, the only simple M,(D)-module is D”.


4.3. Possible research directions

We note possible research directions:

1. Prove or disprove the converse of Theorem 4.1. That is, given that the theory
of modules over a ring R is syntactically complete, does it imply that R is

von Neumann regular?

2. A class C' of modules is axiomatizable if C’ is the class of models of a set of
first-order sentences in the language of modules. It is known that a syntacti-
cally complete theory of modules is axiomatizable by sentences with no more
than one change of quantifiers. By Theorem 4.1, the theory of modules T
over an infinite, von Neumann regular and simple ring is syntactically com-
plete so it can be axiomatized by sentences of form Inu(—,¢,w) < k where
¢ and ~ are positive primitive in one free variable. We posit a problem: pro-
vide an explicit set S of boolean combination of conditions Inu(—,¢,~) < k

axiomatizing T.
