ABSTRACT

The behavior of resource users within common pool resources (CPRs), such as
coastal fisheries, is directly influenced by the characteristics of the resource, the resource
users themselves, and the rules that gover the use of the resource. The primary aim of
this study is to identify the determinant factors influencing the cooperative behavior of
Barangay Bucal artisanal fishers, measured as consistent compliance to the formal choice
rules, within the coastal fishery of Calamba City. In this study, formal choice rules refer
to the enacted prescriptions of actions the fishers must, must not, or may take in the city’s coastal fishery. A questionaire survey was conducted last August 2015 using items previously
proposed by Agrawal as recurrent factors associated with cooperative behavior in CPRs.
The mode of the fishers’ compliance to the formal choice rules was also evaluated in the survey. Based on the skewness of their Compliance Index (CD), it was discovered that the
consistent compliance to the formal choice rules among the artisanal fishers is moderate
despite the existence of an alternative set of informal choice rules. Using phi, the fishers' level of wealth, age, educational attainment, mode of utilizing Laguna de Bay catfish, and membership status in the local fishermen’s association were found to be strongly
associated with the consistency of their compliance to the formal choice rules.
Specifically, through simple logistic regression it was revealed that the odds for
consistent compliance is higher if a fisher a) has medium to high number of household
fixtures, b) is more than 50 years old in age, c) has finished highschool, d) markets his
Laguna de Bay catfish catch, and e) is a member of the organisation Barangay Bucal
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management Council/Sagisag ng Mangingisda ng Barangay Bucal (BFARMC/SAMBBU). As such, these results show that increasing cooperation among the artisanal
fishers in using the formal choice rules, which can potentially improve the conservation
of the Calamba City-coastal fishery, is possible. Specifically, this can happen a) if the
fishers are not experiencing survival constraints; b) if they have the necessary set of
cognitive skills, interest, and knowledge of the political and ecological issues surrounding
the management of the coastal fishery; and, c) if they have developed strong moral norms in favour of following the formal choice rules.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

The concept of institutions suggests rules in the form of “in case of X do Y” that
are customary or shared, normative and have the eventual effect of influencing human
interactions (Hodgson, 2006; Ostrom, 2005; Basurto ef al., 2010). As it is, institutions
include norms, conventions, and legal rules (Vatn, 2006). Institutional arrangements,
which are set of related institutions or rules that establishes “the relationships between
individuals in relation to things” (Schlagger, 1990; Polski & Ostrom, 1999), act as
mechanisms for adjusting and ordering behavior, and eventually individual interactions.
As such, institutional arrangements are necessary in situations that require coordination
of two or more individuals, or groups of individuals (Polski & Ostrom, 1999). Such
situation is prevalent when it comes to the management of natural resources primarily in
the management of common pool resources (CPR) where the constant threat of “free
rider problem” can act as a major disincentive for their users to invest in their

management (Thomson & Freudenberger, 1997; Thomson, 1992; McGinnis, 2010).

Management of CPRs is important since their exploitation is always a “commons
situation” (Gardner, Ostrom & Walker, 1994 as cited in ICLARM and NSC, 1996;
Schlager, 1990; Wade, 1994) that can become a “commons dilemma” when their non-
excludability and subtractable benefit-characteristics are joined with scarcity. This results

in joint users interfering with each other’s use producing rent dissipation (Baland &

Platteau, 1996) that if left unchecked could realize what Hardin called “Tragedy of the
Commons” (Ostrom, 1990). In coastal fisheries, commons dilemma takes the form of
provision problems and allocation problems, such as stock externality, technological

externality and assignment problems (Schlager, Blomquist, & Tang, 1994).

Indeed, institutional arrangements are vital in the management of CPRs including

coastal fisheries. It must be emphasized that compliance to in:

tional arrangements by
the resource users or technically their cooperation in terms of allowing the said set of
rules to coordinate their actions is structured by the attributes of the resource being
exploited, the resource users themselves, and the local resource management institutional
arrangements which are collectively called the contextual variables or exogenous factors
(ICLARM & NSC, 1996). It must also be emphasized based on the comparative work of
Agrawal (2002) on the book-length studies of Wade (1988), Ostrom (1990), and Baland
and Plateu (1996), that there is no single widely accepted list of conditions of the above-
mentioned attributes that automatically makes institutional arrangements designed for
CPR management sustainable. Rather, it was shown that under some frequently occurring
combinations of conditions, members of small groups can design and comply with
institutional arrangements that help in the sustainable management of their CPRs. These
recurrent conditions are later summarized by Agrawal into a list of 32 critical enabling

conditions (Appendix B).

Agrawal (2002), despite conceding to the impossibility of creating a universal list
of critical enabling conditions, nevertheless subscribed to the notion that a list of them,

such as the one in his study, can rather serve as starting point in the search for a

compelling explanation for the sustainability of a given CPR. Overall, Agrawal
concluded that instead of focusing on lists of factors or conditions that can be applied to
all sustainably-managed commons, it is more productive to focus instead on

configurations of local conditions that are responsible for such sustainability.

Statement of the Problem

Resource management is occurring in the municipal waters of Calamba City. This
is evident in the involvement of its fisherfolks, the City Government of Calamba, and
other government and non-government agencies in the integrated process of information

gathering, analysis, planning, consultation, decision-making, allocation of resources, and

formulation and implementation with enforcement mechanism built-in) of rules

which coordinate fishing acti s inside the coastal fishery (FAO, 1997). As such, it
must then be emphasized that the said management is in effect a case of CPR

management since all coastal fisheries are essentially CPRs (Gardner et al., 1990).

This classification of Calamba City’s coastal fishery as CPR is also evident on the
nature of the physical characteristics - excludability and subtractability - of the
appropriated fishes and other lake species which are the primary interest of the artisanal
fishers in their ulitzation of the fishery and whose increased productivity and sustainable
exploitation are the objectives of the fishery management taking place (McGinnis, 2010;
Ostrom, E & Ostrom, V, 1977 as cited in Thomson & Freudenberger, 1997; Appendix

B). In relation to this, it is pointed out that the said resource units are non-excludable, as

any open-lake fishers in Laguna de Bay can potentially harvest the fishes, and that they
are subtractable, for once the fishes are appropriated they will no longer be available to

other fishers.

In light of the classification of the management of Calamba City’s coastal fishery
as a case of CPR management, its common users must therefore coordinate their
behavior, or cooperate with each other within the existing management regime.
Otherwise, freerider problems will set in or be aggravated to the point of fostering the
adoption of shutdown practices among themselves. This can lead to the collapse of the
management regime and the persistence of the commons dilemma as they likely exist in

the fishery already.

Thus, with respect to the need of fostering cooperation among the artisanal fishers
in the form of their consistent compliance to the formal choice mules, it becomes
imperative that the factors or “configuration of local conditions” positively influencing
such compliance be elucidated. Emphasis is given to formal choice rules since 83.33% of
the rules formally instituted in the said fishery are choice rules in type. Aside from this,
formal choice rules can also have the most direct effect on the fishery’s sustainability as
they are the written prescriptions of actions the artisanal fishers must, must not, or may

take in various circumstances of their open-lake fishing activities (Cole, n.d.).

Since the consistent compliance to the formal choice rules does not have a
universal blueprint (Agrawal, 2002), Agrawal’s list of critical enabling conditions
provided the scope of the socioeconomic and exogenous factors used in the study.

Furthermore, as the study requires at least a population of artisanal fishers of moderate

size from the coastal area of Calamba City, the population of artisanal fishers in

Barangay Bucal is selected.

Significance of the Study

The conduct of institutional analysis on the cooperative behavior of Brgy Bucal’s
artisanal fishers has reaffirmed that as an approach, institutitonal analysis can be a useful
critical first step in evaluating community-level fishery management systems for the

purpose of providing information on their essential features, operations and impacts.

‘As this study used the institutional analysis approach, the set of socio-economic
and exogenous factors and cooperation indicators that were used can be transferred and
employed in the analysis of the cooperative behaviors of other fishery groups, such as the
artisanal fishers in the other nine coastal barangays of Calamba City. The data collected
for Barangay Bucal can therefore serve as a first entry in the systematic and comparative
analysis of the cooperative behavior of the different fisher groups within the context of

the existing fishery management in Calamba City.

More importantly, the study can provide directions for the formulation of actions
to further improve the conservation of the fishery, specifically the part appropriated by
the artisanal fishers of Barangay Bucal. Particularly, the results of this study can indicate
what conditions can bring about successful, long-enduring, and locally sustainable
implementation of the formal choice rules which can be used by the barangay’s fishery

users and stakeholders through the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management

Council (FARMC) as well as the City Government of Calamba as basis in their

policymaking and planning.

Objectives of the Study

Generally, this research aims to asses the determinants influencing the compliance

to the formal choice rules within the fishery management of Calamba City.

Specifically, this study intends to:

a. assess the socioeconomic characteristics of the artisanal fishers affected by the
management of the open-lake fishery in Calamba City, Laguna;

b. assess the charateristics of the exogenous factors in the management of the open-
lake fishery in Calamba City, Laguna;

c. evaluate the compliance to the formal choice rules among the artisanal fishers of
Calamba City, Laguna; and,

d. examine the relationship of the artisanal fishers’ socio-economic characteristics
and their perceptions of the exogenous factors with their compliance to the formal

choice rules.

Research Hypothesis

Based on the conceptual framework and related studies reviewed, the following

hypotheses are formulated in this study:

1. The configuration of socio-economic characteristics determining the compliance
to the formal choice fules among the open-lake fishers is not consistent to the
configuration formulated by Agrawal.

2. The configuration of the exogenous factors determining the compliance to the
formal choice rules among the open-lake fishers is not comparable to the
configuration formulated by Agrawal.

3. Majority of the open-lake fishers are in complete compliance to the formal choice
tules.

4. The compliance to the formal choice rules among the open-lake fishers is
determined by the following socio-economic characteristics and exogenous
factors: size of fish catch, fishing gears used, age, educational attainment, family
size, level of relative wealth, level of dependence on the resource, moral norms,
characteristics of leaders, price level of the harvested species, involvement of the
state in the management, monitoring, adjudication, and sanctioning mechanisms,

and simplicity of the rules.

Conceptual Framework

As emphasized above, institutional arrangements influence individual interactions
in CPR managements. However, its presence does not immediately lead to coordination
and collective action of CPR users. Alternatively, in order to achieve desired outcomes in

CPR managements, other factors, specifically the resource and resource users, should be

considered.

As it is, these factors do not act independently of each other. Instead, causal
relationships exist among them aside from the one that exists between them and the
resulting cooperation situations within CPR management systems. In this scheme, local
institutional arrangements, structured by the characteristics of the other factors including
those from its own, affect the actions of resource users by shaping the incentives and
disincentives they face in the different cooperation situations. In other words, individual
user’s choice of behavior in cooperation situations will depend on how he or she weighs
the benefits and costs of cooperation and non-cooperation. This is in turn based on how

he or she percieves the characteristics of the different exogenous factors.

Figure 1 below summarizes the exogenous factors and their hypothesized
relationships under the study. In the said figure, modes of fishing refer to the decisions
made by the artisanal fishers of Barangay Bucal on whether or not to consistently observe
the formal choice rules when they harvest from the fishery once granted access. As such,

these situations include whether they should:

For the resource-related factors, physical factors refer to the size and general
condition of the fishery as well as the observability of its boundaries. Biological factors,
on the other hand, pertain to the size and composition of the fishers’ catch as well as the
visibility and predictability of conditions of the fish stocks in the fishery. Meanwhile
technological factors cover the composition of fishing vessels and gears used in the
fishery, number of vessels and gears owned by the fishers, and monitorability of banned

gears in the fishery.

For the resource user-related factors, demographic attributes pertain to the
population size of fishers inside the fishery as well as their age, gender, educational
attainment, family size, ethnicity, religion, length of residence in the barangay, length of
fishing experience and past-experience in non-fishing occupation. Social attributes on
the other hand pertain to the presence of communication avenues among fishers, the
frequency of such communication, boundaries and interdependencies between fishers,
characteristics of their leaders, any successful past experience in cooperation, and
membership in fishermen’s associations. Meanwhile, economic attributes encompass the
relative wealth of fishers, their level of dependence on the fishery, orientation of their
fishing activities, and fairness in the allocation of benefits from the fishery. Lastly,
cultural attributes refer to the fishers’ moral norms, while market attributes pertain to the

stability of market as well as the value of resource units.

For the institutional arrangement-related factors, complexity attribute pertains to
the knowledge of fishers about fishing rules. On the other hand, compatibility attributes
pertain to the kind of decision-making process available as well as the general
compatibility of rules to local conditions. Meanwhile, enforcement attributes pertain to
the level of rule violation, the sanctioning and adjudication mechanisms available, and
accountability of monitors and other officials. Lastly, the external assistance attributes
pertain to the level of involvement of the government in the fishery management as well

as the amount of external aid given to support it.

CHAPTER I

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

Contextual Variables and Collective
Action of Users

Although the experience of commons dilemma or rent dissipation is necessary for
institutional arrangements to be subscribed, it is nevertheless insufficient. In theory, the
action arena for the collective actions of the resource users is structured by exogenous
factors or contextual variables that characterize key attributes of the resource, the
resource users and the local resource management institutional arrangements.
Specifically, these contextual variables are a) the community institutional and
organizational arrangements variable, b) the biological, physical and technological
variable, c) the market variable, d) the resource user, stakeholder and community
variable, e) the external institutional and organizational arrangements variable, and f) the

exogenous variable (ICLARM & NSC, 1996).

In this case, the institutional arrangements, structured by the contextual variables,
affect the actions of the resource users by shaping the incentives and disincentives they
face to coordinate and cooperate in resource governance, management and use. The

incentives in turn, shape the patterns of interaction that result when resource users select

13

and implement resource use strategies. These interactions result in outcomes which may,

in tum, affect other outcomes (ICLARM & NSC, 1996).

Effects of Exogenous Attributes
‘on Collective Action

Resource Scarcity and Survival Constraints

The success of institutional arrangements governing CPRs such as fisheries are
more likely if there is great demand (i.e. up to a limit) for it and the more vital its role in
the survival of the users (Wade, 1994). If appropriators do not obtain a major part of their
income from the resource or value it highly for some other purposes (i.e. source of
insurance or credit) (Baland & Platteau, 1996), the high costs of organizing and
maintaining a self-governing system may not be worth their effort (Lawry, 1990; Gibson,

2001).

In societies where resources are abundant, people who are dependent on the latter
typically do not see their finite nature. In such resource systems, the presence of flexible
rules and the absence of conservation rules are usually observed. However, as
productivity lowers due to enhanced competition between the users or from enhanced
competition and the erosion of the environmental capital stock, strict access rules come
about, and if conditions warrant, strict conservation rules too (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

Ostrom (2005), in relation to this kind of observation, posits that appropriators find little

reason to invest costly time and effort in organizing if the resources are abundant; instead
self-organization is likely to occur only after they observe substantial scarcity. Wade
(1994) in addressing the possibility if whether the Kottapalle type of irrigation
organization can be adopted elsewhere in India concluded the same that it is not likely
since such organization is only found where the net collective benefit is relatively high as

exhibited in villages with increased water stress.

However, too much resource scarcity is also detrimental for collective action.

During times when individual incomes extracted from the resource fall below the
subsistence level without compensation from alternative sources of income, the
temptation to violate conservation rules becomes irresistible. This is since, owing to the
survival constraint, the discount rate of future incomes becomes infinite and free riding

behavior appears as a natural weapon in the struggle for sheer subsistence (Baland &

Platteau, 1996).

In general, subsistence-constrained users have much greater incentives than more
well-off users to seek to conserve their resource base, since they have limited alternative
income resources. Nevertheless, if the resource base is initially degraded, they may be
unable, owing to the low level of their wealth and to severe credit imperfections, to build
it up to the level where it can be optimally maintained (Baland & Platteau, 1996). Thus,
just like during periods of severe scarcity, segments of the population cannot be forced to
contribute to the conservation of a resource if they are desperately poor since their
concern for sheer survival in the short run may lead them to heavily discount the future

benefits of conservation strategy and to overweigh the present costs. Such is not the case,

15

however, with the richer resource-dependent users who can safely adopt a more
conservative use of the resource as they believe that with their level of wealth, the total
gain from following conservationist strategies would outweigh its total cost (Baland &

Platteau, 1996).

Group Size, Group Communication,
Moral Norms, and Leadership

According to Schlagger (1990) aside from the expected collective benefit
suggested by Wade (1994) as the main factor explaining the presence or absence of
collective organization in the villages he studied, other factors - noticeability and
measurability of the problem; number of involved users; and the possibility to devise
enforceable rules - are also critical. Incidentally, Baland and Plateau (1996), in their
review of important literatures on cooperation in CPRs, came up with a similar list of

factors.

The size of the user group is preferable to be small (Wade, 1994; Baland &
Plateau, 1996; Schlager, 1990). If individuals know one another, can observe one
another’s behaviors, and are in continuous interaction with one another such as in small-
group settings, any pattem of collective behavior, including cooperation, can be
sustained, which will make each individual better off than under universal defection. The
ability to observe directly or indirectly the actions of others is advantageous for

cooperative actions since it increases assurance from being cheated as the users can base

16

their actions on the past actions of others; which means they can immediately defect
during repeated interactions if the possibility of being suckered arises. This assurance is
furthered if the appropriators” interrelationships is continuous or intertwined in which
their interaction with respect to resource management could not be isolated from other
interests thus giving them incentive, just like with easy observability, to consider the
more indirect and long-term consequences of their choices instead of paying exclusive
attention to immediate costs and benefits (Baland & Platteau, 1996). Furthermore, with
respect to the profusion of equilibria that may exist in repeated collective interactions,
small groups may be at an advantage since they allow the possibility for pre-play
communication wherein individuals, the users, can reveal and signal their intended plans

of actions thus enabling them to choose good equilibria (Baland & Plateau, 1996).

Small group size is important in sustaining the trust or assurance needed in the
cooperation between individuals, it is also critical in the development of moral norms.
Moral norms are internalized behavior patterns that are maintained even in the absence of
external monitoring and sanctioning since the conformity of the act becomes a motive of
its own as it is intrinsically rewarding or because deviation is intrinsically costly (Weber,
1971; Opp, 1979; Jones, 1984; Taylor, 1987 as cited in Baland & Plateau, 1996). As

such the main function of moral norms vis-a-

is availability of resource units, which are
borne during times of scarcity or low productivity as brought by critical pressure (i.e.
depletion, degradation) on natural resources, is to ensure that the latter remains viable for
the group. As it is, well established moral norms sustained by primary and secondary
socialization can make collective actions successful since users tend a) to adopt others’

viewpoint when making decisions that may harm others’ interests and to feel internally

7

rewarded when behaving in other-regarding, ways; b) to be confident that others will
abide by the same code of good behaviors as themselves; c) to cling to this code even
when they had unpleasant experiences in which they were stickers; d) to feel guilty after
they have (perhaps mistakenly) deviated from the moral rule; and e) to feel vengeful and
willing to punish detectable free-riders including those who refuse to do so and continue

to entertain good relations with free-riders (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

According to Goette, Huffman, and Meier (2006), another way in which moral
norms for cooperation are also developed is through membership in an organization. An
important feature of organizations is that they constitute a social boundary, or group
determining with which people an individual interacts on a daily basis. For Goette, et. al.
(2006) this social aspect of organizations has an important benefit of transforming
individuals, leading to internalized roles, norms and values that affect behavior. In their
study involving Swiss Army trainee-officers assigned to different platoons, Goette, ef. al.
(2006) found that group membership has a strong impact on underlying preferences for
cooperation, so that subjects prefer to cooperate with their own group as opposed to the
out-group. This, according to them, is due to the direct impact of group membership on
the beliefs of individuals that members of their own group are more likely to be
cooperative. This is vital since cooperation, as pointed above, is conditional and increases
with the belief that others will also cooperate. Furthermore, Goette, ef. al. (2006) also
found that group membership increases willingness to enforce a norm of cooperative
behavior towards fellow group members as they observed that punishment by a selected
subject was much stronger when defection affects an in-group member as opposed to an

‘out-group member.

18

‘As mentioned above, communication between users is important in establishing
assurance, and as such its frequency should be increased since its impact is rather short-
lived. Moral norms also improve through communication especially when promise-
making is involved. According to Ostrom (2005) the advantage of communication is that
not only does it transform players from mere strangers into real people, thus shifting the
bases for decision making for cooperation from reason to emotion (Frank, 1988 as cited
in Baland & Plateau, 1996), it also provides an opportunity for individuals to offer and
extract promises of cooperation for non-enforceable contracts. This is salient since, aside
from clearly signaling one’s intention which raises assurance, “promise-keeping” is a
moral norm in itself that is more fundamental than “cooperation per se” and which would
lead to people, when violations are observable, to make violent reproaches when
someone is breaking a promise, is being uncooperative or is taking advantage of others
who are keeping a promise (Ostrom, ef. al., 1994 as cited by Baland & Plateau, 1996).
These possible outcomes would provide additional disincentive to cheating when the

group size is small and therefore more reason to trust the other users.

But even if communication as well as promise-making is not explicit, provided
relevant moral norms are established and strong, group members can make their
decisions to cooperate straightaway since their mutual expectations are sufficiently
structured. This is why in large groups where relationships are largely anonymous and
where private sanctioning activities are certain to bring no future reward to the punishing
agent, the self-policing mechanisms provided by moral norms becomes relevant as a

practical way of solving collective action problems, even besting options of using a

19

central agency to act as an external norm enforcer and the users themselves inflicting

sanctions upon one another in a decentralized manner (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

The same commitment to cooperation, when normative considerations (moral
norms) such as fairness are present, is also obtained even if individuals who are
anonymous to each other play an equivalent of a one-shot game. Although cooperation is
more likely to happen when interactions will be repeated infinitely or indefinitely,
interactions occurring in finite number of periods including those that are rather short can
still produce cooperation since a) people probably do not use such a sophisticated device
as the backwards-induction argument when they reason about their strategic choice, and
b) people may well cooperate until near the end of finitely repeated games or in short
they follow a tit-for-tat strategy if they entertain some slight doubts about the type of

strategy followed by their opponents (Baland & Plateau, 1996).

Another advantage of small group size when it comes to producing cooperation
among its members is its lesser vulnerability to the problems of incentive dilution (Olson,
1982 as cited by Baland & Platteau, 1996) and diffusion-of-responsibility (Frank, 1988 as
cited by Baland & Platteau, 1996). In incentive dilution, cooperation is discouraged since
as more idividuals make up the group the incentive that an individual gets from
cooperating is reduced while its cost remains constant. On the other hand, when there is
diffusion-of-responsibility, the problem of fostering cooperation comes from lessened
pressure to cooperate since it is not focused on anyone and the responsibility is shared
among all of the users. Hence, the incentive to free-ride decreases as the group size

becomes smaller since the collective income is less and less shared and the responsi


20

to cooperate becomes more and more focused. But aside from these, and as implied also
by the relative ease in which small groups can conduct pre-play communication, the
smallness of the group size also allows for agreements among the members to be reached
at low negotiation costs. This would include the costs of communication and bargaining,
as well as, possibly, those of creating and maintaining a formal organization (Olson, 1982

as cited in Baland & Platteau, 1996).

Role models also have important function in peoples’ decision to exhibit other-
regarding behavior which is necessary to foster cooperation. In this, role models are
viewed as privileged agents who reactivate emotional capacities associated with primary
socialization processes. That means that political leaders as well as other forms of role
models reactivate cooperation-fostering moral norms when they publicly behave in

cooperative ways (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

Aside from this, leaders are important in fostering cooperation since they can
lower the cost of sustaining the institutional arrangement by creating the necessary
consensus or, at least, to drive enough resource users to adopt cooperative behavior. For
effective leadership, traditional ones seems to be particularly welcome in so far as it

entails no set-up costs since it is already in existence (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

User Heterogeneity

Users exhibiting heterogeneity in ability and yield may have difficulty in
willingly organizing themselves for specific regulations. That is, regulations that pose
disproportionate constraints on some users will be opposed by those that will be
adversely affected. Indeed, if users have equal abilities and yields, the net gains from
effort controls would be evenly spread, and given large estimates of rent dissipation, rules
governing effort would be quickly adopted (Johnson & Libecap, 1982 as cited in Baland
& Platteau, 1996). For example, total effort in a coastal fishery could be restricted
through uniform quotas for eligible fishermen. But if the fishermen are heterogeneous,
uniform quota will be costly to assign and enforce because of opposition from more
productive fishermen. Thus, without side payments to those who will be
disproportionately constrained, uniform quotas could leave more productive fishermen
worse off, hence the opposition (Johnson & Libecap, 1982 as cited in Baland & Platteau,
1996). Thus, the main implication one can draw from the analysis, is that where agents
are heterogencous, regulating the commons efficiently may cause conflicts of interests to

erupt (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

In many instances, regulation through the individual reduction of each agent’s
level of effort alone is not possible. In those cases, regulation must take place through the
exclusion of some users, the remaining ones being then in a position to reap and share
amongst themselves the benefits of such a measure through the increased productivity of
their resource appropriations; in fact, exclusion may well be a necessary step before any

other efficiency-improving measure is contemplated. However, on this it must be

2

emphasized that if the uscrs are risk-averse, such method of regulation will not be
acceptable. That is, if the selection of the members to be excluded will be uniformly
random, meaning all of them are candidates for exclusion, and that no side payments or
alternative source of the benefit in question is offered, exclusion will not be opted by the
group. Therefore, one may expect that, when regulation through exclusion must take
place, exclusion will not be random but will be invariably directed towards a definite
subgroup of members of the community. One may also expect that, when the group is
homogeneous, exclusion will not always be resorted to and, as a result, overpopulation of

productive units is likely (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

Regulation in the CPR can also be done via designing a tax schedule. However,
such an instrument can be difficult to obtain if everything relevant to the problem is not
known to everybody. For starters, in order for a taxation scheme to work the proceeds of
the taxes should not be siphoned off by the central state, since every productive member
of the community will be worse off then; instead, the proceeds should be redistributed to
the members of the taxed community. Second, the members should receive a share of the
tax proceed proportional to the amount of variable factor they were applying in the initial
situation, which is one characterized by overexploitation (Baland & Platteau, 1996).
However, in many instances, the community or the traditional authority is not in a
position to have all the information relevant to the problem. Here, the phenomena of
“private information” may be encountered. Typically, preferences and private
endowments are likely to be private information; that is, only the agent concerned knows
exactly his preferences, skills and endowment. It is important that these information are

known by a central authority, which must be neutral and credible, so that they can be

23

processed and an allocation for the proceeds be proposed. The critical question in this
case however, is if whether or not there exists some way of passing from the announced
preference and endowments to an allocation that provides the proper incentives for agents
to tell the truth. Hence, in the presence of private information, if an efficient allocation
has to be achieved, then some agents will be hurt, and were they allowed to do so, they
would veto the regulation scheme. However in the case that the users are identical in their
endowments, skills and preferences, the private information problem disappears (Baland

& Plateau, 1996).

Educational Attainment

High educational attainment has been widely argued to positively affect civic
engagement. In here civic engagement takes various forms including but not limited to
voting, interest group membership and activity, volunteering, and being involved in local
groups, such as committees and commissions, churches or citizen’s coalition and
movements (Young, 2011). As such, it can also be argued that resource-user cooperation
in the management or conservation of a resource (i.e. specifically public and CPR) is also
Positively affected by higher educational attainment as it is another form of civic
engagement in the form of volunteering in the activites of an interest group or local
groups. According Young (2011), cooperation among resource users with higher
educational attainment is increased as they have greater understanding of not only

political but also ecological happenings, history and how these events could impact them

24

Specifically, Milligan, Moretti and Oreopoulos (2003), pointed out that such
enhancement and broadening of civic participation could be due to education equipping
the resource users with cognitive skills that enable them to select able leaders, understand
the issues upon which they will vote, act as a check on the potential excesses of the
government, and recognize corruption in leaders. At the same time, education can also
improve citizen’s interest and knowledge of political and ecological issues, their

involvement in the political process, and ultimately, the effectiveness of their political

participation.

Age, Values and Cooperative Behavior

Values are defined as desirable, trans-situational goals, varying in importance,
that serve as guiding principles in people’s lives (Schwartz, n.d.). They differ from moral
norms as they can be ordered by importance relative to one another. Values affect
behavior only if they are activated (Verplanken & Holland, 2002 as cited in Schwartz,
n.d.). As such, the more important values are, the more they become accessible or easily
come to mind, and the more they relate to behavior (Shwartz, n.d). Based on the
motivational goal they express, ten basic values are derived: self-direction, stimulation,
hedonism, achievement, power, security, conformity, tradition, benevolence, and

universalism.

Life circumstances make the pursuit or expression of different values more or less

rewarding or costly. Typically, people adapt their values to their life circumstances. They

25

upgrade the importance they attribute to values they can readily attain and downgrade the
importance of values whose pursuit is blocked (Schawrtz, & Bardi, 1997 as cited in
‘Schawrtz, n.d.). Upgrading attainable values and downgrading thwarted values applies to
most, but not to all values. The reverse occurs with values that concern material well-
being (power) and security. When such values are blocked, their importance increases;
when they are easily attained their importance drops. People’s age is one of the
characteristics that largely determine the life circumstances to which they are exposed

(Schawrtz, n.d.).

With age, strength, energy, cognitive speed, memory, and sharpness of the senses
decline. As such, security values maybe more important because a safe and predictable
environment is more critical as capacities to cope with change wane. Conformity and
tradition values may also be more important with age because accepted ways of doing

thing are less demanding and threatening (Shwartz, n.d.).

Rule Legitimacy, Monitoring and
Sanctioning, and Rule Clarity

In deciding how to behave in the CPR, users do not only take cues coming from
the size of the group or the existing relevant moral norms, the importance of which are
pegged in their capacity to provide the user-players assurance from becoming suckers, or
from role models and leaders, to influence them into cooperating, they also assess the

degree of legitimacy of rules and institutions. It must be emphasized that the users”

26

compliance with a rule is indeed strongly influenced by the extent to which they think
that the rule and the enforcing agency are legitimate. By legitimate, the rule and the
enforcing authority must be appropriate and consistent with the users’ internalized norms
of faimess. But more than this, the rule and enforcing authority must be able to provide
favorable or positive outcomes for the users to perceive that latter as legitimate, that is for
the users to willingly comply to them (Baland & Plateau, 1996).

Another comerstone in sustaining institutional arrangements in CPRs would be
the monitoring and sanctioning mechanism that is put in place to see to it that they arc
complied with. Basically, this component is another tool that provides assurance to the
interacting users that they will not be suckers if they will follow the rules. Monitoring and
sanctioning are able to do this by breaking the logic of the backward-induction argument
underlying the non-cooperative outcome of the finitely repeated game which is the result
when penalties are meted to defectors thus making defection less beneficial than
cooperation in whatever period of the game (Baland & Plateau, 1996). As such,
monitoring and sanctioning is especially important in the context of large groups since in
the absence of the advantages of a small group, such as easy observability of actions,
continuity of interactions, and easy communication of the members, or the strong
influence of moral norms, coercion (i.e. in the form of monitoring and sanctioning) is the
only device that can make rational, self-interested individuals act in their common

interest (Olson, 1965 as cited by Baland & Platteau, 1996).

On sanctioning, to foster cooperation, penalties must be meted gradually,
especially in cases involving imperfect information. This is done especially for first time

offenses in consideration of the possibility that the supposed offender might not have

27

committed the offense; thus avoiding raising resentment from those who are indeed
unfairly punished and their subsequent unwillingness to follow rules in the future.
However, as repetition of the same offense is attributed to the same individual,

application of harsher and harsher penalties becomes justified. But even if information is

perfect, graduated sanctioning is still ideal since more than punishing offenders, the
purpose of sanctions is to remind or warn individuals of the importance of compliance.
Again, just like with imperfect information, graduated sanctioning in this case avoids
raising resentment and unwillingness to conform to rules in the future resulting from
meting large fine or harsh punishment on a person facing an unusual problem (Ostrom,
1990). Thus, according to Ostrom (1990) graduated punishments ranging from
insignificant fines all the way to banishment, applied in settings in which sanctioners
know a great deal about the personal circumstances of the other appropriators and the
potential harm that could be created by excessive sanctions, may be far more effective

than a major fine imposed on a first offender.

Apparently, detection of free-riding in many field settings is difficult and costs
have to be incurred to make it possible. As such, the task of monitoring and imposing
sanctions could be entrusted to an external authority. But as already pointed above, when
there is imperfect information or imperfect monitorability, the sanctioners, which in this
case is the external authority, cannot avoid making errors in imposing punishments. If
this is what is happening, the dominant strategy of the users can revert back to defection
or violation of the imposed rules especially if there is a high chance that the external
authority will impose sanctions incorrectly, meaning there is a high probability for

violators to escape punishments. To make monitoring effective in this case or when there

28

is imperfect monitorability, high amounts of penalties or severe punishments should be
meted out to violators; that is, the more costly the monitoring, the higher the penalty must
be to induce rule compliance. But considering that high or harsh penalties can produce
resentment and non-compliance of rules, not to mention the weakening of social pressure
against violators when they are perceived to be unfair or unjustified, lessening the
imperfectability of the monitoring process is more advisable. This is since it can lower
the cost of monitoring when it is conducted and therefore decrease the degree of penalty
needed to sanction violators. To do this, it is advisable whenever viable that the group
size be taken advantage of for monitoring. Which means that if applicable, the
monitoring this function be delegated to the community itself or to its local authorities.
Monitoring costs can also be reduced by shifting to methods of resource conservation that
are relatively easy to check out (Baland & Platteau, 1996). An example of this would be
using the less costly to monitor “gear restriction method” over the highly contestable and
therefore more costly “control of individual vessel quotas method” or “minimum-

size/weight restrictions” (Sutinen, ef. al., 1990 as cited in Baland & Platteau, 1996).

But even if monitoring will be delegated to the community, imperfect
monitorability is still expected to happen resulting in what is pointed out above as a
resurgence of cheating as a viable strategy. This is so since monitoring by the users is a
positive function of the relative cost of monitoring with respect to the expected benefits,
while cheating is a positive function of its benefit relative to its expected cost. Thus, the
striking result is that, at equilibrium, cheating always occurs with positive probability,
and yet the cheaters themselves are not monitored. This happens as monitoring is only

profitable if there is a positive chance to prevent a cheating event; if no cheating occurs,

29

the costs of monitoring outweighs its benefit thus producing the imperfect monitorability
in this case. On the other hand, cheating is always profitable if no monitoring occurs

(Weissing & Ostrom, 1991 as cited by Baland & Platteau, 1996).

If the users will employ the service of specialized guards, the resource system
might become efficient, although this is not always the case, due to the rates of cheating
and monitoring being decreased. However, due to the presence of the specialized agents,
the incentive of the users to monitor each others’ behavior may also be reduced thus
changing the monitoring game being played by the users from being an assurance game

into a chicken game (Weissing & Ostrom, 1991 as cited by Baland & Platteau, 1996).

If monitoring is solely tasked to the users, cheating rate may increase as a result of
an increase in the number of group members. Basically produced by incentive dilution
problem, this happens since the total benefit of detection of a cheating event is evenly
spread among all users, whether they monitor or not. As a result, the individual benefit
from monitoring and detection decreases with the number of users thus creating the
incentive, when the group size is big, to shirk or free-ride (Weissing & Ostrom, 1991 as
cited by Baland & Platteau, 1996). However, large group size is not the only condition
that triggers cheating rate movement; in fact it can be decreased if a) the detection
probability of monitoring is increased such as when conservation methods that are easy to
monitor are used; b) the cost of monitoring, which is a function of the first condition, is
decreased; c) the size of penalty, which is a function of the second condition, is also
decreased; and d) when the loss of benefit due to undetected cheating is reduced (Baland

& Plateau, 1996).

30

Users who willingly follow rules are assumed to do so because they perceive that
the latter enhance their benefits from the CPR. Thus, it is necessary that the rules need
not be unclear and ambiguous since these creates misunderstanding about the policy and
distrust on its implementors which can account for non-cooperative behavior among
individuals even in the contexts where they could apparently benefit from the resource
policy (Baland & Platteau, 1996). However, it must be emphasized that this realization of
the benefits of a policy can happen ex ante; which means, that the users could be against
the regulation and actively oppose it ex ante due to perceived uncertainty on how it will
affect them, even though such rules are really beneficial and in fact will be supported by
majority of the users ex post. It can also happen that the users may perceive that a
regulation is beneficial ex ante only to find out ex post that it is not resulting in the retum

of the original situation (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

Type of Societies in CPR Management

As had already been pointed above, some communities are characterized
simultaneously by the presence of flexible access rules and the absence of conservation
mechanisms. These are those communities which live amidst abundant natural resources
defined as resources for which there is no competition and which cannot be threatened
with the risk of degradation even when they are openly accessible. A state of resource
abundance may be related to three main kinds of circumstances which are a) population

size is restricted compared to the amount of available resources, b) technology is

31

primitive with the result is quite low and or the cost of exploiting a certain range of the
available resources tends to infinity, and c) the users are not profit-maximizers because
they produce mainly for subsistence purposes and have a marked preference for leisure or

leisurely activities (Baland & Plateau, 1996).

In this type of community, conservation rules would not flourish considering that
the resource at stake is not under strain thus defeating any conservation effort by its
unnecessary cost. On the part of the access rules, which are flexible, they are devised
irrespective of the degree of pressure on those resources; instead their presence largely
depends on whether control of access to localized resources is feasible at a reasonable
cost. Nonetheless, the degree of flexibility of such rules is very much a function of the
extent of resource availability. That is, they tend to be highly flexible and to be applied in
a liberal way when pressure on the resource is low while they tend to be more narrowly
interpreted and more strictly applied when pressure on the resource heightens. In fact, the
purpose of access rules in this case is to manifest and symbolize the social identity of the
group which first colonized the area where these resources are located as well as
articulate its corporate ownership structure as well as to establish political intergroup

boundaries (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

When low productivity is experienced by the users, a change in the characteristic
of the community will manifest. In some communities this change will be that the access

tules will become strict but still no rules pertaining to conservation are devised.

As mentioned above, the decline in the average product or the increase in the

average cost resulting from the pressure of a growing number of resource harvesters,

32

assuming constant technology, may be due a) only to the enhanced competition for the
resource that this growing pressure entails, or b) both of this enhanced competition and to
the erosion of the environmental capital stock. The first situation points to a purely
distributive problem caused by the very scarcity: since the resources are increasingly
difficult or costly to harvest, there arises the question as to how the cost of extracting it is
to be shared among the various claimants. Such a situation therefore requires well-
defined sharing rules which are obviously tantamount to access rules. The second
situation involves both a distribution problem and a genuine resource management
problem. Consequently, it calls not only for sharing rules but also for conservation
mechanisms in case the pressure on the resource, other things being equals, should
become stronger in the future than in the present (Baland & Platteau, 1996). But because
societies, especially those hunter-gatherer type, are prone to misunderstand or not
correctly perceive the nature of the problem at stake, not to mention the collective action
problem that can arise when the members interact, they may not optimally adjust to the
evolving challenges that they face (McNicoll, 1990 & Lane, 1991 as cited in Baland &
Plateau, 1996). What this means is that, in some societies it is a natural inclination for
the members to think that, when their income derived from the exploitation of CPRs
happens to fall, this must be entirely caused by the encroachments of new producers,
especially so, of course, if the latter are strangers endowed with superior techniques,
whose activities have the effect of diminishing the share of the current resource flows
available to the existing users. In this context, the idea that decreasing incomes can also
follow from reduced stock of the resource as a result of over exploitation and

mismanagement by all producers involved does not readily come to people’s mind. When

33

this condition happens, the community therefore tends to adopt strict access rules while

neglecting to evolve conservation devices (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

Therefore, in this type of society, where the understanding and perception of the
problem only reaches the level wherein low productivity is caused by enhanced
competition for the resource, and not caused by the lowering of the stock due the users
action, the spontaneous reaction of the local community is a) to tighten the rules of access
so as to make it more and more difficult for outsiders to use the CPR, and b) to design
more precise rules for the sharing of access and the avoidance of conflicts among the
growing number of insider users; the latter process may involve de facto privatization of

use rights or some sort of rotation (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

However, it is not always the case that a user community’s level of understanding
of scarcity or low productivity is pigeonholed to that level as described above. In fact,
some kinds of communities lean better or more quickly than others on how to adjust to a
changing environment. Agricultural communities, in which members can have
perceptions of their relationships with the surrounding environment that are more
conducive to resource management practices, represent such. And because such
communities have CPR resources that are not anymore abundant and at the same time
have members that perceive themselves as important determinants of ecological change
when resources are liable to degradation, strict access rules and conservation rules are

characteristically adopted (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

But in order for these conservation rules to be devised and adopted, the users

themselves must first become aware of the ecological problems created by their actions.

34

However, even the latter is not enough since if the users become aware of the problem
too late, that is, only when the appropriate incentives to conservation measures have
already disappeared, effective resource management responses are unlikely to succeed
(although still possible with the help of special incentives provided by an external
agency). Thus it is important that the awareness of the users must not be too slow, which
is unfortunately its usual pace. To remedy this, what is required is for the users to have a)
concrete, visible experiences of depletion or degradation in order to be stimulated, b) an
understanding of the situation wherein the connection between their behavior and the
level of the stock is made evident, and c) a “sense of limits” in their minds coming from
previous experiences of scarcity. In other words, the problem effects must be highly
visible in order for the people to realize what is happening; words, abstract reasoning and
explanations do not have much impact here. This is the reason why the emergence of
such awareness depends on the physical and geographical nature of the resource. It will
thus more easily emerge with respect to localized, visible, and predictable resources than
in the case of a resource that stretches over vast and seasonally changing geographic

areas, is largely unpredictable, and hardly visible (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

In the case of coastal fisheries what needs to be stressed, however, is that if
communities of inshore fishermen are frequently found to have regulation regarding
fishing gear, fishing season and the rotation or assignment of a favored fishing location,
they typically fail to regulate the total pressure on the stock of fish by restricting
harvesting efforts itself. This failure can be ascribed to both informational problems,
being that it is easier to monitor a vessel’s gear and location or whether a closed-season

regulation is violated than to monitor the individual catches of many vessels, and to the

35

heterogencity of fishermen communities regarding endowments (Schlager, 1990 as cited

in Baland & Platteau, 1996).

CHAPTER III

METHODOLOGY

Description of the Study Area

Laguna de Bay is the largest and most important lake in the Philippines. It is
located in the southern part of the island of Luzon entrenched in the most populous
region of the country, which includes the provinces of Rizal, Laguna, most parts of Metro
Manila, and parts of Cavite, Batangas and Quezon (Barril & Tumlos, 2010; Quintos,
2007). It has a total surface area of 900 km? and a watershed of 2,920 km?, There are 29
municipalities and cities that are surrounding the lake (Quintos, 2007) and the total

population in its watershed is estimated to be close to 20 million (LLDA, n.d.).

Calamba City, which is located in the southem side of Laguna de Bay, is a first
class city in the Second District of the province of Laguna. It is located 54 km south of
Manila (City profile, 2015) and has a land area of around 144 km? making it the second
largest city in the province next to San Pablo City. It has 54 barangays with a total

population of 389, 377 as of 2010.

The current study was conducted in Barangay Bucal of Calamba City (Figure 2).

The barangay, which is one of the ten coastal barangays of the city and has an artisanal

37

fisher-population of moderate size, was chosen primarily because of its accessibility, the
availability of secondary data on its artisanal fishing, industry, and the presence of the

city’s fish sanctuary in its offshore area.

Barangay Bucal (14°11'8"N, 121°10'13"E) has a total land area of 2.65 km? and is
divided into six puroks. It is classified as urban and is bounded by Barangay La Mesa in
the West, Laguna de Bay in the East, Barangay Pansol in the South and Barangay Halang,
in the North. It is 57 km south of Manila and is reachable using chartered bus via the

South Luzon Expressway. As of 2010, Barangay Bucal has a total population of 11, 346.

Figure 2. Terrain map showing Barangay Bucal, Calamba City, Laguna,
Philippines

38

Based on a fishing industry study, Barangay Bucal has 22 inland fish-pond
farmers occupying a total area of 1.041 ha, four fish farmers engaged in fish-caging using
a total area of 1.03 ha, and 73 fishers engaged in artisanal fishing (CASD, 2012).
However, as of 2014, the number of artisanal fishers has decreased to 56 fishers (CASD,

2014)

The fish sanctuary situated in the barangay’s water is a 5 ha-offshore area within
the 300 m-protected zone of Barangay Bucal (Appendix D). The said protected area had
already been inspected by LLDA and is considered as “strategic” as small fishes are

observed to retreat it

it. There is also an abundance of submerged aquatic plants like
digman (Hydrilla verticillata) and sintas (Vallisnaria gigantia) in the said area which
could indicate that it still enjoys relatively clean waters (Appendix D). At the same time,
the sanctuary is also supplied with fresh water coming from onshore natural springs
(CASD, 2014). Bamboo poles had been put up every 1.5 m along its perimeter (Appendix
D) to delineate the area it covers in the fishery. This provides a well-defined boundary
that is easy to observe by both artisanal fishers and Bantay Lawa fishwardens. At the
same time, the bamboo pole-fence also serves as physical barrier against errant fishers
who wishes to harvest within the protected area. This, however, is not the case for the
perimeter of the 300 m-protected zone extending the entire coastline of Calamba City, on

which no physical markers are put in place.

Aside from the fish sanctuary, the offshore area in Barangay Bucal also holds the
Calamba City Fish Garden and Sanctuary. This installation has two components

(Appendix D). The first is the sanctuary described above that is classified as an

39

“exclusive protected area”. The second component is the Yankaw Fish Garden which is
the livelihood component of the project. In the latter, yankaws, which are forms of bubo
or fish shelters composed of cut branches of Camachile tree (Pithecellobium dulce), are
strategically placed inside the “garden”. The fish garden, similar to the fish sanctuary, has
a total area of 5 ha. Thus, the total area covered by the Calamba City Fish Garden and

Sanctuary add up to 10 hectares (CASD, 2014).

For its political boundary, the fishery used by the artisanal fishers of Barangay
Bucal falls under the jurisdiction of the LLDA being the lead government agency that has
an unequivocal mandate to manage the Laguna de Bay watershed (Santos-Borja, n.d.)
However, equally comprehensive in its ability to affect the general welfare of the fishery,
but limited in its territorial reach, are the Provincial Government of Laguna, the City
Government of Calamba, and the Barangay Government of Barangay Bucal each of
which has vested power to oversee and decide on environmental concems under Republic

Act 7160 or the 1991 Local Government Code of the Philippines (Gomez, 2014).

Research Design

The study is divided into two phases. The first phase is the preliminary
investigation phase wherein background data pertaining to the artisanal fishing industry
of Barangay Bucal was taken. Following this is the formal survey phase where data on

the socioeconomic characteristics of the fishers, their perceptions of the different

exogenous factors, and perceptions of their consistency in complying with the formal

choice rules were collected.

In the preliminary investigation phase, semi-structured interview method was
used to get valuable information from key informants. This was used in producing,
together with the information coming from the analysis of collected secondary data and
reconnaissance survey, a quick but preliminary profile of the artisanal fishing activity in
the study area. Key informants from the community and local government were identified
and interviewed pertaining the spatial (e.g. fishing grounds and protected area locations),
temporal (e.g. species and gear seasonality), flow (e.g. policy making, adjudication and
marketing of fish catch) and decision (e.g. organization of the fishers, formal and

informal rules, overall compliance to the rules) patterns involved in the said activity.

However, in the formal survey phase, the collection of data was done primarily
through structured interviews of all the artisanal fishers in Barangay Bucal which were
identified using a master list from CASD. Interviews on both phases were conducted in
Tagalog and responses were recorded in the same language. The unit of analysis for this

study is the artisanal fishers of Barangay Bucal.

41

Research Instrument

Semi-structured interview schedules were used in gathering data during the
preliminary investigation phase. In the formal survey phase, structured interview
schedules were used to collect data on all three primary topics: the fishers’ socio-
economic characteristics, their perceptions regarding the exogenous factors, and their
perceptions regarding their compliance to the formal as well as to the informal choice

rules. The aforementioned interview schedules were developed in Tagalog.

In the interview schedule for the formal survey, questionnaire items that were
designed to elicit socioeconomic characteristics of the fishers were followed by prepared
sets of possible objective responses from which the respondents can choose options that
best suggest their socio-economic characteristics. The rest of the questionnaire items
however were Likert items that used Likert-type scales having an ordered continuum of
response categories. As these items primarily focus on perceptions rather than attitudes,
the Likert-type scales in this case did not use the traditional strongly disagree to strongly
agree response continuum; instead frequency, intensity and quantity response categories

were used.

Furthermore, aside from using an ordered continuum of response categories, the
study’s Likert-type scales also presented a balanced number of positive and negative
options. At the same time, descriptive labels were assigned to each category in the scale.

However, the numeric values of the response categories for the mode of compliance to

42

each of the formal and informal choice rules, which were used during the analysis part,

did not appear in the research instruments.

Methods of Analysis

‘After the survey was conducted, frequency counts and percentages were used to
summarize the socio-economic characteristics of the fishers, the characteristics of the

different exogenous factors, the fishers’ compliance to the formal and informal choice

61

tules, and the different forms of incompliance to these. In quantitatively describing the
prevailing characteristics of the socioeconomic and exogenous factors, primary
characteristics were identified for each of the factors. In this case, primary characteristics
are understood as the response category in a given factor with majority corresponding

respondents or the configuration of response categories that can first reach majority.

Bar graphs were used to compare the number of catchers, frequent catchers, and
sellers of the different species harvested, as well as the number of users, frequent users
and owners of the different fishing gears and vessels used in the fishery. Line graphs on
the other hand were used to compare the observability of the different banned methods of

artisanal fishing.

The equivalent numerical values of the respodents” mode of compliance to each
of the six formal choice rules covered in the study were summed to determine their
respective Compliance Index (Cl) to the formal choice rules. As such the following

formula was used:

Cl= Livi

Where:

Cl = Compliance Index

V = Numerical value of the respondents mode of compliance to a
given formal/informal choice rule

62

Considering that never breaking a formal choice rule has a numerical value of
three, occasionally breaking a formal choice rule gets a numerical value of two, and
frequently breaking a formal choice rule gets a numerical value of one, a CI of 18
therefore signifies that a respondent has never broken any of the formal choice rules,
while an index below this indicates some configuration of incompliance. Consequently, a

Cl of six indicates frequent incompliance to all of the formal choice rules.

The population Cl mean, median and skewness were then used to describe the
asymmetry of the CI data for the population of Barangay Bucal artisanal fishers. To
graphically represent the said asymmetry, the distribution of probability functions of the
Cl was used. For comparison of the different types of choice rules, the respondent’s Cl
for the informal choice rules were also derived using the same procedure. Similarly,
skewness along with the population Cl mean and median was also used to describe the

asymmetry in the distribution of the latter.

Phi (g) was used in determining the socio-economic and exogenous factors that
were strongly associated with the fishers’ consistent compliance to the formal choice
rules. In proceeding with the correlation analysis, some of the nominal and ordinal data
for the socioeconomic and exogenous factors have to be collapsed and dichotomized to
fit 2x2 contingency tables. The fishers’ modes of compliance to the formal choice rules
were also dichotomized wherein those having a Cl of 18 were classified as consistenly
complying with the said rules while those having less than 18 were classified as being
inconsistenly complying. Furthermore, simple logistic regression was utilized to

determine how the strongly associated factors (i.e. those with g > 0.3) identified were

63

associated with the fishers’ consistent compliance to the formal choice rules as well as

their odds ratios of doing so.

Pairwise association using phi was then used to determine the degree of
associations between the identified factors. After which, simple logistic regression was
again used to determine how the strongly associated factors were associated with cach

other.

CHAPTER IV

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Characteristics of the Socioeconomic and
Exogenous Factors used in the Study

Socioeconomic Characteristics of the
Artisanal Fisher Community

The number of artisanal fisher population in Barangay Bucal appears to be on a
state of decline. In 2012, the population totaled 73 fishers (CASD, 2013). This dropped to
56 in 2014 (CASD, 2014) and 42 in 2015. The lack of interest of the younger generation
in artisanal fishing as suggested by a low number of young fishermen (< 30 years old)
fishing with older artisanal fishers could be causing such a decline. Table | shows that
majority of the artisanal fishers (52.38%) are old (2 51 years old) while in Appendix A
middle-aged artisanal fishers (31 to 50 years old) are shown to comprise 42.86% of the
population; this leaves only 4.76% of the population that is composed of young
fishermen. Consistent with this, only very few artisanal fishers (11.91%) were also found
to be engaging in artisanal fishing for minimal number of years (< 14 years) as compared

to those who have been in the industry for a short (15 to 30 years) and intermediate (31 to

65

45 years) number of years which comprise 38.10% and 28.60% of the population

respectively.

Low immigration of artisanal fishers into Barangay Bucal could also be
contributing to the said decline. This is underscored by the results showing that majority
of the fishers (76.19%) are native to the barangay and a total of 80.96% of the fishers
have resided there for an extended (31 to 45 years), long (46 to 60 years) and very long
(© 60 years) periods of time as compared to only 19.05% that have lived there for

minimal number of years (15 to 30 years).

In terms of their wealth, most of the fishers (66.67%) exhibit minimal (1 to 3
household furnishings) to low (4 to 6 household furnishings) wealth levels as indicated
by the number of household furnishings they have. This is consistent with the results of
the other wealth indicators used in the study except for house structure type. As such,
most of the fishers also do not own a parcel of land (83.33%) or motorized banca

(73.81%).

Characteristics of the Exogenous Factors

Characteristics of the resource-related factors. Table 2 shows that most of the
artisanal fishers (61.91%) perceived the physicochemical condition of the open-lake
fishery as bad. As such, these fishers regarded the physicochemical deterioration of the
open-lake fishery as serious but considered its rehabilitation possible. Many of the fishers
blamed this condition to the pollution occurring in the lake while some attributed it to the
reduction and shallowing of the open-lake fishing area. In general, the fishers’ open-
ended responses on the factors underlying such bad condition are consistent with
previous literatures and observations indirectly showing deterioration of the
physicochemical condition of the water in Barangay Bucal.

In relation to pollution, the LLDA has classified the lake water of the barangay as
Class C based on DAO 1990-34 (Herrera, ef. al., 2011; LLDA, n.d.). This makes it
inviable for primary contact recreational activities and as a source of water supply.
Barangay Bucal though is not highly exposed to pollution loading being in the South Bay
of Laguna de Bay unlike the heavily industrialized North-West sub-basins (PEMSEA, et.
al., 2013). Still, domestic wastes find their way into the fishery through the tributaries
which are used as receptacles by the residents for their kitchen and other household
wastes (Appendix D). As indicated by the fishers and reflected in their community-based
risk maps (Concepcion, ef. al., 2014), the loading of pollutants into the fishery is most
pronounced at the outset of the dry season, around the month of April, continuing into the

wet season, particularly after episodes of heavy rain, until the month of August. The

fishers call the rain-induced flush of dirty black water that characterize pollution loading

during this time as burak (Appendix D).

In terms of congestion of the fishing area, CASD (2012) recorded 153.88 ha of
fishpens and fishcages within the municipal waters of Calamba City, aside from the 10-ha

Fish Sanctuary/Fish Garden withii

it. However, most of these structures including the
sanctuary are located in the barangay waters of Barangay Sucol, Pansol, Bucal, Lecheria,
Paglingon and Linga which covers the fishing grounds comprising the open-lake fishery

of the artisanal fishers of Barangay Bucal. These structures are hampering the harvesting

of artisanal fishers. In the study of Concepcion, et. al. (n.d.), it is shown that fish catches
of artisanal fishers in the unoccupied fishing grounds of Calamba City are almost double

to those in occupied ones.

In terms of shallowing of the fishing area, LLDA and the University of the
Philippines (1999) as cited by Ynares (2006) had shown that in the past 45 years, 65.00%
of the Laguna de Bay area have already underwent shoaling, especially the west and
central lobes. Romeo Tappalla (personal communication, July 18, 2015), a long-time
artisanal fisher and the chairman of the Barangay Fisheries and Aquatic Resources
Management Council (BFARMC) in Barangay Bucal, estimated that the water in their
area could have already shoaled from around 9 m in the 1970's to around 3 m at the
present. Accordingly, a water and sediment sampling of the fish sanctuary and its nearby
fishing grounds by the City Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management Council
(CFARMC) has found that the mean depth of the fishery is at 2.25 m with the maximum

and minimum depths at 3.3 m and 1.3 m respectively (Concepcion, ef. al., 2014).

69

A strong general trend of declining fish catch in all types of fisheries in Laguna de
Bay has occurred in the last 20 years (Santos-Borja & Nepomuceno, 2006). Although,
there is no previous study specifically analyzing the decline of fish catch in Barangay
Bucal, its artisanal fishers have indicated of experiencing such in the past. According to
them, their fish catch had decreased so severely by the year 2008 to 2010 that they only
had enough volume of fish catch immediately after typhoon occurrences which usually
happen in the months of June to November (Lacanilao, 1987; Concepcion, ef. al., 2014).
Accordingly, CASD (2012), has estimated that the catch of the city’s artisanal fishers had
sunk to I kg per fishing trip in the past before it had improved in the recent years. In the
study, 50.00% of the fishers perceived that they are still able to harvest sufficient fish
catch from the fishery, with a few (11.91%) even indicating that their catch is more than
enough. The fishers had reported that at the present, the volume of their fish catch per

fishing trip ranges from | to 10 kg.

As described above, the open-lake fishery of the artisanal fishers in Barangay
Bucal is composed of the contiguous fishing grounds of Barangay Linga, Paglingon,
Lecheria, Bucal, Pansol, and Sucol, aside from the fishing ground around Pulo ng
Calamba (i.e.”Wonder Island”) which is only accessible by those with motorized banca
(Appendix D). As such, 50.00% of the artisanal fishers has found the total size of the
open-lake fishery to be large while more than a quarter (31.00%) indicate it to be
imermediate. Such result could therefore explain why for most of the artisanal fishers
(69.10%), observing the activities of all the fishers using the fishery at any one time is
difficult. This is because according to Schlager (1990) and Wade (1988), as cited in

Baland and Platteau (2006), large ecological resources with its greater dimension

70

constrains the senses of its users from directly detecting the actions of the other resource
users. However, almost all of the artisanal fishers (95.24%) find it relatively quick and
easy to observe the perimeter of the Fish Sanctuary. This is expected since the 5-ha
sanctuary within the 300-m protected zone of Barangay Bucal is demarcated by bamboo

poles set at 1.5 m from each other.

Currently, five methods of artisanal fishing are considered to be prohibited in the
fishery. These are: the use of tibog in catching fish; the use of dredge in catching snails;
the use of motorized push net; and, the use of fine mesh net and electrofishing gears.
About 57.24% of the respondents indicated that all of these banned methods are
observable, while almost two-thirds indicated that only some are. Further analysis
indicates that most of the 15 respondents that perceived incomplete observability
suggested the use of electrofishing gears as the most difficult to observe while the use of
tibog as the easiest. This result is consistent with reports of the Bantay Lawa Task Force.
‘A quick scan of their log records from September 10, 2014 to September 15, 2015
revealed that tibog-use was the most frequently reported violation. In the said period, the
use of tibog had been reported not less than 26 times whereas the use of electrofishing

gears had only been reported once. Many fishers indicated that the use of ribog is easiest

to observe because it involves striking the water with bamboo rods creating loud noises
that can be heard from a distance. Electrofishing gears on the other hand are difficult to
monitor since they are largely used in the peripheral, marshy littoral parts of the lake and
other inland inundated areas, including creeks, which are far removed from other fishers

and Bantay Lawa fishwardens. The fact that electrofishing can also be done at night also

adds to the difficulty of it being observed.

n

Artisanal fishing in Barangay Bucal is largely focused on catching tilapia
(Oreochromis sp.). All of the species included in the survey were found to have catchers
among the artisanal fishers (Appendix A); however, only tilapia (73.81%), Laguna de
Bay catfish (Arius manilensis; 57.14%) and to some extent, white shrimp
(Macrobrachium sp.; 26.19%) have significant number of frequent catchers. As it is,
these three species are all perennial, considered abundant in the fishery and, except for
Laguna de bay catfish, have high market values (Appendix C). Laguna de bay catfish’s
high number of frequent catchers could be due to its susceptibility of being
unintentionally caught along with tilapia as the two species are found in the same area in
the fishery, exist during the same time of the year, and are caught using the same type of
fishing gears (Appendix C). Incidentally, however, there is a comparatively low fishing
demand for Laguna de Bay catfish as shown by the fact that despite of it being one of the
species with the most number of frequent catchers, it is also one of those with the least
number of sellers (28.57%). Many of the artisanal fishers attribute this to the strong.
ramish taste of Laguna de Bay catfish that they usually just give it away or return it to the
lake when it happens to be included in their catch. On the other hand, the result also
shows that only a quarter of the fishers (26.19%) are frequently catching white shrimps
despite its availability in the fishery throughout the year and high market price due to its

capital and labour intensiveness.

Among the different fishing gears used, gillnet, which is the primary gear for
catching tilapia, has the most number of frequent users (83.33%) along with non-
motorized banca (64.29%). Gillnet is followed by tibog with a little over one-fifth of the

respondents (21.43%) indicated of frequently using it (Appendix A). This underscores the

2

close relationship between the two gears. According to the fishers, all ribog users are also
gillnet users, since the former is used to scare fishes into gillncts; however, not all gillnet
users are tibog users. According to the respondents, the most important utilization of
tibog happens in the months of May and June when catching fish using gillnet becomes
very difficult as the level of water in the fishery is at its lowest. However, frequent tibog
users, or those that use the said gear in more than half of their total fishing trips in a year,

represent a slight majority of the entire tibog users in Barangay Bucal (Table 6).

Characteristics of the resource user-related factors. Table 3 shows that majority of

the fishers (59.52%) perceived their ecological knowledge of the open-lake fishery as low

despite that most of them have been fishers in the area for about 15 years to more than 60

74

years (Appendix A). In the context of the deterioration that has happened in Laguna de
Bay over the years (Santos-Borja & Nepomuceno, 2006), such result is consistent with
previous literature showing that in resources that have changed rapidly during recent
decades, their users are likely to be imperfectly informed about its ongoing processes of
depletion and degradation (Baland & Plateau, 1996). In terms of the similarity of their
interests in the management of the fishery, most of the artisanal fishers (54.76%)
indicated heterogeneity of views. In relation to this, the most commonly noted polarizing,
issues included the need to follow management rules and the establishment of the fish
sanctuary in the barangay’s water. Such heterogeneity is to be expected since previous
literature has shown that low levels of understanding and perception of ecological
problems could make it difficult for the acceptance and adoption of conservation rules
(Baland & Platteau, 1996). Nevertheless, most of the artisanal fishers claimed sufficient
other-regarding behavior among themselves as shown in the results where most of them
felt sufficient care from other fishers (85.71%) and most of them sufficiently care for the
well-being of other fishers (76.19%). Moreover, most of them have also indicated of
continued complete adhesion to the present rules even if there is rampant violation of it
(90.48%). This could indicate the existence of a sufficient set of moral norms among the
fishers. This is consistent with previous literature showing that when moral norms are
well-established and sustained by primary and secondary socialization, resource users
tend to a) to adopt others’ viewpoint when making decisions that may harm others’
interests and to feel internally rewarded when behaving in other-regarding ways; b) to be

confident that others will abide by the same code of good behaviors as themselves; and c)

75

to cling to this code even when they had unpleasant experiences in which they had been

suckered (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

In terms of the size of the fishery-users, majority (66.67%) of the respondents
perceived a large number of fishers is using “their” fishery. ‘These fishers related such
perception to the intrusions of “outsiders”. These outsiders include artisanal fishers from
Barangays Masili, Sucol, Pansol, Lecheria, and Sampiruhan as well as Sitio Rongot and
Aplaya, Barangay Lingga and from as far as Binangonan, Rizal. With the absence of any
working physical boundary that specifically delineates an exclusive fishery for the
artisanal fishers of Barangay Bucal, they will have to share their fishing grounds with
other fishers. However, almost all of the fishers (97.62%) find such arrangement
acceptable with 39.02% in this group indicated that all of the fishers should be allowed
entry into the fishery since they are just trying to earn a living while 26.83% cited that
access should be given to all since inevitably every artisanal fisher has to move around
the fishery due to the fact that the fishes themselves are not stationary to a single fishing
ground. In light of the previous result whereby majority of the fishers are still able to
harvest sufficient fish catch from the fishery, and that majority (73.81%) also perceived
no unfair harvesting happening in the fishery, the observed general favorability to the
open-access condition of the fishery could therefore imply that most of the fishers find
the fishes within the said resource as still abundant. Baland and Platteau (1996), defined
abundant natural resources as resources for which there is no competition and which

cannot be threatened with the risk of degradation even when they are openly accessible.

76

In terms of the availability of a communication mechanism among the artisanal
fishers, almost all of the respondents (92.86%) indicated that such mechanism is present
with 74.16% citing the meetings of Barangay Fisheries and Aquatic Resources
Management Council/Sagisag ng mga Mangingisda ng Barangay Bucal
(BFARMC/SAMBBU) as a form of this mechanism. These meetings of the
BFARMC/SAMBBU are conducted on a monthly basis. The first of these is the meeting
between the officers of the association scheduled every first Sunday of the month. The
second meeting is a general assembly to be attended by all bonafide members of
BFARMC/SAMBBU scheduled every last Sunday of the month. This is the avenue
where the fisherfolks in the barangay, including the artisanal fishers, are given the chance
to voice their concems and opinions regarding the fishery. It is also in these meetings
where suggestions are given and plans are formed for programs and projects that could be
pursued by the fisherfolks through FARMC in conjunction with the City Government of
Calamba. Aside from these, any member of the fisherfolk association can call an
emergency meeting when there is a project that needs to be done or an issue that needs
immediate attention (CASD, 2014). Notices of meetings are disseminated to the member
fisherfolks through official invitation from the PIO of the association or through text

messages (Romeo Tapalla, personal communication, July 18, 2015).

However, despite the perceived access to a communication mechanism, majority
of the respondents (73.81%) still find that gathering the fishers into these fishery-related
meetings as difficult. Since most of the respondents perceived a large number of fishers
using the fishery, this result is consistent with previous literature showing that pre-play

communication among actors in large groups tend to be relatively difficult, hence the

7

higher communication and bargaining costs in such groups (Olson, 1982 as cited in
Baland & Platteau, 1996). In terms of the frequency of meetings, the study found that
majority of the artisanal fishers (66.67%) perceived the meetings to be infrequent despite
the regularly scheduled BFARMC/SAMBBU general assembly. As for their personal
attendance during these scheduled meetings, 45.24% of the artisnal fishers have only
occasional presence while around one-fifth (21.43%) are always absent or have never
attended any of the meetings. This result therefore supports the above observation that

gathering the fishers into their meetings is indeed difficult.

An analysis of the data on the proportion of the respondents’ household income
coming from artisanal fishing shows that majority (57.14%) have low dependence (i.e.
less than one-half of total household income) on artisanal fishing as an income source.
The high level of occupational multiplicity among the open-lake fishers and their other
household members is indicative of this. As it is, majority of the respondents (73.81%)
are shown to have non-artisanal fishing occupations. The most commonly noted of which
are farming and working in construction sites. The same is also true for the other
household members of most of the respondents (78.57%) of which the most commonly
noted occupation is working in factories. The analysis of the proportion of the
respondents’ household income derived from non-artisanal fishing also shows that
majority of the households (52.38%) are more highly dependent on non-artisanal fishing
occupations as source of income. This result supports the above-observation of the
majority of the respondents indicating that their household incomes have low dependence
on artisanal fishing and are therefore more dependent on their non-artisanal fishing

occupations excluding remittances. Remittances are not a major source of income for the

78

artisanal fishers as almost all (85.71%) indicated of not having access to it. Of those that

do, most indicated low dependence only.

Almost all of the respondents (92.86%) perceived that they would still be engaged
in artisanal fishing within the same fishery five years from the present. Majority of them
(66.67%) also express desire to retain artisanal fishing if given the chance to live their
lives all over again. The most commonly noted reasons for this include: the ability of
artisanal fishing to guarantee food for the family; its ability to improve the well-being of
the fishers; it is the livelihood they are used to; and that artisanal fishers serve no
employer. As for an inclination of changing at the present their artisanal fishing
‘occupation to something else, a much lower number of the respondents (52.38%)
indicated that they will not. In the case of those that are open to scrapping artisanal
fishing, most would opt to because they perceived that it cannot guarantee them a stable
income. However, the willingness of some is conditional. That is, they will only abandon
artisanal fishing if any of the following conditions are met: the new job provides a bigger
income; if they are still capable of performing the new job; and if the new job does not
make them part from their families. These responses to the two questions - one
hypothetical (future) and the other current — indicate some slight ambivalence on the part
of the respondents pertaining to their satisfaction derived from artisanal fishing as an
occupation (Katon, ef. al., 1997). As seen in the results, more than three-fifth of the open-
lake fishers indicated they would still choose artisanal fishing if they were to live their
lives all over again. Yet only half of the respondents would like to stay in artisanal
fishing at the present. An examination of the underlying reasons indicates that although

the artisanal fishers of Barangay Bucal are satisfied with the economic and psychological

benefits of fishing as an occupation, they are open to other possibilities that can improve
their economic condition at the present. This could have been the result of their exposure

to other options over time and their willingness to try other options (Katon, et. al., 1997).

At the present, artisanal fishing in Barangay Bucal is largely done for income
generation with most of the fishers (66.67%) selling their fish catch directly in the
barangay. However, white-shrimp catchers sell their catch in Calamba City as a viable
market for white shrimp is not yet established in the barangay. Selling of fish catch in the
barangay is largely done through peddling either by other household members of the
fishers or by local wholesalers. White shrimp on the other hand is largely sold to
wholesalers in the city. Overall, the current price situation for the fish catch is satisfactory
with most of the fishers finding the prices to be easy to predict (92.86%), regularly
changing (80.95%), and intermediate (59.52%). As it is, pricing is standardized for the
different species based on size. Regular fluctuation of the prices is linked to the annual
occurrence of algal blooms and typhoons. Meanwhile, intrusions of outsider fish peddlers
coming from Barangays Sucol, Masili and Bay, Laguna into Barangay Bucal are largely
blamed for low prices of fishes according to those few who indicated it. As for the level
of demand for their fish catch, almost all of the artisanal fishers in Barangay Bucal

(92.86%) find that it is high as their supply of fish are almost always sold out.

Characteristics of the institutional arrangement-related factors. Rule dissemination
among the artisanal fishers of Barangay Bucal could be difficult. While majority of the
fishers (90.48%) find the rules easy to understand, most of them (61.90%) however have
only intermediate knowledge of the fishery management rules (Table 4). As regards the
policy choice level, majority of the fishers (78.57%) perceived the decision-making
process as inclusive with many of them citing the meetings of BEARMC/SAMBBU as
the venue where they can participate in policy-making (Appendix C). However, despite
this perceived inclusivity of the decision-making process, a slight majority of the fishers
(52.38%) still feel that violation of the rules should be allowed in some cases particularly
during difficult periods of the year. Consistent with this, a slight majority of the fishers
(52.38%) also perceived that there is a need to change the rules. These last two results
support the previous findings that while the fishers have a channel through which they

can all participate in matching the rules to the local condition of the fishery in the form of

83

BFARMC/SAMBBU meetings, such channel is however not optimally used since
gathering the fishers into these meetings appears to be difficult. As such, this could have
resulted in the observed intermediate rule knowledge of most of the fishers as well as the
potentially mismatched operational rules which most of the fishers want to rectify by

allowing some forms of violations and changes to it.

Rule violation was perceived by majority of the fishers (73.81%) to be low. As
such, these respondents perceived that only less than half of the total artisanal fishers
using the fishery are involved in any form of rule violation. This is supported by the
results shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 indicating that majority of the respondents are
consistently complying with the informal and formal choice rules. On the different forms
of rule violations observed, the use of tibog and the use of electrofishing gears are the
most known to the fishers although the use of fine mesh nets, dredging within the
protected zone, and fishing inside the sanctuary were also cited. Enforcement of the rules
was also seen by almost all of the fishers (97.62%; Appendix A) to be happening

although most (66.67%) perceived selective enforcement. Consistent with the forms of

violations observed, the rules on the use of electrofishing gears, dredge, fine-mesh nets

and tibog were cited as the most unenforced.

‘Compliance to Choice Rules
among Artisanal Fishers

In this study, compliance to the formal choice rules represents cooperative
behavior of the artisanal fishers in the context of their CPR, the coastal fishery. To
indicate the varying degrees of the fishers’ compliance, each were given a CI which is the
sum of the numerical values of their mode of compliance to each of the six formal choice
rules. Considering that never breaking a formal choice rule has a numerical value of
three, occasionally breaking a formal choice rule gets a numerical value of two, and
frequently breaking a formal choice rule gets a numerical value of one, a Cl of 18
signifies that a respondent has never broken any of the formal choice rules and is
therefore consistently compliant. On the other hand, an index below 18 indicates some
configuration of incompliance, while a CI of six would indicate frequent incompliance to
all of the formal choice rules. As it is, those with Cls below 18 are deemed to be

inconsistently complying to the formal choice rules.

With a population CI mean of 17.857, a median of 18 and a skewness of -3.105, it
was found that the distribution of the CI for the informal choice rules, as listed in
‘Appendix B, is highly skewed (Figure 3). This is to be expected as most (88.09%) of the
artisanal fishers of Barangay Bucal are consistent compliers to the informal choice rules,
whereas only very few (i.e. Cl 17, 9.52%; Cl 16, 2.38%) had shown some forms of
incompliance to them (Figure 4). Specifically, of the five identified to have committed
inconsistent compliance to the informal choice rules, three violated the informal choice

rule on the use of electrofishing gears, one on fishing inside the Fish Sanctuary, and

86

another one on the use of fine mesh net. Specifically, of those that violated the rule on the
use of electrofishing gears, two out of the three have committed the violation only

occasionally while the remaining one admitted of frequently doing it.

Based on follow up interviews conducted, those that occasionally use
electrofishing gears revealed that they only do so when it becomes difficult for them to
fish in the open-lake. This, according to them, usually happens during the transition of
the dry and wet seasons when the water level in the lake drops to its lowest. Difficult
periods are known to be critical for rule compliance as shown by previous literature since
severe scarcity or low productivity of resource units during these times lowers discount
rates of the CPR users which can result in a rapid exploitation of the resource (Baland &
Platteau, 1996). On the other hand, the sole violator of the rule against fishing inside the
Fish Sanctuary revealed that his incompliance happened after a strong typhoon washed
off the bamboo poles marking the boundary of the sanctuary. This violation of the rule
due to undefinable sanctuary boundary is consistent with previous literature showing that
cooperation could unlikely be fostered if rules are unclear and ambiguous as users could

not directly appreciate its legitimacy (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

Despite the existence of the informal choice rules in the managemet of the coastal
fishery of Calamba City, it is interesting to note that the artisanal fishers’ rate of
compliance to the formal choice rules remains relatively high. Figure 6 shows that in
terms of the formal choice rules, 54.76% of the respondents have the Cl of 18 while only
23.81% got an index of 16, 19.05% got an index of 17, and only 2.38% got an index of
15. With these indices, the population CI mean of the artisnal fishers is a slightly lower
17.261 while the median is still 18. Although the skewness of the Cl is lower, at - 0.761,
compared to that in the informal choice rules, its asymmetry is still skewed moderately
(Figure 5) which supports the aforementioned observation on the rate of the fishers’

compliance to the formal choice rules.

Pertaining to the formal choice rules, it was found in the same survey that the
most prevalent form of incompliance is the use of tibog which is in violation of DAO
No.3 Series of 1998 (Sec.90) (Appendix B). Of the 19 identified violators of the formal
choice rules, nine or 47.36% are engaged in the frequent use of tibog while seven or
36.84% use it occasionally. Aside from this, the use of electrofishing gears in violation of
DAO No.3 Series of 1998 (Sec.88) also exists as already discussed above. However,
compared to the former, this form of violation of the formal choice rules has much lower
prevalence as only 10.52% and 5.26% of the 19 are occasionally and frequently engaged
in the use of electrofishing gears respectively. Similarly, occasional fishing inside the
Fish Sanctuary which is a violation of City Ordinance 495 Series of 2011 and the use of
fine mesh net which is a violation of DAO No.3 Series of 1998 (Sec.89) also has lower
frequency among the identified violators with only 5.26% being engaged in these

activities respectively.

The prevalence of violation of the formal choice rule through the use of tibog
could be indicative of the heterogeneity of the fishers in terms of their endowments and
the subsequent unwillingness of the tibog users to accept the said regulation as they are
unequally constrained by it (Johnson & Libecap, 1982 as cited in Baland & Platteau,
1996). This possible explanation is supported by the observations of CASD officers
assigned to the open-lake fishery, that in general the artisanal fishers in Calamba City
would agree with introduced conservation rules just as long as they are not the ones being
inhibited by them (Cynthia Buen, personal communication, August 4, 2015).
Furthermore, as there is high number of tibog users in Barangay Bucal, their non-

cooperation could have been agravated by the problem of “diffusion-of-responsibility”,

91

This means that the relatively widespread use of tibog happens as there is lessend
pressure to follow the rule against tibog-use as it does not focus on anyone and the
responsibility is shared among all of the users (Frank, 1988 as cited by Baland &

Plateau, 1996).

‘Among the violators of the formal choice rules, only two committed multiple
forms of incompliance. Specifically, these violations are the occasional fishing inside the
Fish Sanctuary coupled with the frequent use of ribog for one of the violators and the
‘occasional use of tibog coupled with the occasional use of fine mesh net for the other. As

for the rest, only one form of rule incompliance is committed.

Factors and Mode of Compliance to
Formal Choice Rules

Relationship of Socioeconomic Factors and Mode of
Compliance to Formal Choice Rules

Table 7 shows that a strong association exists between the artisanal fishers’ mode
of compliance to the formal choice rules and their age, educational attainment, and
number of household fixtures. These three critical factors are here respectively
dichotomized as: a) whether the fishers are < 50 years of age or older; b) whether they
have finished high school or not; and c) whether the number of their household fixtures
are classified as minimal to low or medium to high. Meanwhile, mode of compliance to
formal choice rules is dichotomized as whether the artisanal fishers are consistenly

complying, in which case their Cl = 18, or inconsistenly complying, with Cl < 18.

Considering that these factors, as explanatory variables in the simple logistic
regression, have positive regression coefficients (Table 11), their associations with the
fishers’ mode of compliance are therefore all “positively” oriented. As such, holding
other factors constant, the odds for a consistent compliance to the formal choice rules (i.¢.
having a CI of 18) was found to be 4.9524 times higher when an artisanal fisher is > 50
yrs. old than when he is < 50 yrs. of age; 6.9333 times higher when he has finished high
school than when he has not; and 9.2727 times higher when he has medium to high
number of household fixtures than when he possesses minimal to low number of

household fixtures.

The result above showing a strong “positive” association between relative wealth
(ie. as represented by the fishers’ number of household fixtures) and mode of compliance
to the formal choice rules lend support to the notion that more economically well-off

resource users are more free to follow resource management rules compared to those who

are very poor. This could be because resource users that are hard-pressed by survival
constraints tend to heavily discount the future benefits of conservationist strategies and
overweigh its present costs due to concerns about sheer survival in the short run. As such,
they are highly likely to credibly precommit to non-cooperation when asked to contribute
in the conservation of the resource they are using. In contrast, richer resource users can
safely adopt a more conservative use of the resource since they believe that with their

level of wealth, the total gain from following the management rules would outwei

total cost (Baland & Platicu, 1996).

Based on the result of the pairwise association showing strong association
between the artisanal fishers’ age and number of household fixtures, as well as the result
of the subsequent simple logistic regression showing higher odds for the acquisition of
medium to high number of household fixtures when the artisanal fishers are > 50 yrs. old
than when they are not (Appendix B), it is conjectured that the strong “positive”
association between consistent compliance to the formal choice rules and the fishers
being > 50 years old could be due to the said group being much wealthier compared to
those that are younger. If this is the case and consistent with what is discussed above,
being more privileged has therefore allowed the > 50 years old artisanal fishers to adopt
more conservative use of the coastal fishery. However, aside from this possible
explanation, old age can also be positively linked to cooperative behaviour as it
influences security values (Shwartz, n.d.). According to Schwartz (n.d.), strength, energy,
cognitive speed, memory and sharpness of the senses decline with age. As such, security
values become more important since capacities to cope with change wane. Therefore, it is

further conjectured that the > 50 years old artisanal fishers in Barangay Bucal have higher

95

odds of complying with the formal choice rules since their heightened security values
underlined by their slowed-down capacities to respond to any shut-down practices
necessitate the safe and predictable environment of a formal rule-dominated coastal

fishery.

The strong “positive” associations between the respondents” status of having been

able to finish high school and their membership in BFARMC/SAMBBU (Appendix B) as

well as their consistent compliance to the formal choice rules indicate that education
could be having a positive effect on their civic participation (Milligan, et. al., 2003) or
civic engagement (Young, ef. al., 2011). According to Young, ef. al. (2011), civic
engagement takes various forms including, but not limited to voting, interest group
membership and activity, volunteering, and being involved in local groups, such as
committees and commissions, churches, or citizens’ coalition and movements. As such,
the social benefits of education which in here take the forms of the fishers’ membership
in BFARMC/SAMBBU and their consistent compliance to the formal choice rules may
have accrued as a result of either their education equipping them with cognitive skills that
enhanced their ability to understand the salient fishery management issues in the
municipal water of Calamba City, or their education increasing their interest and

knowledge of environmental and political issues, their involvement in the political

process, and the effectiveness of their political participation (Milligan, ef. a/., 2003).

Mode of Compliance to Formal Choice Rules

Mode of compliance to the formal choice rules has also been found to be strongly
associated with the fishers’ mode of utilizing their Laguna de Bay catfish catch (Table 8).
Specifically, the odds for an artisanal fisher consistently complying to the formal choice
rules is 6.5385 higher when he is into marketing or selling his caught Laguna de Bay
catfish than his odds for the same when he does not sell the said species (Table 11).
Interestingly, it was also found during the pairwise correlation analysis and its subsequent
simple regression analysis that marketing Laguna de Bay catfish has a strong and

“positive” association with medium to high number of household fixtures (Appendix B).

In this case, artisanal fishers who are compliant are deduced as able to do so for
the additional income from selling Laguna de Bay catfish augments their income from
artisanal fishing. Specifically, their decision to shun the use of tibog, even though it is
allowed by the informal rules, could have been costly in the short term as it can further
decrease the size of their fish catch especially during the months of May to June when the
water level in the fishery is at its lowest. But while Laguna de Bay catfish is one of the
least marketed species and one with the lowest market price owing to its strong ramish
taste, the fact that it is also one of the easiest to catch in the fishery, just next to tilapia,
could mean that the income derived from its marketing could be high enough to support

the conservationist strategy of some of the artisanal fishers.

Relationship of Resource User-related Factors and
Mode of Compliance to Formal Choice Rules

For resource user-related factors, it was found that the number of fishermen’s
association joined by the artisanal fishers is strongly associated with their mode of
compliance to the formal choice rules (Table 9). However, since BFARMC/SAMBBU is
the only fishermen’s association in Barangay Bucal, the above factor has become a
representation on how the artisanal fishers’ perceived their state of membership in the
said association. As such, the odds of an artisanal fisher consistently complying to the
formal choice rules is 9.4500 higher when he considers himself a member of the
BFARMC/SAMBBU as compared to his odds for the same when he no longer sees or

does not see himself to be a part of the association (Table 11).

As discussed above, the strong “po:

ive” associations of both membership in

fishermen’s association and consistent compliance to the formal choice rules with

101

educational attainment are indicative of the enhancing and broadening effect of education
on the artisanal fishers’ civic participation (Young, ef. al., 2011). However, the strong,
association observed between the respondents’ mode of compliance to the formal choice
rules and number of membership in fishermen’s association (Table 9), as well as the
higher odds ratio for consistent compliance when a respondent perceives that he is a
member of BFARMC/SAMBBU (Table 11) could also indicate the positive impact of
group membership on cooperation. In Goette, ef. al. (2006), it was shown that group
membership can have a strong effect on the willingness of members to act unselfishly in
the service of the group in terms of them preferring greater cooperation with fellow group
members and having enhanced willingness to engage in altruistic punishment when
fellow group members are the victim of defection. Thus, if such effect characterizes
BFARMC/SAMBBU, it can be deduced that membership in it has increased the rate of
cooperation among its members as they believe more that other artisanal fishers,
specifically the other members of the group, will also consistently comply with the
formal choice rules, and that freeriders will eventually be punished, also by their fellow

association members (Goette, et. al., 2006).

Relationship of Institutional Arrangement-related Factors and
Mode of Compliance to Formal Choice Rules

As shown in Table 10, none of the institutional arrangement-related factors
included in the study exhibited strong association with the fishers’ mode of compliance to

the formal choice rules. However, the respondents’ perception of the scope of rule-

SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS

Summary and Conclusions

The study provides an assessment of the compliance of the fishers of Barangay
Bucal to the formal choice rules enacted for artisanal fishing in the municipal waters of
Calamba City. It also evaluated the different socioeconomic characteristics of the
artisanal fishers, and the exogenous factors stemming from the said resource users, the
coastal fishery, and the institutional arrangement used in the management of the fishery.
Furthermore, it identified the factors influencing the consistent compliance of the fishers
to the aforesaid choice rules.

The artisanal fishers of Barangay Bucal composed the primary respondents of
the study. Semi-structured and Structured interview schedules were respectively used in
gathering data for the preliminary investigation phase and the formal survey phase.

Based on the result of the survey, it was found that consistent compliance to the
formal choice rules among the artisanal fishers of Barangay Bucal is moderate.
Nevertheless, this indicates that despite the existence of an alternative set of informal
choice rules, a slight majority of the fishers are still able to consistiently comply with the

formal choice rules. As such, this disproves the notion that the formal choice rules, which

105

are directly adopted from RA 8550, are unimplementable in its entirety. The use of tibog
comprises most of the incompliance to the formal choice rules; here, a slightly higher
number of fishers use tibog frequently compared to those who use it only occasionally.
This underscores the vital function of tibog in the use of gillnet which is the most widely
used fishing gear among the Barangay Bucal fishers. In the quantitative analysis that
followed, it was found that consistent compliance to the formal choice rules is
“positively” influenced if a) a fisher has medium to high number of household fixtures, b)
is >50 years old in age, c) has completed highschool, d) is into marketing his Laguna de
Bay catfish catch, and ) is a member of BFARMC/SAMBBU. These factors comprise
what Agrawal called “configuration of local conditions” that tipped decision nodes faced
by the artisanal fishers in favour of the consistent compliance to the formal choice rules.
Consequently, these results support the view that the artisanal fishers’ cooperation in
using the formal choice rules, which could lead to an improvement of the conservation of
the coastal fishery of Calamba City, could be increased a) if artisanal fishers are not

experi

icing survival-constraints that can prevent them from absorbing the cost inherent
in the consistent compliance to the formal choice rules; b) if they have the necessary set
of cognitive skills, interest, and knowledge of the political and ecological issues
surrounding the management of the coastal fishery which would enhance and broaden
their participation in the collective action necessary for it; and c) if they have developed
‘strong moral norms that would allow them to trust that other artisanal fishers would
reciprocate their cooperative behaviour of consistently complying to the formal choice

rules.

106

In order to improve the conservation of the coastal fishery through increased
cooperation among its artisanal fishers in using the formal choice rules, certain changes
to the current institutional arrangement affecting conservation efforts should be

considered.

Firstly, to increase the rate of consistent compliance to the formal choice rules,
the formal institutional arrangement structuring artisanal fishing in the coastal fishery of
Calamba City should be augmented. As of the present, only six formal rules make-up the
said institutional arrangement. Of this number, five are choice rules while one is
classified as boundary rule. Except for the formal choice rule against the use of motorized
push-net, all of the other formal rules have been converted into alternative and less
stringent informal rules or social norms (Appendix B). Based on field observations made
and in line with the work of Cole (n.d.) on the typologies of relationship between formal
rules and “working rules”, it is deduced that such structure of the institutional-
arrangement has resulted in a very limited enforcement of the formal choice rules. Thus,
the artisanal fishers of Barangay Bucal, with respect to their choice of artisanal fishing
mode, could not be expected to include in their calculation of total pay-offs the
sanctioning components of the formal choice rules as long as the informal choice rules
persist. Guided by the findings of this study that medium to high wealth level positively
influences consistent compliance to the formal choice rules, city ordinance/s that are pay-

off rule/s by nature should be enacted by the Calamba City Sanggunian Bayan in addition

107

to the five formal choice rules already existing. These pay-off rules should aim for the
giving of side-payments to incompliant artisanal fishers experiencing severe survival-
constraints in exchange for their consistent compliance to the formal choice rules until
such time they gain a more lucrative secondary employment. To achieve collective
action, the side-payments should be more than the violators’ present income from the

banned fishing methods (Baland & Platteau, 1996).

Thus, it is deduced that the present “absence” of disincentives for non-compliance
to the formal choice rules will be countered by the incentives for consistently following
them as will be realized by the pay-off transfer associated with the suggested pay-off
rules when enacted. RA 8550 provides the necessary constitutional basis for the
enactment of such pay-off rule/s. Specifically, these bases are found in, but not limited to,
DAO No.3 Series of 1998 (Sec. 2; Objective 2), DAO No.3 Series of 1998 (Sec. 16; Rule

16.7) and DAO No.3 Series of 1998 (Sec. 109).

Secondly, revision of the boundary-rules of the program “Training and Capal

ty

Building”, which is one of the recurent projects of Calamba City aimed at strengthening
the management of its coastal fishery, should be undertaken. Based on the result of the
study that higher educational attainment has strong positive associations with
membership in BFARMC/SAMBBU as well as consistent compliance to the formal
choice rules; thus, all of the barangay’s artisanal fishers should be made eligible to
participate in the said project and not only the FARMC leaders. As it is, the project is
spearheaded by the Calamba City Goverment, CFARMC and CENRO. It provides

paralegal trainings as well as trainings on leadership, team building, preparation of

108

project proposals, deputation of Bantay Lawa fishwardens, and parliamentary procedures
to FARMC leaders (CASD, 2014). By allowing the artisanal fishers to participate in it, it
is expected that their cognitive skills as well as their interest and knowledge of the many
political and ecological issues surrounding the management of the fishery will be
increased. By doing so, it is deduced that there will be an enhancement and broadening of
the artisanal fishers’ civic participation in the form of increased preference for
membership in BFARMC/SAMBBU and ultimately more consistent compliance to the

formal choice rules.

But more than remedying the present institutional arrangement to improve
cooperation among the artisanal fishers of Barangay Bucal, it is further recommended
that studies similar to this one should be conducted in the future. Specifically, these
studies should assess the other nine coastal barangays of Calamba City. This must be
done as the artisanal fishers of these other barangays also harvest from the same
municipal water and are therefore exposed and at liberty of exposing other artisanal
fishers to both negative and positive externalities coming from their activities in the said
CPR. Thus, a more sustainable institutional arrangement could be formulated if the
determinants of compliance to the formal choice rules among all groups of artisanal

fishers using the municipal water of Calamba City could be assessed.
