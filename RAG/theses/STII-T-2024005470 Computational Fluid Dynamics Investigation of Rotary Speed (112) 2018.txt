ABSTRACT

The emergence of the Casing While Drilling (CWD) for the simultaneous borehole
drilling and installation of the casing pipe has brought into attention one of its inherent
benefits which is the plastering effect. This effect involves the smearing of the mud cake
and cuttings into the surrounding formation as the rotating casing pipe hits the surface of the
borehole, thus creating an impermeable layer which prevents fluid loss. This warrants further
investigation on parameters that affect the formation of the mud cake as it plays a crucial
role on plastering effect. This study utilizes computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
simulations that implements a Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model using ANSYS CFX-18.2
to observe the effects of the particle size distribution (45 µm to 5000 µm) of the cuttings
produced during casing while drilling together with the rotation speed (0 rpm to 80 rpm) of
the casing pipe. A total of 20 simulations was made having different combinations of particle
sizes and rotation speeds. The formation of the mud cake which is the main material
used during plastering effect is the response that was observed from the contributions of
different particle sizes and rotation speeds together with their interactions. It was found that
the particle size distribution is a significant factor in the formation of the mud cake with a
p-value of 0.048, showing that increasing particle size tends to increase the response. Results
have shown that the 2000 µm particle size produced the highest average mud cake thickness.
On the other hand, rotation speed was not found to be a significant contributor to the
formation of the mud cake with a p-value of 0.134. It was also found that the interaction
between the particle size and rotation speed was not a significant factor in the formation of
the mud cake with a p-value of 0.945. The average mud cake thickness obtained from the simulations and the regression equation showed a spread of values within a ±5% range.

CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

The advancement of research and technology gave birth to new methods of drilling,
one of which is Casing While Drilling or CWD. It is a drilling technique where drilling and
casing the borehole are done simultaneously, thus eliminating several steps necessary to
accomplish conventional drilling methods where drilling pipes are used, and boreholes are

cased after drilling (figure 1.1).

(OMV)

The numerous benefits and advantages of employing Casing While Drilling
techniques over conventional drill pipe methods are already well documented with
numerous studies and literatures on the subject (Grijalva, et al., 2017, Meza, et al., 2017).
One benefit is termed as the “plastering effect”, where drill cuttings ground to finer particles
are smeared or hammered onto the borehole wall by the rotating casing. Plastering effect is
therefore considered as a benefit directly associated with Casing While Drilling which
contributes to wellbore strengthening and reduced fluid loss (Meza et al. 2017, Karimi,
Ghalambor, Montgomery, & Moellendick, 2011, Kabir & Gamwo, 2011, Karimi,
Moellendick, & Holt, 2011).

Several factors were found to be directly associated with the occurrence of plastering
effect. Numerous studies show that a certain range of Particle Size Distributions (PSD)
found of solids suspended in drilling mud plays a vital role in plastering effect (Karimi,
Ghalambor, Montgomery, & Moellendick, 2011). Drilling Rotational Speed was also
mentioned to be a factor in the occurrence of plastering effect on studies made by several
papers (Meza, et al., 2017, Kiran, Salehi, & Karimi, 2014, Karimi, Ghalambor,
Montgomery, & Moellendick, 2011, Karimi, Petrie, Moellendick, & Holt, 2011, Karimi,
Moellendick, & Holt, 2011).

A quantitative study on the effects of rotational speed and PSD can be very complex
because of the interactions between the numerous parameters involved. The past studies
about this specific matter are limited to the range of inputs that the experimental setup
affords which limits the study to what is physically available. This can be solved using
Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) methods by allowing researchers to go beyond the
physical confines of laboratory setups and be able to simulate almost every possible

condition.

1.2 Problem Statement

Numerous studies have already been made on mud rheology, particle size
distribution, and their effects on the formation of filter cake in relation to fluid loss and
plastering effect. The contributions of rotary speed, particle size, and their interactions to
the build-up of the mud cake which is necessary for plastering effect to occur, have not been

studied especially in terms of computational fluid dynamics.

As reported in studies made by Watts et al. and Kiran et. al, the advantages of Casing
While Drilling are well documented however, the mechanism on how CWD and plastering
effect results to a significant reduction in lost circulation and increased wellbore strength
has not been studied comprehensively. These studies were designed to work towards the
establishment of methods on how to get repeatable results, however, it could only be based
on available field tests and was subject to physical limitations of experimental equipment.
To be able to further investigate a wider range of values for the different parameters involved
in CWD and plastering effect, computer simulations using Computational Fluid Dynamics

should provide the necessary flexibility without requiring expensive field tests.


1.3 Objectives

The objectives of this study are to investigate the significance of the particle size and
rotation speed and to describe the relationship between these two parameters to the

formation of the mud cake through the use of a regression model.

1.4 Scope of the Study

This study investigates the formation of the mud cake due to the rotation of the casing

string and the size of the particles or cuttings created during casing while drilling.

The effects of drilling mud filtration with respect to the properties of the porous

media is not considered in this study.

A vertical well model using one casing diameter to hole diameter ratio, one fluid
type, concentric casing pipe rotation, with a fixed amount of solids (cuttings) is used for all

simulations.

1.5 Justification of the study

Review of related literature highlights the absence (gap) of a detailed study of
Plastering effect in Casing While Drilling Operations in relation with rotary speed and

particle size using computational fluid dynamics.

Results of this study can serve as a basis to justify investment in further studies

involving laboratory or field tests.

Being able to confirm the effects of varying rotary speed and particle size during
casing while drilling operations can help maximize the advantages and benefits afforded by
having control over plastering effect especially along problematic zones concerning heavy

fluid losses.

CHAPTER 2

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

2.1 Casing While Drilling (CWD)

The use of the casing pipe instead of the traditional drilling pipe for drilling and
casing the well simultaneously has been considered an industrial revolution in terms of

technological advancement (Grijalva et al. 2017).

The method was developed with the goal of reducing the number of “flat time” such
or non-productive time and other time-consuming drilling activities. CWD involves using
the casing string instead of a drill string using a drillable casing bit or drill shoe (figure 2.1),
which is then left in the hole upon reaching the target depth. This eliminates the need to trip
out of the hole and a separate trip in for the installation of the casing which ultimately saves
companies time and money, especially with offshore rigs (Karimi, Moellendick, & Holt,
2011, Guna, Won, & Tan, 2008).

According to Grijalva et al., Casing While Drilling can be classified according to
type of casing string and type of drilling method used. The first group classifies CWD as
either Rotating Casing string which uses a top drive, and a non-rotating string which uses a
downhole motor (figure 2.2).

Figure 2.2: Casing Drilling Classification according to casing point of view (Grijalva et al.,
2017)

Another way of classifying CWD methods is by the type or method of drilling
process used (figure 2.3). The first group is by use of the rotary method where the casing
string itself is being rotated to drill. The next group is by drill-in method where the casing
string is being displaced by a mud motor. The last group is under the liner drilling method

which can be considered as a precursor to CWD.

2.1.1 Advantages of CWD

The momentum gained by research and development of CWD technology can
primarily be attributed to the inherent advantages and benefits afforded by its use. As listed

and discussed in a paper by Grijalva et al. (2017), the following are found to be advantages

given by using CWD:

° Total drilling times are reduced by minimizing the time spent in connecting
tubular strings and removes the need for tripping the drill string in and out of the
hole.

° Protects the wellbore geometry from consequences of unstable zones and
mitigate total mud losses downhole.

° Reduces risks naturally associated with tripping out the drill string from the

wellbore such as “swabbing effect” since the casing is already set as drilling is being

done.
e CWD are recommended to be used on the following situations (Buntoro et
al., 2008):

o Shallow gas
o Formation unstabilities
o Abnormal pressure zones
o Risk of formation swelling
e Removes the possibility of using remedial tubulars which ultimately reduces

overall costs (Maggi et al., 2006)

Studies also show that during CWD, the plastering or smearing action produces an
impermeable mud cake which contributes to the ability of the formation to resist the inflow
of drilling fluids, therefore, wellbore strengthening. This provides a wider operational mud
weight window through the increase in formation fracture gradient produced by the
strengthened wellbore. (Ezeakacha, Salehi, Ghalambor, & Karimi, 2016, Karimi,
Ghalambor, Montgomery, & Moellendick, 2011, Karimi, Moellendick, & Holt, 2011,
Karimi, Petrie, Moellendick, & Holt, 2011)

2.2 The Plastering or Smearing Effect

During the Casing while drilling process, the suspended solids such as

drilling mud particles and cuttings are forced to adhere to the wellbore well through the

rotation of the casing during drilling, thus the term “smearing effect” (figure 2.4). This effect
also contributes to better wellbore stability and strength. During this process, the fine
particles produced from drilling the formation can plug the pore spaces along weak and
unstable formations. This makes Casing While Drilling methods very uscful in deep water
projects where both control of drilling time and unwanted drilling problems such as lost

circulation is critical (Meza et al., 2017).

Plastering Effect

Figure 2.4: Graphical representation of plastering effect (Weatherford)

In Casing While Drilling, the annulus is smaller due to the larger diameter casing
pipes used, as compared to conventional drill pipes. As the casing rotates, it grinds and
pulverizes the cuttings travelling up the annulus which produces the finer-sized cuttings
produced. These cuttings are then smeared onto the wellbore wall which creates a low
permeability mud cake that significantly if not totally prevent fluid loss especially across

high permeability formations (Karimi et al., 2011).

Watts et al. (2010) considers the effect as either the plastering or smearing of the
drill cuttings onto the wellbore wall or the consequential increase in wellbore hoop stress as
cracks are filled with particles during the CWD process. This in turn increases the effective
fracture gradient. Field data shows that CWD is responsible for stopping fluid loss that are
usually an expected occurrence across formations with natural fractures having an average

radial aperture of 1.0 mm.

As plastering effect is associated with wellbore strengthening, the use of contingency
casing strings could possibly be avoided and that fewer casing strings will be necessary for

mature fields, thus lowering the costs (Watts et al., 2010).

2.3 Plastering effect Parameters

Several parameters that serve as the focus of the study are as follows:

2.3.1 Rotary Speed

A study was made by Askew et al. (2011) on surface hole Casing While Drilling
activities in Gabon, West Africa, highlighting numerous observations made on the field ina
five-year span. The study was aimed to consolidate all the data acquired and be able to come
up with specific adjustments and improvements on the benefits afforded by employing
CWD.

Despite using CWD, there still has been some degree of mud losses observed on 63%
of the 50 wells drilled, 48% of which are total losses. It was also observed that CWD is
associated with low values on flow rates, bit HS] and casing RPM, while annular velocities
exhibited high values.

The study included a summary of the drilling parameters as observed during the five-
year study period where it can be highlighted that the range of rotation speed used was 40

to 90 rev/min as shown in the table 2.1:

Table 2.1: Drilling Parameter ranges by hole size (Askew et al. 2011)

Bit size TFA Bit SPP Flow RPM WOB Torque MW

0.092 277 10.1

12-3/4 0.99 0.008 — 0 to 435 132 to 40 to 90 2 to 18 2.6 to 8.3 to
0.356 520 10.3 10.8

16 0.66 to 0.008 0 to 349 208 to 40 to 80 0 to 35 0.4 to 8.6 to
1.49 0.508 396 10.7 10.1

17-1/2 1.04 to 0.005 — 0 to 200 208 to 40 to 80 2 to 25 0.2 to 8.3 to
1.84 0.046 300 10.1 8.9


Askew et al. observed that the TFA in all CWD bit designs were large (0.99 to 1.84
in) and was coupled with lower flow rates as compared to conventional drilling. therefore
giving low bit HSI which was on the range of 0.003 to 0.508 hp/in’. Stand Pipe Pressure
were consistently low which can be attributed to the large drilling casing used in CWD. The
smaller annular clearance afforded by CWD also enables the use of low flow rates for hole
cleaning to minimize borehole washouts. Low RPM’s in the range of 40 to 90 have been
used to limit equipment fatigue. Both WOB and Drilling Torque are based on recommended
values depending on the equipment used, while the mud used on the wells are basic water-
based mud mixed with bentonite/polymer since total mud losses were anticipated. A study
published by Te Gussinklo, Hepp, Swart, & Wingate in 2010 supports the rpm range of 40
to 80 as it was used to achieve successful CWD application results in a vertical exploration

well located onshore in the Netherlands.

Other relevant studies (Meza et al. 2017, Karimi et al. 2011) reports that drilling mud
thickens as casing revolutions increases and translates into a thicker mud cake due to an
increase in cutting volumes fraction. It is also mentioned that high rotational speeds have
the potential to damage the mud cake and therefore it is advisable to maintain lower speeds
to avoid such event from occurring. Salehi, Aladsani, Shahri, Karimi, & Ezeakacha in 2013
also agrees with this finding as they gave observed using CFD simulations that the pipe
rotation especially above 80 RPMs affected the pressure drop negatively for multipe CWD
pipe diameter ratios and concluded that reducing pipe rotation can enhance the drilling

performance.

The experiment done by Meza et al. (2017) utilized a test station with an artificial
borehole capable of performing both conventional drilling and casing while drilling
methods, with the objective of simulating and investigating mud smearing and plastering
effects. Most of the parameters and specifications were set and chosen to simulate those
commonly used in the field, with the said test operating on pipe rotation set at 46 rpm. The
study concluded having been produced a testing assembly which allows future studies that

take into account various RPM speeds.

2.3.2 Particle Size Distribution (PSD)

Plastering effect is said to involve the casing drilling process itself as a main
mechanism in producing drill cuttings by grinding, producing a large particle size
distribution profile (PSD) as compared to the ones observed in conventional drilling. The
fine sized cuttings are then adhered to the wellbore, creating a high quality, thin, low
permeability mud cake on the wellbore wall. It was also observed that cement forms a good
bond to the mud cake made this way (Karimi et al., 2011). Salehi et al. (2013) also showed
that mud PSD together with the cuttings are crucial to increase the potential of the plastering

effect including that of wellbore strengthening through plugging of wellbore fractures.

On a paper authored by Watts et al. (2010), they studied the Particle Size Distribution
to be able to determine necessary mud additives during CWD operations in the hopes of
getting the plastering effect results in a consistent and repeatable manner. They observed
that in the addition of particles to the mud to achieve a desired PSD, the expected fluid losses
along natural fractures were stopped during CWD in the Piceance Basin of Colorado. The
study concluded that the best results were produced using a wide PSD of LCM between 100
and 2000 microns, but other PSDs may be necessary depending on many factors such as the
mud system, size of drill cuttings produced, and the fracture morphology. As observed, the
authors are led to believe that a wide PSD is not needed to achieve wellbore strengthening
and claims that it may even be less effective in some cases. Karimi et al. (2011) confirms
this observation on a separate study focused on pipe size diameter and its role in plastering
effect during CWD. Watts et al. have concluded that based on previous wellbore

strengthening methods, courser particles for LCM generated optimal results.

Several papers published their observations regarding CWD and the role of
plastering effect in the solution of loss circulation problems. Lopez et al. (2010) in the Cira
Infantas field of Colombia, Dawson et al. (2010) in Angsi field in Malaysia, Gallardo et al.
(2010) in the Cashiriari field in the Peruvian jungle, and Beaumont et al. (2010) in the
Peruvian fields, claim that evidence suggests that the fine cuttings produced during drilling
played a key role in producing the plastering effect and/or that the effect gave the
problematic areas much needed wellbore strengthening to combat fluid losses. Another
paper made by Vos et al. (2013) also reported the benefits of the small cuttings produced by

drilling using CWD, claiming that these cuttings serve as a good coarse LCM. However, no


clear conclusion could be made on the exact mechanics regarding the degree of contribution

to the observed plastering effect.

2.3.3 Annular Clearance

Watts et al. (2010) stated on their paper that annular clearance was apparently a key
factor to the successful utilization of plastering effects in CWD operations and mentioned
that the same observation was at that time still not fully understood. This was based on a
field trial using CWD in the Alaskan Tarn Field where an open hole leak off resistance was
said to have been improved by as much as 3.0 ppg with the use of 7-inch casing. Four wells
were then drilled in the Kaparuk field and another four in the Tam field of North Alaska
based on the success of the field trial. The results show that wellbore strengthening was
significant on the wells using 7 and 7.625-inch casings but not on the wells with 5.5-inch

casings.
The casing to hole diameter ratios of the drilled wells are compared as follows:

Table 2.2: Casing to hole diameter ratio comparison of drilled wells (Watts et al. 2010)

Wells Casing to hole diameter ratio
Piceance 0.86

Tam test well and second Kuparuk 0.80

well
First Kuparuk well 0.77
Third and fourth wells (Tarn) 0.73

With the third and fourth wells having the smallest casing to hole ratio, Leak Off
Tests showed that both wells failed to produce the same level of improvements in terms of
wellbore strength as compared to the other wells with higher casing to hole diameter ratios
despite using the same rotary speeds, mud type, and LCM. Apparently, Wellbore geometry
is seen to be a significant factor in achieving the desired plastering effect. The authors
concluded that using casing to hole diameter ratios below 0.8 produced less results in terms

of wellbore strengthening. Figure 2.5 illustrates the difference between the casing diameter-


to-hole size ratio of conventional drilling methods (left) and casing while drilling methods
(right).

Karimi et al. (2011) also published a paper focused on the contribution of pipe size
to plastering effect during Casing While Drilling. The study confirms that the casing to hole
diameter ratio can be considered a primary factor for the occurrence of plastering effect, and
that the successful application of the plastering effect is observed with ratios in the range of
0.75 to 0.9 as summarized in table 2.3.

2.3.4 Mud Rheology

A research paper published by Kabir & Gamwo on 2011 studied filter cake formation
on a vertical well under high pressure and temperature using computational fluid dynamics
modeling. The objective of the study to help develop solutions to overly high drilling fluid
losses into the formation and help optimize the formation of the mud cake through the

development of simulations.

The research method treated the drilling fluid as a two-phase system consisting of
the solid particles suspended in a non-Newtonian fluid (Power Law fluid properties) with

the following conditions:

e Liquid density: 999 kg/m?
e Consistency (k): 0.1238 Pa:s"

e Power-law index: 0.67

A related research paper by Fisher, Wakeman, Chiu, & Meuric in 2000 used the

same consistency and power-law index values to simulate non-Newtonian muds.

2.3.5 Mud Cake Thickness

Mud cake is formed after the drilling mud enters a porous and permeable formation
with contributions from many other factors. As the drilling mud flows through the rock, the

liquid phase (continuous phase) passes through and the mud additives along with the


suspended solids created by the drill bit or casing bit gets “filtered” out and left on the surface
of the borehole wall. This forms a layer of solid particles hence; the thickness of the formed

filter cake can show how much fluid is lost in the formation.

A recent study (Meza et al. 2017) shows that conventional drilling samples formed
a relatively thicker layer of mud cake on the borehole wall (Figure 2.6) as compared to a
thinner mud cake observed on CWD drilled samples (Figure 2.7). The study also illustrates
the effect of “smearing” as the casing compresses and forces the mud cake into the formation
as it hits the borehole wall, clogging the pore spaces with cutting materials and mud

particles. This in turn forms a low permeability layer that produces the plastering effect.

view, (B) side view. (Meza et al. 2017)

view. (Meza et al. 2017)


Karimi, Petrie, Moellendick, & Holt (2011) also reported in their study that the
casing while drilling methid produces a thin, low-permeability, and low-porosity filter

cake which prevents drilling fluid loss as shown in Figure 2.8.

2.4 Computational Fluid Dynamics

Numerous studies on modelling solid-liquid flow in annular geometries have

achieved accurate results using CFD methods while following their respective objectives.

These studies highlight the advantages of using CFD techniques in the flexibility of the

model in using an almost unlimited range of values to test cases and scenarios.

In the various studies, a 3D model of a pipe, annulus, boundaries, fluids, and solid

particles were simulated with the following general components and governing equations:


. Multiphase flow solution— a multiphase flow with dispersed solid particles is
required to be able to compute and simulate the parameters being studied. Either a
Lagrangian approach where each particle is observed and studied, or a Eulerian
approach where a velocity/property field is used to study a large number of particles
at once, can be taken for CFD solutions. Hence the Inhomogeneous (Eulerian-
Eulerian or two-fluid) model is chosen because it can model the required high solid
volume fractions, solid particle to particle interactions, and turbulence needed for the
study. It is important to note however that complex closure relationships are required
due to this selection. (Ofei 2016, Ofei & Ismail 2016, Ofei, Irawan, & Pao, 2014,
Kabir & Gamwo, 2011)

Continuity Equations — a governing equation is required for the simulation and
solution of computational fluid dynamics for fluid and solid particle mass. The
Navier-Stokes continuity equations, in the solids fractions form, with the assumption
of having an isothermal flow condition for both the solid and fluid phase continuity
equations are used for the simulation. (Ofei 2016, Ofei & Ismail 2016, Ofei, Irawan,
& Pao 2014, Zhu et al. 2013)

. Momentum Equations — forces acting on both solid and liquid phases are modeled
using the Navier-Stokes momentum equations which models the interphase
momentum transfer for the interaction between each phase are needed for the study.
(Ofei 2016, Ofei & Ismail 2016, Ofei, Irawan, & Pao 2014, Zhu et al. 2013)

. Interphase Drag Force Model — the drag force calculations should be modeled using
the Wen and Yu drag coefficient model if the solid volume fraction of densely
distributed solid particles is less than 0.2, and the Gidaspow drag model is used if
the solid volume fraction is greater than 0.2. (Ofei 2016, Ofei & Ismail 2016, Ofei,
Irawan, & Pao 2014)

. Interphase Gravity (Lift Force) Model — the Saffman and Mei lift force model is used

for spherical solid particles (Ofei 2016, Ofei & Ismail 2016, Ofei, Irawan, & Pao,
2014)


6. Turbulence in multiphase flow — Calculations of turbulent flow uses the standard k-
£ model due to its robustness and reasonable accuracy for a wide range of cases. It
was found out however that separation prediction on non-equilibrium boundary
layers are not predicted accurately. The SST turbulence model which is available in
ANSYS-CFX can effectively be used for non-equilibrium turbulent boundary layer
applications. The SST approach used in CFX also enables the use of relatively lower

grid resolutions due to the near-wall treatment of equations (ANSYS, 2004).

The turbulent flow is modeled using the Shear Stress Transport (SST) model
which is found to be accurate and comprehensively applicable for applications
requiring advanced near-wall treatments even for grids with reduced near-wall
spacing. The model is based on transport equation to estimate turbulent length and
velocity scale coming from turbulent energy () and the frequency (w) and has been
studied in many cases. (ANSYS 2004, Bardina, Huang, & Coakley 1997, Menter
1993)

7. CFD Numerical Solution — The required governing equations for the CFD modeling
and simulations were solved using packages included in commercial CFD software.
FLUENT CFD was used by Kabir & Gamwo (2011), and Zhu, Sun, & Tong (2012),
while ANSYS CFD was used by Ofei (2016), Ofei & Ismail (2016), and Ofei,
Irawan, & Pao (2014).

Time discretisation was done using first-order implicit method, while conservation
law equations were solved using second-order implicit methods. Algorithms were
used to solve pressure-velocity coupling for the momentum equations. For the
convective terms, a high resolution discretisation scheme was used. The simulation
used a constant time-step of 0.001 seconds to run for a total time of 20 seconds.
Convergence of the solution was assumed for a root mean square (RMS) of the
normalized residual error of 1.07 (Ofei 2016, Ofei & Ismail 2016, Ofei, Irawan, &
Pao, 2014).

8. Model Geometry - In 2011, Kabir & Gamwo published a paper entitled: “Filter cake
formation in the vertical well at high temperature and high pressure: Computational
fluid dynamics modeling and simulations”. The main objective of the paper was to

optimize the formation of the filter cake to help reduce large losses of drilling mud


into the formation. This was done by simulating the conventional drilling method
using a 2D model under high and moderate temperatures and pressures. The 2D

models used in the study are shown on the following figures:

CHAPTER 3

METHODOLOGY

3.1 Method

ANSYS-CFx 18.2 student version software was utilized for the Computational Fluid
Dynamics of the project. As the model involves the flow of two phases where the solid phase
is suspended in the liquid phase, the inhomogeneous model, also known as the Eulerian-
Eulerian model is employed as available in ANSYS-CFx. The model is known to be able to
handle high solid volume fractions with turbulence calculations and particle to particle
interaction, so it is preferred over the Lagrangian Particle Tracking model as mentioned from

the previous chapter.

The simulation should be able to incorporate the following requirements to generate

the intended results:

e Governing equations
a. continuity equations
b. momentum equations
e Other closure models
a. interphase drag force model
b. lift force model
c. turbulence model
e boundary and initial conditions

e geometry and mesh model

The proceeding sections provides more details regarding these requirements.

3.1.1 Governing Equations

The following governing equations are set with a solid-liquid flow with the
assumption of both isothermal, laminar, and at transient state:


3.1.1.1 Continuity Equations

The Navier-Stokes models for the solid and liquid phases, having transient, constant
temperature, solid-resist, and capacity-medianed conditions, volume-averaged, and where

mass exchange between two phases under combustion reaction are neglected are given:

2 (hg) + V(hgUs) = 0 (3.1)
5g uw) + V(h,U;) = 0 (3.2)
Where:

h, = solid volume fraction

h, = liquid volume fraction

U, = solid velocity vector

U, = liquid velocity vector

3.1.1.2 Momentum Equations

Setting both solid and liquid phases under equilibrium conditions, thus in balance of
momentum or impetus equilibrium, we have the interphase momentum connecting both

phases as shown by the Navier-Stoke Models in the following forms:

psh,[S8+ U, VU] = —h.Vp + h.V-t) ++ — VP; + hspsg + M (3.3)
au; =
pak, |<! + Uy WU;] = —kiVp + kV t+ kipig + M (3.4)

For the shear stress tensors of the solid and the liquid phase, are given respectively:
T= (CB + 5Us)I + ms {IVY + (VU,)"] 2 (V- Us)I} (3.5)

1 = MV, + (VU,)"] -2(V- U,)I (3.6)


Where:

g = acceleration due to gravity

p = thermodynamic pressure

ay = liquid density

Ds = solid density

M = total interfacial force (with drag and lift)

Ts = shear stress tensor for solid phase

Ty = shear stress tensor for liquid phase

Us = shear viscosity of solid phase

My = shear viscosity of liquid phase

Gs = bulk viscosity of solid phase with granular particle resistance

Given that the bulk viscosity of the solid phase takes into consideration the
resistance of the particle grains against compression and expansion we have:

4, (3)
fs = 3 hsPsdpGo(1 +e) = (3.7)

The pressure of the solid phase pressure P, represents the normal force acting

between the solid particles as shown by:

P, = psh,O, + 2h2p;0,(1 +)9o (3.8)

Where p,h,O, represents particle velocity inclusive of fluctuations, and

2h2p,©,(1 + €)go represents the collisions the solid particles experience.

We also have the total shear viscosity of the solid phase 1, coming from both kinetic
and collisional factors shown by:
Us = Usckin) + Us(col) (3.9)

Where:

3.1.2 Interphase Models

3.1.2.1 Drag Force Model

Drag force model for spherical particles:

3Cp

Ma = qp-

k,p,|Us — U,|(Us — U;) (3.12)

It is noted that the Wen and Yu drag coefficient, Cp is used when the volume fraction

(cuttings fraction) k, is less than 0.2.

The following equation is then selected in the ANSYS-CFx Software which takes

into consideration a limiting factor in the inertial regime:

Cy = kz**Smax|—— (1 + 0.15Nj25°”) 0.44 (3.13)
Nrey “
where:
Nrey = kiNrey (3.14)
and
d,
Ney = pulUs ~ Usl = (3.15)

As for the case of high solid volume fraction k, greater than 0.2, the drag model

would then be the Gidaspow drag equation as shown:

- 150(1 — ky)? my + 7 (1 — ky) pilU, — UI (3.16)

M.
a ky d2 4 d,


3.1.2.2 Gravity (Lift Force) Model

Spherical solid particles are subject to gravitational forces thus, the Saffman and Mei

model is chosen to represent the interaction in the ANSYS-CFx as given below:

3 v
= 3 ve Ci hsp,(U, — U,)(V x U, + 20) (3.17)
2nd, J|V x U,|

Where:
Ci = 6.64 if 0 < Nrep < Nre, <1
For different values of Nre,» the following equations are then used:

For Nrep < 40

Ci = 6.46: f (Nee, Nrew ) (3.18)

For 40 < Ne, < 100

Ch = 6.46 - 0.0524 - (BNpe,) (3.19)
Where
Nne, = Cees (3.20)

3.1.2.3 Turbulence Model

The model has coefficients that are a linear combination of the corresponding

coefficients of the model below:

Where:

B’ = 0.09

a2 = 0.44
Bz = 0.0828

Our. = 1/0.856

The proper transport behavior to account for the transport of the turbulent shear stress can

be calculated using a limiter to the eddy-viscosity as shown by the equation below:

a,k

vt * Tax(a,, SF) (3.26)
Where

The term F> is a function that restricts the limiter to the wall boundary and S is a

strain rate invariant measure. We also note that the production in terms of « is given by:

P, = a) Py (3.28)

3.1.3 Mesh Geometry and Model

A three-dimensional model using ANSYS Workbench Design Modeler is created
with concentric vertical circular pipes with the casing having three nozzles at the bottom is

created using to represent a CWD bottom hole environment with the following dimensions:

Table 3.1: Dimensions of the Model Geometry

Model height (borehole) 1000 mm
Casing length 810 mm
Borehole diameter 400 mm
Casing pipe outer diameter 320 mm
Casing shoe (bit) nozzle diameter 40 mm
Casing shoe (bit) nozzle height 50 mm

The following equation is utilized to compute the hydrodynamic entrance length to

make sure that the model will simulate a fully developed flow:
a
L, = 4.4 X Nr x Dn (3.29)

Where:
Lh = length of hydrodynamic entrance
Nee = Reynold’s number

Dn = Hydraulic diameter


The dimensions of the 3D model are illustrated by figures 3.1-4:

Grid cells for the vertical pipe 3D geometry used an unstructured tetrahedral mesh,
with the boundaries of the pipe having inflation layers. The design also allows further
adjustment and refinement of the number of elements until a desired undisturbed outcome
is established based on a grid independence study. This is done using steady state
simulations with 300 timesteps where the average pressure drop is taken for different
numbers of elements. The figures from the grid independence study is presented in table 3.2

and is shown graphically in figure 3.1.

3.1.5 Numerical Solution

The simulation is done using ANSYS CFx Solver working with the Navier-Stokes
models along with all the necessary terms and conditions. Discretization of the mass and
momentum equations are done using the control volume method as previously mentioned,
where the time parameter is discretized using the first-order implicit method, while the space
parameter is discretized using the second-order implicit method for preservation law

conditions.

The approach is simplified for the calculation of the pressure-velocity coupling
involved in momentum equations. On the other hand, the convective terms require a more

detailed approach as high resolution discretization conspire is used.

An adaptive timestep option has been used with a maximum of 3000 timesteps.
Convergence of the solution for all simulations are deemed to be reached upon having a

standardized error with a root mean square of 1.0x10~.

3.2 Design of Experiment

The experiment is based on a multilevel factorial design using two factors, one
having four levels (particle size) and another with five levels (rotation speed). There is a

total of 20 simulations, one for each pair of factors.

The experiment is set having the particle size and rotational speed as the two factors
and the response being optimized is the mud cake thickness. The factors and their respective

levels are shown in table 3.4.

Table 3.4: Experimental factors and level values

B— Rotation Speed

Using the factors and their levels, a design table is generated with randomization

After the simulation runs are completed and results obtained, the average mud cake
thickness for every run will be tabulated as the response and analyzed to determine the
significance of the contribution of the factors and their combinations using the p-values with
a confidence level of 95% and alpha value of 0.05.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Preliminary Results

The mud cake thickness and average equilibrium solids volume fractions are
measured from the results of every combination of particle size and rotation speed with
results shown in tables 4.1-4.20. The thickness is determined using the following equations

(Usher, Krestser, & Scales 2001, Kabir & Gamwo 2011):

An imaginary plane (Figure 4.2) which cuts through the center of the model is made
and lines are created the plane for every 0.1m starting from the bottom of the casing up to
near the outlet to represent data taken at different points along the wellbore. This is done at

both sides of the plane separated by the space taken up by the casing (Figure 4.3).

4.1.1 Mud cake thickness using 5000 microns PSD with varying rotation speeds

Here we use a Particle Size Distribution of 5000 microns in five different runs under
varying rotation speeds of 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 rpm. For figures 4.4, 4.7, 4.10, 4.13, and
4.16, (A) shows the cuttings volume fraction profile for the respective rotation speed
indicated while (B) shows some of the streamlines the fluids and particles follow as the mud
flows from the inlet towards the outlet for the respective rotation speed. We note the
difference in the streamlines as the rotation speed increases from 0 to 80 rpm, where the

rotation of fluids and particles become more pronounced.

Figures 4.5, 4.8, 4.11, 4.14, and 4.17 (left-side as per figure 4.3) and figures 4.6, 4.9,
4.12, 4.15, and 4.18 (right side as per figure 4.3) shows the cuttings volume fraction profile
of the right-side observation. The cuttings volume fraction profiles for both left and right
sides shows a general increase in cuttings volume fraction as we get closer to the borehole

wall, indicating the presence of mud cake.

4.1.2 Mud cake thickness using 2000 microns PSD with varying rotation speeds

Here we use a Particle Size Distribution of 2000 microns in five different runs under
varying rotation speeds of 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 rpm. For figures 4.19, 4.22, 4.25, 4.28, and
4.31, (A) shows the cuttings volume fraction profile for the respective rotation speed
indicated while (B) shows some of the streamlines the fluids and particles follow as the mud
flows from the inlet towards the outlet for the respective rotation speed. We note the
difference in the streamlines as the rotation speed increases from 0 to 80 rpm, where the

rotation of fluids and particles become more pronounced.

Figures 4.20, 4.23, 4.26, 4.29, and 4.32 (left-side as per figure 4.3) and figures 4.21,
4.24, 4.27, 4.30, and 4.33 (right side as per figure 4.3) shows the cuttings volume fraction
profile of the right-side observation. The cuttings volume fraction profiles for both left and
right sides shows a general increase in cuttings volume fraction as we get closer to the

borehole wall, indicating the presence of mud cake.

4.1.3 Mud cake thickness using 1000 microns PSD with varying rotation speeds

Here we use a Particle Size Distribution of 1000 microns in five different runs under
varying rotation speeds of 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 rpm. For figures 4.34, 4.37, 4.40, 4.43, and
4.46, (A) shows the cuttings volume fraction profile for the respective rotation speed
indicated while (B) shows some of the streamlines the fluids and particles follow as the mud
flows from the inlet towards the outlet for the respective rotation speed. We note the
difference in the streamlines as the rotation speed increases from 0 to 80 rpm, where the

rotation of fluids and particles become more pronounced.

Figures 4.35, 4.38, 4.41, 4.44, and 4.47 (left-side as per figure 4.3) and figures 4.36,
4.39, 4.42, 4.45, and 4.48 (right side as per figure 4.3) shows the cuttings volume fraction
profile of the right-side observation. The cuttings volume fraction profiles for both left and
right sides shows a general increase in cuttings volume fraction as we get closer to the

borehole wall, indicating the presence of mud cake.

4.1.4 Mud Cake Thickness Using 45 microns PSD with varying Rotation Speeds

Here we use a Particle Size Distribution of 45 microns in five different runs under
varying rotation speeds of 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 rpm. For figures 4.49, 4.52, 4.55, 4.58, and
4.61, (A) shows the cuttings volume fraction profile for the respective rotation speed
indicated while (B) shows some of the streamlines the fluids and particles follow as the mud
flows from the inlet towards the outlet for the respective rotation speed. We note the
difference in the streamlines as the rotation speed increases from 0 to 80 rpm, where the

rotation of fluids and particles become more pronounced.

Figures 4.50, 4.53, 4.56, 4.59, and 4.62 (left-side as per figure 4.3) and figures 4.51,
4.54, 4.57, 4.60, and 4.63 (right side as per figure 4.3) shows the cuttings volume fraction
profile of the right-side observation. The cuttings volume fraction profiles for both left and
right sides shows a general increase in cuttings volume fraction as we get closer to the

borehole wall, indicating the presence of mud cake.

4.2 Results Summary and Discussion

The responses for each of the interactions between particle size and rotation speed
are presented in the table below:

Results show that the combination of 2000 um PSD and 40 rpm produced the highest
mud cake thickness and the lowest was with the 45 um PSD and 60 rpm. We can also see
that most of the results with the highest mud cake thickness came from the 2000 um PSD.

Figure 4.64 further illustrates the summary of the results obtained from all the
simulations:

Figure 4.65: Average Mud Cake Thickness per Particle Size

Figure 4.64 shows that the mud cake thickness generally increases as the particle
size increases, as shown by the responses going from the 45 um to 2000 um. This trend
however decreases as the particle size further increases to 5000 pm as highlighted by figure
4.65.

Figure 4.66: Average mud cake thickness per rotation speed

The effects of rotation speed to the mud cake thickness show a general downward

trend as the rotation speed increases from 0 rpm to 80 rpm as shown in figure 6.66.

4.3 Statistical Analysis

A basic statistical analysis of the results is done using the Minitab 18 software with
the goal of identifying effects that have a statistically significant influence on the response

variable, which in this case is mud thickness.

Using an alpha value of 0.05 and a confidence level of 95%, in the analysis of factors

we have:
If p-value < 0.05 (significant)
p-value > 0.05 (insignificant)

Table 4.22: P-Values of the factors and their interactions

PSD-RPM interaction


We can see from table 4.22 that particle size has the most significant influence in the
formation of the mud cake, followed by the rotation speed and the interaction between the
two factors, with the particle size being the only significant factor in the formation of the
mud cake.

Figure 4.68: Standardized effect of the PSD and RPM interaction

With the alpha value set at 0.05 and confidence level at 95%, only the particle size
distribution factor was able to exceed the standardized effect (influence/contribution)
threshold, with the PSD and RPM interaction showing very low levels of significance as
shown by figures 4.67 and 4.68.


This means that the interaction between the particle size and rotation speed does not

significantly to the formation of the mud cake.

A regression equation as a model of the mud cake thickness in terms of particle size

and rotation speed is generated:

ThicknesSymc = 16.1015 — 0.256A — 0.209B + 0.493C — 0.028D + 0.274E + 0.029F +

0.291G — 0.363H — 0.2311 (3.35)
Where:

A = 45m PSD F =20 RPM

B = 1000um PSD G = 40 RPM

Cc = 2000um PSD H = 60 RPM

D = 5000nm PSD I = 80 RPM

E =0 RPM

Table 4.23 Specific factors and their corresponding regression coefficients

Factor Coefficient
2000 um 0.493
40 rpm 0.291

0 rpm 0.274
20 rpm 0.029
5000 um -0.028
1000 tm -0.209
80 rpm -0.231
45 um -0.256
60 rpm -0.363

From table 4.23 we can see that the factor that has the most significant contribution
is the particle size of 2000 um followed by the 40-rpm rotation speed. When combined,
these two makes up the greatest mud cake thickness recorded as previously shown in table
4.21. We can also see that the 60-rpm setting gives the least contribution to mud cake

thickness followed by the 45 um. When combined, these two form the lowest recorded mud
cake thickness.


We also notice the negative values starting from the 5000 pm particle size, denoting
an inversely proportional predicted contribution. This means that the increase in particle size
from 2000 jm is not expected to increase mud cake thickness but decrease it instead. This

supports the initial observations made from the data.

We do note however that the interactions between the particle size and rotation speed
or its different combinations does not show any observable trends, hence its significance on

the mud cake formation was found to be low.

Figure 4.69 shows a plot of all the values calculated from the simulations and those
that are obtained using the regression equation. It can be observed from the scatter plot that

the values obtained from both methods fall within a range of +5%.


CHAPTER 5

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1 Conclusions

In lieu of the first objective, a parametric study was done and produced results that
show that the particle size is the most significant factor in the formation of the mud cake
with a p-value of 0.043. Data shows that average mud thickness across all rotation speeds
tends increase as the particle size increases to 2000 microns, then tapers down when the
particle size is set at 5000 microns. The increase of mud cake thickness observed with the
increase of particle size to 2000 microns agree with the results of related literature (Watts et
al, 2010, Kabir and Gamwo 2011). On the other hand, the observed decrease in mud cake
thickness as the particle size is further increased to 5000 may reflect the drag and lift forces
that were modeled in the simulations, where particles larger than 2000 microns could easily
be blown away by the flowing mud. We do note however that the exact mechanics behind

this observation may require further investigation as reported by Vos et al (2013).

Also in lieu of the first objective, results of the parametric study show that the
rotation speed is not a significant factor in the formation of the mud cake with a p-value of
0.134. We note that the results show a general decreasing trend in the mud thickness as the
rotation speed increases from 0 to 80 rpm. This observation agrees with Ofei et al. (2014)
where a non-Newtonian carrier fluid is subjected to an increase in rotation speed, the cuttings
volume fraction decreases as the rotation effect sweeps the cuttings into the annular
mainstream and transports them to the surface (outlet). This observation also reflects the
observations Meza et al. (2017) and Karimi et al. (2011) made in their papers that high
rotational speeds have the potential to damage the mud cake and advices to maintain lower

speeds (<80 rpm) to avoid such event from happening.

In lieu of the second objective, a regression model was formulated and suggests that
the interaction between the particle size and rotation speed does not contribute any
significant (p-value of 0.945) additional effects on the mud cake formation. It can be
concluded that the contributions of both parameters to the mud cake formation are

Statistically independent of each other.


5.2 Recommendations

Based on the results and the scope and limitations of this study, several
recommendations are made for future undertakings regarding the formation of the mud cake

for plastering effect in casing while drilling operations.

The effects of the porous media on the formation of the formation of the mud cake
should be considered. The formation of a filter cake due to the filtration effects across a
porous medium is well documented and should therefore be included as a parameter to be

studied.

Other configurations and settings in the modeling and simulation phases should be
considered such as eccentered wells with orbital rotation, non-vertical well geometry,
different drilling fluid types, and factor in the effects of the rotation speed to the number of
cuttings generated or the rate of penetration. This is to better simulate the actual drilling
scenario and produce more detailed results with the interactions and significance of multiple

factors in plastering effect.
