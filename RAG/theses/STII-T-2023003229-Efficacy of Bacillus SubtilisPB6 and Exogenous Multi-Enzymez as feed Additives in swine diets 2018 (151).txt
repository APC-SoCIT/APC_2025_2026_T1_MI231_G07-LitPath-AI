ABSTRACT

FLORES, ROY MIGUEL DANILA. University of the Philippines Los Bafios. June
2018. Efficacy of Bacillus subtilis PB6 and Exogenous Multi-enzymes as Feed

Additives in Swine Diets.
Major Professor: Dr. ROMMEL C. SULABO

Two studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Bacillus subtilis PB6
(CLOSTAT, Kemin Industries Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., Singapore) and exogenous multi-
enzymes (Kemzyme MAP, Kemin Industries Asia Pacific Pte.Ltd.. Singapore) as feed
additives in swine diets. The first study determined the interactive effects of
supplementing Bacillus subtilis PB6 in diets with and without in-feed antibiotics or zinc
oxide on growth performance and diarrhea incidence. The second study determined the
effect of exogenous multi-enzyme supplementation on growth performance. caloric
efficiency, carcass characteristics and diet economics in growing-finishing pigs. Results
of the first study indicate that Bacillus subtilis PB6 supplementation at 0.05% in nursery
pig diets did not affect growth performance but reduced (P<0.02) diarrhea occurrence.
For the second study, MAP supplementation did not affect growth performance and
caloric efficiency, but increasing dose of MAP in grower finisher pig diets improved
(quadratic, P=0.04) loin eye area and tended (quadratic, P<0.08) to improve carcass
leanness. In Conclusion, supplementation of Bacillus subtilis PB6 does not have an effect
in growth performance but does have an effect in reducing diarrhea incidence while

supplementation of MAP does have quadratic effect in terms of LEA

INTRODUCTION

Managing the gut microbiota to improve intestinal health is an important factor in
swine nutrition to achieve optimal performance from weaning to harvest (Pluske, 2013).
It plays a vital role in supporting health and preventing diseases such as diarrhea, which
is one of the major problems during the post-weaning period. As a result, a variety of
antibiotics are commonly used in nursery pig diets for prophylaxis and growth
promotion. However, increasing concer regarding the potential link between use of
antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) and development of antimicrobial resistance in

humans had led to intensified research for safe but effective alternatives (Pluske, 2013).

Various strains of bacteria are used as feed additives to promote competitive
exclusion, Weanling pigs do not have an established microbiota in the gut so adding live
bacteria to the diet increases the population of good bacteria in the small intestine, which
competes with disease-causing bacteria that colonize the gut. A unique strain of Bacillus
subtilis, PB6, isolated from the intestinal tract of healthy chickens has been shown to be
an effective alternative to antibiotics in poultry, especially in birds with Clostridium
perfringens challenge (Abudabos et al., 2013). Recently, it was proposed to be used as a
probiotic in swine diets. However, there is very limited research regarding its efficacy
particularly in nursery pig diets. In addition, the effect of supplementing B. subtilis PB6

in diets containing antibiotics or zinc oxide, which is a chemotherapeutic agent used as

a
an anti-diartheal agent and an altemative to AGP in nursery pigs is also not known.
Therefore, research is needed to evaluate B. subtilis PB6 as an AGP replacement in

nursery pig diets.

The amount of indigestible fractions of carbohydrates and proteins in swine diets
not only reduces the nutritional value of feeds but also affects the gut microbiota. and
consequently intestinal health and production performance. Dietary fiber is composed of
different classes of non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs), which act as anti-nutritional
factors due to its negative effects on nutrient digestibility, particularly on energy. protein
and fats (Lindberg, 2014; de Lange et al., 2000). Supplementing swine diets with
enzymes to help digest and break down NSPs into simpler forms may enable the pig to
utilize the nutrients for growth (Bedford and Patridge, 2010). Since enzyme activity is
dependent on the nature of NSP present in the diet, it is important to determine the kind
of NSP used in the diet to choose the appropriate enzymes which can degrade it
(Willamil et al., 2015).Recently, a multi-substrate enzyme product containing NSP
enzymes, multi-proteases and multi-amylases, was introduced commercially to the feed
industry that was developed to improve the digestibility of dietary fiber, protein and
starch, which may have greater effects in improving the nutritional value of swine diets.
However, there is limited research on the effectiveness of this multi-enzyme when used

in high-fiber swine diets; hence, this study.

Objectives of the Study

The general objective of the research was to evaluate the effectiveness of Bacillus
subtilis PB6 (CLOSTAT, Kemin Industries Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., Singapore) and

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

Introduction

Feed represents about 60 to 80% of the total cost of pork production in modem
capital-intensive systems. Energy content of feeds may solely represent 50% or more of
the total cost of pork production (Gutierrez and Patience, 2012).Carbon-containing
compounds of feed include fat, carbohydrate and protein, which release energy when
oxidized. Such energy is required for biosynthesis of proteins, bones and lipids, for
biochemical processes associated with maintenance, for active ion transport. and for
mechanical work (Patience, 2012).Generally, immature pigs will typically attempt to
consume sufficient feed to meet their energy requirement for maintenance and growth.
Yet, there are situations where feed intake is impaired by social, physiological, or
environmental constraints.

Weaning under modem-day. commercial conditions inflict stress (i.e.
environmental, nutritional, and social) on pigs. Stress may result into marked changes in
the pig's gastrointestinal tract (GIT) physiology, microbiology and immunology
(Gutierrez and Patience, 2012; Patience, 2012). Consequently, the period following
weaning is generally characterized by sub-optimal growth, deteriorated feed efficiency,
and a high incidence of intestinal disturbances with diarrhea (bacterial and/or dietary
origin), which may cause morbidity and/or mortality.In order to overcome this post-
weaning growth check, some of the agents employed are antibiotics and (or) mineral

compounds (such as ZnO) to diets for weanling pigs.

6

However, the possible contribution of in-feed antibiotics to the development of
antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria led to the ban of antibiotic use in livestock and
poultry feed.For example, the European Union implemented a full ban on in-feed
antibiotics usage in livestock diets in January 2006.

In order to improve the productivity, health and welfare of pigs in the post-
weaning period, it is necessary to find combinations of feed ingredients. It may constitute
combination of feeds with feed additives acceptable for use. The evaluation of feed
additives effective in ameliorating the post-weaning growth check and reducing the
incidence and severity of digestive problems frequently encountered is warranted

(Pluske, 2013).

Gut Health and Antibiotic Resistance

‘A main problem in the early stages of pig production is the vulnerability of
nursing and weanling piglets to gut dysfunction, including diarrhea due to enteric
disorders. Among the causes of enteritis in nursery and weaning is the immature
gastrointestinal tract in young pigs and the shift from a liquid-based to solid-based diet in
the weaning period.

The most common solution has been the use of antibiotics, which eliminate the
microorganisms that cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract, preventing diarrhea in
piglets and newly-weaned pigs. However, this practice no longer adheres to the current

standards set by research institutions. The risk of transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria

7
from livestock to humans through consumption has made the use of antibiotics precarious
for farm operations and food production.

These circumstances show how important it is to find an alternative means of
maintaining the gut health of livestock without the use of antibiotic growth promoters

such as the use of feed additives.

Dietary Fibers on Gut Health

The carbohydrate fraction can be divided according to glycosidic linkages into
sugars, oligosaccharides and two broad classes of polysaccharides; Classes of
polysaccharides are starch and non-starch polysaccharides. Non-starch polysaccharides
together with lignin have been defined as the dietary fiber fraction in feedstuffs and food,
and can be used as a collective measure of their fiber content (Trowel, 1972; Theander et
al., 1994; Bach Knudsen, 1997).

Fiber utilization depends on the age and breed of swine animals. Adult pigs have
a more developed and larger Gl tract, lower feed intake per kg BW, slower digestive
transit time and higher cellulolytic activity than young pigs. These traits resulted into
greater capacity of sows to digest fibrous components compared to young pigs.
Moreover, it was shown that sows digest a larger part of the NSP in the small intestine
than growing pigs (Lindberg et al., 2014).

Endogenous digestive enzymes have not digested dietary fiber components, which
constitute the main substrates for bacterial fermentation in the distal part of the gut. The

main products of fermentation are short chain organic acids (OA), predominantly lactate,

8
acetate, propionate and butyrate. The OA have been suggested to develop the growth of
the digestive tract, by stimulating epithelium cell proliferation. In an acidic environment,
OA can inhibit the growth of enteric bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella, E. coli and
Clostridium species (Lindberg et al., 2014).

Inclusion of soluble NSP in the diet can stimulate the growth of commensal gut
microbes, which leads to increased production of OA and lower pH in the large intestine.
Insoluble NSP reduces the transit time, provides substrate that is slowly degradable by
the microbiota in the distal large intestine, and modulates gut morphology by increasing

villus length (McDonald et al., 1999).

Selected Types of Feed Additives Organic Acids

As Kiarie et al. (2016) referred to a research by the NRC (2012), “Acid products
used in swine diets can be classified as organic acids and their sodium, potassium, or
calcium salts; inorganic acids; and blends of acids and salts.” In some cases, the acid is
coated with lipid or other materials to prevent the acid from affecting the upper part of
the digestive tract. Acid salts are usually odorless and are suitable for feed manufacturing
due to their solid and stable form. They are also less corrosive and more water-soluble
than free acids, though both can be used as food preservatives.

Organic acid is added to feeds to maintain gastric pH and allow the proliferation
of good bacteria in the gut. Gastric acidification in suckling pigs is mainly due to the
presence of lactic acid, resulting from bacterial fermentation of lactose (Kiarie et al.,

2016). Furthermore, a study by Lallés et al. (2007) found that piglets not only lose

9
lactose-induced acidity at weaning, but “the ensuing anorexia worsens the ability of the
physiologically immature gut to produce enough HCI to keep stomach pH at an optimum
of 3.5.” A low gastric pH must be maintained to properly digest proteins and maximize
the populations of beneficial bacteria in the gut, inhibiting the harmful bacteria (Pluske et

al., 2002).

Trace Minerals (Zinc and Copper)

‘According to NRC (2012), zine (Zn) and copper (Cu) are key components in the
pig's biological processes and have vital roles in crucial metabolic reactions and the
production of many enzymes and molecules at the cellular level. There is ample evidence
that pharmacological concentrations of >1000 ppm for Zn and 100-250 ppm for Cu
increases growth in post-weaned pigs (NRC, 2012). ZnO also promotes feed intake by
stimulating the secretion of the hunger hormone ghrelin (Yin et al., 2009), improves gut
microbial ecology (Pieper et al., 2012; Starke et al., 2013), and decreases diarrhea in the
disease challenge model (Owusu-Asiedu et al., 2003; Kiarie et al., 2008). In addition,
high levels of dietary ZnO has specific effects on the colonic morphology, mucin
composition, and expression of genes related to innate immunity and inflammatory
processes in piglets (Liu et al., 2014). These exhibit the importance and some beneficial

effects of adding zinc and copper to swine diets.

Probiotics

Probiotics are live microorganisms that are supplemented in the diet of the
animals to provide intestinal balance in the gastrointestinal tract (Fuller, 1992) and can be
divided into three categories: Bacillus (Gram-positive spore forming bacteria), lactic
acid-producing bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus), and yeast
(Roselli et al., 2005; Stein and Kil, 2006; NRC, 2012). Today, animal industries
intentionally add probiotics such as Bacillus sp., lactic acid strains, and yeast in the diet
to establish the gut microflora of chicken and pigs. One of the most widely-used probiotic
today is Bacillus subtilis which is a spore bearing bacteria that can withstand different
changes in the environment and can be stored efficiently during ambient temperature

(Sindhu and Khetarpaul, 2003).

Function of Probiotics

1) Competes for nutrients in GIT
The gastrointestinal tract contains large amounts of nutrients coming from the
digested food materials. These nutrients are utilized by different kinds of
microorganisms to colonize the gut. Probiotics may compete in terms of the nutrients

and absorption sites with different pathogenic microbes (Malago and Koninkx, 2011).

2)

Competes for binding sites
Adding probiotics to the feed increases the normal microflora colonization via

competitive exclusion, in which probiotic microorganisms attach to the intestinal

W
epithelial surfaces preventing the growth of pathogens such as E. coli (Cho et al.,

2011; Stein and Kil, 2006).

3) Stimulates the immune system
Probiotics stimulate the immune system by inducing the anti-inflammatory cytokines
and reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the enterocytes and intestinal immune
cells recruited to the sites of inflammation by probiotics (Wang et al., 2009). It is
difficult to conclude if the role of probiotics in the immune system stimulation is
significant since probiotics do not eradicate the pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract

(Cho et al., 2011).

4) Produces antimicrobials

Probiotics produce different antimicrobials, antioxidants, and bacteriocins (Reid,
2001).These substances affect the propagation of pathogenic microorganism by
permeating the outer membrane of the gram-positive bacteria and inducing the
inactivation of gram negative bacteria by stimulating antimicrobials factors such as
low ambient temperature, organic acids, and detergents (Alakomi et al., 2000). With

these functions probiotics can reduce viable pathogenic microbes that produce toxins.

Bacillus subtilis PB6 as Probiotics

Bacillus subtilis is a spore forming bacteria that can withstand heat up 100°C for

several minutes, survive 0.5% bile salts, and continue to germinate in vegetative cells

12
(Teo et al., 2006). B. subtilis PB6 is a unique strain isolated from the intestines of healthy

chickens and initially tested in broiler chickens as a probiotic (Teo et al.. 2006).

Effects of Bacillus subtilis PB6 in Broilers

Jayaraman et al. (2013) observed that supplementation of Bacillus subtilis PB6 in
chickens can improveF/G, reduce intestinal C. perfringens counts, and increase the villi
length to crypt depth ratio by 49.11%, and can prevent necrotic enteritis. In addition. a
study conducted by Teo and Tan (2006) in which broilers, infected or uninfected with a
pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli supplemented by B. subtilis PB6 showed
improvements in growth rate and F/G. The study also reported that B. subtilis PB6 not
only helped in the maintenance of beneficial bacteria but also could act as a replacement

for antimicrobial growth promoters in broilers.

Effects of Bacillus subtilis PB6 in Swine

Growth performance. Unlike in poultry. there is currently limited research on the
use of B. subtilis PB6 in swine. Rychen et al. (2017) found that adding B. subtilis PB6 to
the diets of sows at a dose of | « 10° CFU/kg of complete feed can improve the growth of
piglets from birth to weaning. Che et al. (2016) and Hu et al. (2017) also investigated the
effects of adding B. subtilisPB6 supplementation to piglet diets, and observed

improvements in growth performance, intestinal development, and immune function.

13

Diarrhea incidence. A study by Alexopoulos et al. (2004) found that using
Bacillus subtilis decreases the diarthea scores of nursery pigs. In addition to this, Taras et
al. (2005) observed that using B. subrilis decreased the diarrhea occurrence by 59%.
However, there is not enough evidence to support that B. subtilis PB6 strain can minimize
or prevent diarthea incidence in pigs; thus, further research must be done in this area of

inquiry.

Exogenous enzymes. Enzymes are now common in the feed industry and are
used as additives to increase the digestibility and absorption of nutrients which contribute
to increasing the production performance of the pigs. It acts as a biological catalyst for
systematic complex reaction to occur. This reaction includes the conversion of nutrients
into more simpler and absorbable forms. The rationale for developing and applying feed
enzymes is largely based on the premise that even in the best situations, pigs are not able
to utilize 100% of dietary nutrients (Kiare et al., 2016). However there are inconsistencies

in the results of some studies whether enzymes improve the growth performance of pigs.

Carbohydrases. Many biological origins produce a group of enzymes that
catalyze the hydrolysis and synthesis of glycosides, oligosaccharides, and
polysaccharides. This group of enzymes are termed as carbohydrase or glycosidase.
Carbohydrases converts starches into more simple sugars. In animal nutrition, non-starch
polysaccharides or starch is the primary substrate of carbohydrases (Bedford and
Partridge, 2010).

Majority of these enzymes are endo acting enzymes which cut the middle of the

polymer chain, reducing viscosity (Bedford and Patridge, 2001). The use of carbohydrase

14
enzymes in swine diets has mainly focused on eliminating the anti-nutritional effects
associated with the NSP components of feed. Indeed, several studies have shown that
with appropriate enzyme preparations, these anti-nutritional effects can be minimized.
Moreover, it may produce a potential improvement in the nutritional value of feedstuff
for young pigs (Simons et al., 1990; Li et al., 1996; Omogbenigun et al., 2004),
Acombination of different enzyme activities may also be required for degradation of

complex NSP to improve nutrient utilization (Meng et al., 2005).

Starch Degrading Enzymes

Amylase. Amylase breaks down grains into product and vegetable proteins. In
addition, it also allows the use of less cooked grain which can reduce feed cost without
any effect on the pig growth performance (Bedford and Patridge. 2001). Amylases can
be divided into endoamylases and exoamylases. The endoamylases catalyze hydrolysis in
a random manner within the starch molecule. This action causes the formation of linear
and branched oligosaccharides of various chain lengths. The exoamylases hydrolyze the
substrate from the nonreducing end, resulting in successively shorter end products (Gupta

et al., 2003).

Fiber Degrading Enzymes

Cellulase. Cellulase (Figure 1) or cell wall degrading enzymes are used to target
cell wall NSP in pig and poultry diets. They improve nutrient use in pigs fed with wheat

distiller dried grains and solubles (DDGS) based diets (Emiola et al., 2009) and increased

15
cell wall depolymerization in flax and canola seed (Meng et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2006).
Mechanistically, cellulase is a family of at least 3 groups of enzymes (Percival Zhang et
al., 2006; Kuhad et al., 1997; Himmel et al., 1999; Deswal et al., 2011), endo-(1,4)-B-D-
glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) exo-(1,4)-B-D-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.91), and B-glucosidases (EC
3.2.1.21). The exoglucanase (CBH) acts on the ends of the cellulose chain and releases B-
cellobiose as the end product; endoglucanase (EG) randomly attacks the internal O-
glycosidic bonds, resulting in glucan chains of different lengths; and the B-glycosidases
act specifically on the B-cellobiose disaccharides and produce glucose (Singh. 1999;
Bayer et al. 1994). Although the mechanism of cellulose degradation by aerobic bacteria
is similar to that of aerobic fungi, it is clear that anaerobic bacteria operate on a different
system (Percival Zhang et al., 2006; Carvallo. 2003). Cellulosomes located on the cell
surface mediate adherence of anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria to the substrate, which
thereafter undergo a supramolecular reorganization, so that the cellulosomal subunits

redistribute to interact with the different target substrates (Bayer et al., 2004).

Glucose

Xylanases. Xylanase are produced by free living and gut microorganisms and

have also been found in algae, protozoa, snails, crustaceans, and seeds of terrestrial plants
(Woodward, 1984; Sunna and Antranikian, 1997; Domez et al., 2009). They cleave the
xylan backbone randomly resulting to non-substituted or branched xylooligossacharides

(Collins et al., 2005; Polizeli et al., 2005).

Beta glucanases. Beta-glucans, which are present in the endosperm wall of
barley, are composed of glucose molecules in long linear polymers with mixed B-(I+4)
and B-(1+3) glycosidic bonds and have been identified as anti-nutritional factor causing
poor growth and nutrient digestibility in pigs (Kong and Adeola, 2012). Bacterial B-1.3—
1 4-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.73; lichenase) are members of the glycosyl hydrolase family 16
(GH16), and specifically cleave the B-1,4-glycosidic linkage adjacent to 3-O-substituted
glucopyranose residues. The enzymatic depolymerisation of B-glucan releases mainly tri-
and tetrasaccharides, and the enzyme has no detectable effect on B-1,4-d-glucan,
carboxymethylcellulose or on B-1,3-d-glucans (laminaran) (Mccleary et al., 1988). B-1,3—
1,4-Glucanases have potential in several industrial applications. Exogenous B-1,3-1,4-
glucanases have been used to reduce the viscosity of complex barley B-glucans during the
mashing process in the brewing industry and can also improve the B-glucan digestibility
in poultry and swine feed stuffs (Celesto et al., 2006; Li et al., 1996). B-Glucans are
abundant cell wall constituents of sugarcane (Carpita et al., 1996), and the inclusion of B-
1,3-1,4-glucanases in hydrolase cocktails has been proposed to improve the release of
fermentable sugars from lignocellulosic feedstocks in biofuel production (Pauly et al.,

2008).

7

Proteases. Proteases are protein-processing chemicals that are utilized as a part

of pig and poultry sustenance in breaking down storage proteins in different plant
materials and proteinaceous anti-nutrients supplements in vegetable proteins. Seeds,
especially of leguminous plants, for example, soy, contain high convergences of storage
proteins. Storage proteins are proteins created fundamentally amid seed generation and
put away in the seed to give a nitrogen source to the creating incipient organism amid
germination. Storage proteins can tie to starch. Proteases can help separate stockpiling
proteins, discharging bound vitality rich starch that would then be able to be processed by

the creature (Bedford and Partridge, 2010).

Phytases. Phosphorus is vital for bone advancement and metabolic procedures in
pigs and poultry. The majority of the P in plant-derived ingredients is bound to phytate,
which is the fundamental storage of P in plant seeds. In the plant, phytate forms complex.
with minerals, (e.g, P and Ca). proteins and starch, making them inaccessible for
ingestion. Pigs and poultry do not endogenously produce phytase, which is the catalyst
that separates P from phytate. Therefore, supplementing the feed with phytase discharges
phytate-bound minerals,proteins and starch, which would then be able to be processed
and consumed by the animal to enhance the proficiency of meat and egg production.
Phytases likewise diminish the danger of contamination of waterways from abundance of

P discharged by pigs and poultry (Bedford and Partridge, 2010).

Multi Amylases and Proteases (MAP)

Recently, a multi-substrate enzyme product containing NSP enzymes, multi-
proteases and multi-amylases, was introduced commercially to the feed industry that was
developed to improve the digestibility of dietary fiber, protein and starch, which may
have greater effects in improving the nutritional value of swine and poultry diets

(Sugumar et al., 2013).

Multi Amylase and Protease (MAP) in Poultry

Vasanthakumari et al. (2012) reported that the use of alternative raw materials
negatively affect apparent metabolizable energy (AME); however, the reduction was
balanced by supplementing a multi-substrate multi-compound enzyme. Kocher et al.
(2003) also reported comparative change in AMEn when a blend of pectinase, protease
and amylase was added to a corn/soybean basal eating regimen with lower energy and
protein levels.Sugumar and Bindhu (2013) proposedthat absorbability of NSPs, starch
and proteins may be improved by using an ideal blend of NSPases, multi-amylases, and
multi-proteases by (1) solubilization of cell wall NSPs for greater hindgut fermentation
and enhanced usage of energy, (2) increase protein digestibility by increasing protease
activity all through the GI tract and (3) hydrolysis of various amylolytic linkages in starch
which may further increase energy digestibility and (4) removal of anti-nutritional effects

of indigestible fractions, including NSP, by enzymatic hydrolysis.

Multi Amylase and Protease (MAP) in Swine

Sugumar et al. (2013) suggested that the addition of MAP to low energy and low-
protein swine diets may increase accessibility of energy and protein from the feed by the
activity of various enzymes, resulting to greater improvements in nutrient digestibility
and better performance. In comparison to poultry studies, effects of MAP in swine is very

limited.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study 1. Interactive Effects of Bacillus subtilis PB6 With and Without
In-feed Antibiotics or Zinc Oxide on Nursery Pig Growth and
Diarrhea Occurrence

Animals and Experimental Design

A total of 144 nursery pigs (PIC L337 x C24; initially 11.314 0.08 kg and 35 days
of age) were used in a 28-day growth assay. Each pig was blocked by sex and initial
weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 6 experimental treatments using a randomized
complete block design arranged as a 3 x 2 factorial. Each pen contains 2 male and 2
female pigs. Factors were diet (negative control (NC), NC + AGP, and NC + ZnO) and
Bacillus subtilis PB6 supplementation (0 vs. 0.05%; CLOSTAT, Kemin Industries Asia
Pacific Pte. Ltd., Singapore). Each treatment had 6 replications and had 4 pigs per pen.
Each pen contained one feeding trough and one nipple waterer to provide ad libitum

access to feed and water.

Experimental Diets

A total of 6 experimental diets were formulated (Tables 1 and 2). The first diet
was a com-soybean meal diet which served as the negative control (NC). The next two
diets were the negative control diet supplemented with antibiotics (35 ppm tiamulin and
400 ppm of chlortetracycline; PC1) or 3000 ppm of zinc oxide (PC2). The last three diets

were the NC, PC] and PC2 diets supplemented with 0.05% of Bacillus subtilisPB6.

Data Collection

Daily feed allotments and individual pig BW were recorded weekly. At the
conclusion of the experiment, data were summarized and ADG, ADFI. and F/G were
calculated for each treatment for each feeding phase and for the overall 28 d feeding
period. The diarrhea score of each pen was assessed visually each day by at least 2
independent evaluators, with the score ranging from 1 to 5 (1=normal feces, 2=moist
feces, 3=mild diarrhea, 4=severe diarrhea and S=watery diarrhea), Diarrhea days were
calculated by counting pig days with a diarrhea score of 3 or greater. Frequency of
diarrhea was calculated as diarrhea days over 28 days x 100. Lastly, feed cost per pig,
value of gain per pig, feed cost per kg gain, and margin over feed cost (MOFC) were

calculated for each replicate and analyzed for each treatment.

Chemical Analysis

Samples of all experimental diets were collected and properly labeled
forsubsequent analyses. At the end of the experiment, all diet samples were analyzed for
DM by oven drying triplicate samples at 135°C for 2 h (method 930.15; AOAC, 2007).
Samples were also analyzed in triplicates for CP (method 990.03; AOAC, 2007), ether
extract (method 920.39; AOAC, 2007), crude fiber (method 978.10; AOAC, 2007), and
ash (method 942.05; AOAC, 2007). Samples of the experimental diets were also sent to
Kemin Industries Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. (Singapore) for analysis of B. subtilis PB6

concentration in the diets.

Statistical Analysis

Data was analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC) for a factorial arrangement of treatments with pen as the experimental unit. The
model included diet, probiotic, and diet x probiotic as the fixed effects and block as the
random effect. Least squares means were calculated for each independent variable. When
diet was a significant source of variation, least squares means were separated using the
PDIFF option of SAS adjusted using the Tukey-Kramer test.Linear and Quadratic
interaction was also determine in the diets supplemented with PB6. The a-level that was
used to determine significance and tendencies between means were <0.05 and <0.10.

Study 2.Effect of Exogenous Multi-enzyme Supplementation on
Growth Performance, Caloric Efficiency, Carcass Characteristics and
Diet Economics in Growing-finishing Pigs

Animal and Experimental Design

A total of 140 growing pigs (PIC 337 x C24; 47.48 + 0.25) were used in the study.
Individual pigs were blocked by initial weight and gender and randomly allotted to 1 of 5
experimental treatments using a randomized complete block design. Each treatment had 6
replications (pens) with 4 pigs per pen. Each pen contained one self-feeder and one

nipple waterer to provide ad libitum access to feed and water.

Enzyme

The multi-enzyme product (Kemzyme MAP, Kemin Industries Asia Pacific Pte.
Ltd., Singapore) is composed of a-amylase, cellulase, protease, B-glucanase, and

xylanase-pectinase complex.

Experimental Diets

The experimental diets were fed in a 3-phase diet series. All experimental diets
were formulated (Tables 3 to 10) to meet or exceed PIC (2014) nutrient recommendations
for 40 to 100 kg pigs.The first diet was a corn soybean meal diet that also contained copra
expeller and rice bran and served as the positive control (PC). The next two diets were
formulated by adding0.025% and 0.05% of the multi-enzyme (Kemzyme MAP, Kemin
Industries Asia Pacific Pte.Ltd., Singapore), respectively. to the positive control diet. The
last two diets were the negative control diet formulated to contain 90 kcal ME and 2.5%
less standardized ileal digestible (SID) amino acids compared to the positive control
supplemented with and without 0.05% MAP. The ME reduction was accomplished by
increasing the inclusion rate of copra expeller and rice bran at the expense of com and
soybean meal without adjusting the inclusion rate of coconut oil. Copra expeller and Rice
bran is used in the since both ingredients have high fiber content, and the fibers present in
this ingredients will be the substrate for the MAP used in the study. In all feeding phases
the pigs are fed ad libitum, copra expeller and rice bran were also added at greater
inclusion rates in the diet to increase dietary fiber levels. One batch of positive control

and negative control diets was prepared for each feeding phase and divided among the

26
treatments. This is to reduce the variation between the diets fed to the treatments. The
multi-enzyme was then added last and mixed to create the experimental treatments. All

experimental diets were in meal form.

Data Collection

Daily feed allotments and individual pig BW were recorded at the end of each
feeding phase with the grower phase and finisher 1 phase have a duration of 21 days each
while finisher 2 lasted for 20 days. At the conclusion of the experiment, data was
summarized and ADG, ADFI, and F/G were calculated for each treatment for each
feeding phase and for the overall feeding period. Caloric efficiencies of each pen
replicate were determined on an ME basis. The efficiencies were calculated by
multiplying total intake by the energy level in the feed (kcal ME/kg) and dividing by total
BW gain. Lastly, feed cost per pig, value of gain per pig, feed cost per kg of gain, and
margin over feed cost were calculated for each replicate and summarized for each

treatment.

Carcass Characteristics

From each pen, two pigs (1 barrow and | gilt) with the highest weight among
barrows and gilts are chosen and transported and slaughtered at the Philippine Abattoir
Development Corporation (San Fernando, Pampanga) at the end of the experiment. After
exiting the kill floor, carcasses (with head and feet on) were weighed to calculate for the
dressing percentage. The carcasses were chilled overnight, then individual carcass data,
including carcass length, HCW, backfat thickness, loin eye area, and 10" rib backfat
depth were collected. Standardized fat free lean (SFFL) and % SFFL were calculated

using National Pork Producers Council (2012) equations.

35

Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc..
Cary, NC) with pen as the experimental unit. The model included diet as the fixed effect
and block as the random effect. Least squares means were calculated for each
independent variable. Single-df contrasts were performed to compare the negative and
positive controls. When diet was a significant source of variation, least square means
were separated using the PDIFF option of SAS adjusted using the Tukey-Kramer test.
Linear and Quadratic interaction was also determine in the diets supplemented with
MAP. The a-level that was used to determine significance and tendencies between means

were 0.05 and 0.10, respectively.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Study 1. Interactive Effects of Bacillus subtilis PB6
With and Without In-feed Antibiotics or Zinc Oxide on
Nursery Pig Growth and Diarrhea Occurrence

Growth Performance

From day 0 to 7, A diet x PB6 interaction ( P = 0.04) was observed for the BW on
day 7 because if no PB6 was supplemented, pigs fed NC diet with ZnO had greater BW
than pigs fed NC diet or NC with AGP, however, no differences were observed among
diets if PB6 was supplemented.

From day 8 to 14, pigs fed the AGP diet had better (P<0.005) ADG, F/G and day
14 BW and tended (P=0.07) to have better ADF! compared with the NC and ZnO-fed
pigs. From day 15 to 21, pigs fed the AGP diet had greater (?<0.001) ADG, ADFI and
day 21 BW compared with the NC and ZnO-fed pigs. Pigs fed the AGP diet also had
better (P=0.001) F/G compared with the NC. with pigs fed the ZnO diet being not
different.

From day 22 to 28, a diet x PBG interaction (P = 0.02) was observed because if no
PBG was supplemented, the ADG of AGP-fed pigs was greater than ZnO-fed pigs and no
difference was observed between AGP and NC-fed pigs. However, if PB6 was added to
the diets, no difference on the ADG of pigs were observed between AGP and ZnO diets
but ADG of pigs fed AGP diets was greater compared to pigs fed NC diet. Overall (day 0

to 28), pigs fed the diet with AGP had improved (P<0.01) ADG, ADFI and F/G

37
compared with the NC and ZnO-fed pigs. For the overall period, supplementation of
nursery pig diets with PB6 did not improve growth performance.

The main effects of AGP in improving growth performance observed in the
present study may be explained by several mechanisms: (1) nutrients may be protected
against bacterial destruction, (2) absorption of nutrients may improve because of thinning
of the small intestinal barrier, (3) decrease in the production of toxins by intestinal
bacteria, and (4) a reduction in the incidence of subclinical intestinal infections (Hosoi et
al., 2000; Butaye et al., 2003).

Supplementing the nursery pig diets with high levels of ZnO only improved
growth rates in the first week of the study, which may be a result of the significant
reduction in diarrhea in the same period. However, the lack of an effect on overall growth
performance with ZnO supplementation suggest that though diarrhea incidence was
significantly improved, the level of diarrhea in the experiment was not great enough to
affect growth performance.

Bacillus subtilis. PB6 produce different antimicrobials, antioxidants, and
bacteriocins (Reid, 2001). These substances affect the propagation of pathogenic
microorganisms by permeating the outer membrane of gram-positive bacteria and induce
the inactivation of gram negative bacteria by stimulating antimicrobial factors such as
low ambient temperature, organic acids, and detergents (Alakomi et al., 2000). These
factors may contribute to the significant interaction observed in weeks | and 4of the
experiment, where an improvement in the growth response was observed from pigs fed

the AGP diet when PB6 was also supplemented. It is speculated that though 0.05% PB6

38
did not significantly affect growth performance, it may have created an environment in
the gut that enabled the AGP to exert greater effects.

However, the present study indicates that PB6 supplementation did not have a
positive effect on overall growth performance of nursery pigs. There are limited studies
that investigated the effects of PB6 in swine, which is a probiotic obtained from the
intestines of chickens. The results were in contrast with Che et al. (2016) and Hu et al.
(2016), which investigated the effects of adding B. subrilis PB6 supplementation to piglet
diets. In these studies, improvements in growth performance. intestinal development, and
immune function were observed. Numerous factors such as strain of the microbe, the
dose, interactions with feedstuffs and feed processing may affect the response of pigs to

probiotics.

Diarrhea Occurrence

On day 22 to 28, diarrhea score from pigs fed AGP or ZnO diets was reduced
compared with pigs fed NC diet if no PB6 was added, however, no differences among
diets were observed if PB6 was added (diet x PB6 interaction, P = 0.05).

From day 0 to 7, pigs fed the ZnO diet had lower (P=0.002) diarrhea score than
pigs fed either the NC or AGP diet, but no (P=0.16) significant differences in diarrhea
days and frequency were observed among the treatments (Table 15). Pigs fed diets
supplemented with PB6 tended (P=0.09) to have lower diarrhea score and had less
(P=0.05) diarrhea days and lower (P=0.05) frequency than those fed diets without PB6.

From day 8 to 14, pigs fed the diets supplemented with ZnO had lower (P=0.002)
diarthea score than pigs fed either the NC or the AGP diet, whereas no significant
differences were observed between the NC and the AGP-fed pigs. There was a tendency
(P=0.07) for a diet x PB6 interaction for both diarrhea days and frequency of diarrhea.
Diarrhea days and frequency of pigs fed diets supplemented with AGP were not
significantly different from those fed the NC diet; however, both became less than the
NC-fed pigs when PB6 was added to the AGP diet. In addition, pigs fed the diet with
both AGP had diarrhea days and frequency that were greater than those fed the ZnO diet
but were not different when PB6 was added to the AGP diet.

From day 15 to 21, pigs fed the AGP diet had lower (P=0.001) diarrhea score than
those fed the NC diet, but the ZnO treatment had the lowest (P=0.001) diarrhea score
among the different treatment groups. No significant differences in diarrhea days and

frequency were observed among the treatments

42

On day 22 to 28, a diet x PB6 interaction (P=0.05) was observed because diarrhea
score from pigs fed AGP diet was reduced (P<0.05) compared with NC diet if no PB6
was added, however, no differences were observed between AGP and NC diets if PB6
was supplemented. Pigs fed ZnO diets had reduced (P<0.05) diarrhea score compared
with pigs fed NC diets regardless of PB6 supplementation.

Overall (day 0 to 28), pigs fed the ZnO diet had the least (P=0.001) diarrhea score
among the treatments. Pigs fed the AGP diet also had lower (P=0.001) diarrhea score
than the NC-fed pigs. The ZnO treatment also had less (P=0.02) diarrhea days and
frequency compared with the NC treatment, with pigs fed the AGP diet being the
intermediate. Overall, PB6 supplementation did not significantly (P>0.18) improve
diarthea score; however, diarrhea days were reduced (P=0.04) by 1.94 days and
frequency of diarrhea was lessened (P=0.04) by 47% compared with those fed diets
without PB6.

The main effects of supplementing nursery pig diets with high levels of ZnO on
diarthea incidence may be due to the following mechanisms: (1) improvement in gut
microbial ecology (Pieper et al., 2012; Starke et al., 2013) which has been shown to
decrease diarrhea in disease challenge models (Owusu-Asiedu et al., 2003; Kiarie et al..
2008) and (2) specific effects on colonic morphology, mucin composition, and expression
of genes related to innate immunity and inflammatory processes in piglets (Liu et al.,
2014).This effects may contribute to the integrity of the tight junction immunity in the
cells which is important in maintaining normal digestion and absorption of nutrients. The
inflammatory effects of ZnO may contribute in maintaining the tight junction integrity

that prevents toxins and other pathogenic organisms to penetrate which causes diarrhea.

43

The observed effect of PB6 supplementation on diarrhea incidence conformed

with previous studies (Alexopoulos et al., 2004;Taras et al., 2005). In broiler chickens,
Jayaraman et al. (2013) observed that supplementation of Bacillus subtilis PB6 reduce
intestinal C. perfringens counts, increase the villi length to crypt depth ratio, and prevent
necrotic enteritis. In addition, Teo and Tan (2003) reported that B. subtilis PB6 not only
helped in the maintenance of beneficial bacteria but also could act as a replacement for
antimicrobial growth promoters in broilers. It is then possible that the observed reduction
in diarthea with weanling pigs may be due to improved microbial balance and its
subsequent effects in intestinal health. However, further studies needs to be conducted to

confirm this hypothesis.

Diet Economics

Pigs fed the diet supplemented with AGP had greater (P<0.001) feed cost
compared with those fed the ZnO and NC diets (Table 17). AGP supplementation
increased feed cost per pig by P156.25 compared with the NC diets. However, the AGP
treatment also had the highest (P<0.001) value of gain among the treatments. where
income per pig was increased by P359.91 per pig compared with the untreated controls.
In terms of feed cost efficiency, AGP supplementation also improved (P=0.05) feed cost
per kg of gain by P2.68 compared with the negative control. Margin over feed cost per
pig was also increased (P<0.001) by P203.16 with AGP supplementation. The ROI for
AGP supplementation was 1.29. Overall. adding ZnO to nursery pig diets did not
significantly improve feed cost per kg of gain and margin over feed cost per pig.

Likewise, PB6 supplementation did not improve overall economic return.

Study 2. Effect of Exogenous Multi-enzyme Supplementation on Growth

Performance, Caloric Efficiency, Carcass Characteristics and
Diet Economics in Growing-Finishing Pigs

Growth Performance

From day 0 to 21, pigs fed the NC diet had lower (P<0.04) ADG (0.856 vs. 0.948
p/day), ADFI (2.289 vs. 2.384 g/day), day 21 BW (65.64 vs. 67.39 kg) and poorer
(P=0.02) F/G (2.681 vs. 2.516) compared with those fed the PC diet (Table 18). Adding
0.05% MAP to the NC diet did not improve growth performance; however, increasing
dose of MAP to the PC diet linearly (P=0.05) improved day 21 BW due to a tendency
(P=0.09) for a linear increase in ADG

From day 22 to 42, pigs fed the NC diet had lower (P<0.001) ADG (0.772 vs.
0.862 g/day) and day 42 BW(81.86 vs. 85.51 kg) due to less (P=0.04) ADFI (2.570 vs.
2.731 g/day) compared with the PC-fed pigs.Pigs fed the NC diet supplemented with
0.05% MAP did not affect growth performance; however, a linear (P=0.02) decrease in
ADG and a linear trend(P=0.06) for poorer F/G was observed in pigs fed the PC diets
with increasing dose of MAP. Supplementing 0.05% MAP to the PC diet negatively
affected (P<0.00S) ADG compared with those fed the PC diet only. This result does not
conform in the study of Sugumar et al. (2013) which stated that supplementation of MAP
in swine diets does improve the growth performance of pigs.

From day 43 to 62, NC-fed pigs had lower (P<0.002) ADG and day 63 BW and
poorer (P=0.004) F/G compared with the PC-fed pigs. However, MAP supplementation

did not improve growth performance regardless of the diet. Overall (d 0 to 63), pigs fed

50
the NC diet had lower (P<0.02) ADG (0.776 vs. 0.873 g/day), ADFI (2.498 vs. 2.620
g/day) and poorer (P<0.001) F/G compared with those fed the PC diet. Supplementation
of MAP did not improve growth performance regardless of the diet.

Feeds with high inclusion of plant co-products tend to decrease growth
performance due to the presence of high concentrations of non-starch polysaccharides
(NSP). This may explain the poorer growth performance observed in pigs fed NC diets
compared with the PC diets. Vasanthakumari (2012) indicated that the use of alternative
raw materials negatively affects the metabolizable energy in the diets. which in tum,
reduces ME intake and available energy for growth.

Ideally, the use of MAP should improve the nutrient digestibility of feeds with
high levels of dietary fiber due to solubilization of cell wall NSP, increased protein
digestibility, hydrolysis of various amylolytic linkages in starch, and removal of anti-
nutritional factors (Sugumar and Bindhu, 2013). The positive effect of MAP observed in
the grower phase maysuggest increased nutrient digestibility and the amount of liberated
nutrients significantly improved growth. It is also possible that the inclusion rate during
the later stages was insufficient to aid the digestion and absorption of nutrients to
significantly improve growth performance; hence, no effect was observed. In addition to
this the absence of mannanase in MAP might also have an effect since the study used
copra meal in the diets. Mannans are anti-nutritional factors present in greater
concentrations in copra meal that may also negatively affect the growth performance of

the pigs. Future studies might be able to verify thisexplanation.

Caloric Efficiency

For all feeding phases and the overall period (day 0 to 63), pigs fed the NC diet
consistently had lower (P<0.02) daily ME intake compared with those fed the PC diet
(Table 19). This was due to the lower ME of the diet and the observedlower ADFI of pigs
fed the NC diet. In terms of caloric efficiency, no significant differences (P>0.14) were
observed among the treatments for all feeding phases and the overall period. No
significant differences (P>0.21) in ME efficiency was observed between pigs fed the PC
and NC diet at day 0 to 21 and day 22 to 42, but pigs fed the NC diet had poorer (P<0.02)
ME efficiency compared with those fed the PC diet at day 43 to 63 and the overall period.
Overall, pigs fed the NC diet consumed 436 kcal ME more per kg of BW gain compared
with the PC-fed pigs, which indicates that increasing by-product levels in the diet and
lower ME and AA reduces efficiency of energy use. Supplementation of MAP did not
significantly affect both ME intake and efficiency in all feeding phases and overall period
among the treatments.

The observed difference in calorific efficiency between the NC and PC treatment
may be due to the higher NSP in the NC diet, which negatively affects energy
digestibility. High fiber in NC diets tends to increase satiety and feed passage rate will be
higher compared to the PC diet (Lindberg et al., 2014). This might be the reason why
treatments with NC diet consume more feed and have poorer performance compared to
those fed the PC diets. The lack of an effect from MAP supplementation indicates that
energy digestibility of the high fiber diets were not improved at the dose of MAP used in

the experiment.

Carcass Characteristics

Live weight and HCW of pigs fed the PC diet were heavier (P<0.001) than those
fed the NC diet (Table 20). There were no significant differences in dressing percentage
among the treatments; however, pigs fed the PC diet had greater (P=0.02) dressing
percentage than those fed the NC diet. Average backfat thickness and fat depth were also
unaffected across the treatments. However, a quadratic (P=0.04) improvement in loin eye
area was observed when increasing dose of MAP was supplemented to the PC diet. As a
result, a tendency (P<0.06) for a quadratic increase in SFFL was observed with
increasing dose of MAP. The addition of 0.05% MAP to the NC diet did not improve
carcass characteristics. The results of the current study was in contrast with Thacker et al.
(2005) which stated that there are no effects in carcass quality characteristics and growth
performance of grower finishing pig when there is enzyme supplementation in the diets
using normal and high fat oats.

Significant quadratic improvement was observed in LEA but not for SFFL
(tendency only) may be explained by agreater availability of amino acids in the PC diet
due to the action of proteases included in MAP; however, the other enzymes in MAP did
not affect other carcass quality traits which may be related to insufficient level of enzyme
activities to significantly liberate enough nutrients. It is also possible that the NSP of
some of the crop by-products used in the diet did not fit the enzyme combination of

MAP.

Diet Economics

Pigs fed the NC diet had lower (P=0.005) feed cost compared with those fed the
PC diet (Table 20). On average, the difference in feed cost was P264.80 lower for NC-ted
pigs, and this was due to the lower cost of the NC diet and lower feed intake of pigs.
However, value of gain per pig was also lesser(?<0.001) than the PC-fed pigs by P713.67
per pig.Feed cost per kg of gain was not statistically different among the treatments:
however, pigs fed the NC diet had P2.73 greater feed cost per kg of gain than those fed
the PC diets. As a result, the margin over feed cost of pigs fed the NC diet were P436.99
less (P<0.001) than those fed the PC diets. Dietary addition of MAP to the diets did not
significantly affect feed cost, value of gain, feed cost per ky of gain, and margin over
feed cost per pig. This was due to the lack of significant improvements on overall growth
performance. Therefore, MAP supplementation in grow-finish pig diets only entailed

additional cost without any economic retum.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

‘Two studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Bacillus subtilis PB6
(CLOSTAT, Kemin Industries Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., Singapore) and exogenous multi-
enzymes (Kemzyme MAP, Kemin Industries Asia Pacific Pte.Ltd.. Singapore) as feed
additives in swine diets.

In Study 1, the objective was to determine the interactive effects of
supplementation of Bacillus subtilis PB6 in diets with and without in-feed antibiotics or
zine oxide on growth performance and diarrhea incidence. A total of 144 nursery pigs
(PIC L337 = C24; initially 11.314 0.08 kg and 35 days of age) were used in a 28-day
growth assay. Each pig was blocked by gender and initial weight and randomly allotted
to 1 of 6 experimental treatments using a randomized complete block design arranged as
a3 2 factorial. Factors were diet (negative control (NC), NC + AGP, and NC + ZnO)
and Bacillus subtilis PB6 supplementation (0 vs. 0.05%; CLOSTAT. Kemin Industries
Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., Singapore). Each treatment had 6 replications and had 4 pigs per
pen. Production performance and diarrhea occurrence were evaluated for each treatment.

Results were as follows:

Study 1

1) Overall (day 0 to 28), pigs fed the diet with AGP had improved (P<0.01) ADG,

ADFI and F/G compared with the NC and ZnO-fed pigs.

58
For the overall period, supplementation of nursery pig diets with PB6 did not improve

growth performance.

2) Overall (day 0 to 28), pigs fed the ZnO diet had the least (P=0.001) diarrhea score
among the treatments. Pigs fed the AGP diet also had lower (P=0.001) diarrhea
score than the NC-fed pigs. The ZnO treatment also had less (P=0.02) diarrhea
days and frequency compared with the NC treatment, with pigs fed the AGP diet
being the intermediate.

3

PB6 supplementation did not significantly (P>0.18) improve overall diarrhea
score; however, diarrhea days were reduced (P=0.04) by 1.94 days and frequency

of diarrhea was lessened (P=0.04) by 47% compared with those fed diets without

PB6.

4) Pigs fed the diet supplemented with AGP had greater (P<0.001) feed cost
compared with those fed the ZnO and NC diets; however, the AGP treatment also
had the highest (P<0.001) value of gain and margin over feed cost per pig among
the treatments.

5) Overall, adding ZnO to nursery pig diets did not significantly improve feed cost
per kg of gain and margin over feed cost per pig.

6) PB6 supplementation did not improve overall economic return.

In Study 2, the objective was to determine the effect of exogenous multi-enzyme
(Kemzyme MAP, Kemin Industries Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., Singapore) supplementation
on growth performance, caloric efficiency, carcass characteristics and diet economics in

growing-finishing pigs.A total of 140 growing pigs (PIC 337 = C24; 47.48 + 0.25 kg)

59
were blocked by initial weight and gender and randomly allotted to 1 of 5 experimental
treatments using a randomized complete block design. Each treatment had 6 replications
(pens) with 4 pigs per pen.The first diet was a corn soybean meal diet that also contained
copra expeller and rice bran and served as the positive control (PC). The next two diets
were formulated by adding 0.025% and 0.05% of the multi-enzyme (Kemzyme MAP,
Kemin Industries Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., Singapore), respectively, to the positive control
diet. The last two diets were the negative control diet formulated to contain 90 kcal
MEand 2.5% less standardized ileal digestible (SID) amino acids compared to the
positive control supplemented with and without 0.05% MAP. Growth performance,
caloric efficiency, carcass characteristics and diet economics were evaluated for each

treatment. Results were as follows:

Study 2

1) Overall (d 0 to 63), pigs fed the NC diet had lower (P<0.02) ADG (0.776 vs.
0.873 g/day), ADF (2.498 vs. 2.620 g/day) and poorer (P<0.001) F/G compared
with those fed the PC diet.

2

Supplementation of MAP did not improve growth performance regardless of the
diet.

3

For all feeding phases and the overall period (day 0 to 63), pigs fed the NC diet
consistently had lower (P<0.02) daily ME intake compared with those fed the PC

diet.

60

4) In terms of caloric efficiency, no significant differences (P>0.14) were observed

among the treatments for all feeding phases and the overall period. No significant

differences (P>0.21) in ME efficiency was observed between pigs fed the PC and

NC diet at day 0 to 21 and day 22 to 42, but pigs fed the NC diet had poorer

(P<0.02) ME efficiency compared with those fed the PC diet at day 43 to 63 and
the overall period.

5)

Supplementation of MAP did not significantly affect both ME intake and
efficiency in all feeding phases and overall period among the treatments.

6) There were no significant differences in dressing percentage among the
treatments; however, pigs fed the PC diet had greater (P=0.02) dressing
percentage than those fed the NC diet. Average backfat thickness and fat depth
were also unaffected across the treatments.

7

A quadratic (P=0.04) improvement in loin eye area and standardized fat free lean
(tendency)was observed when increasing dose of MAP was supplemented to the
PC diet.

8)

Pigs fed the NC diet had lower (P=0.005) feed cost compared with those fed the
PC diet; however, value of gain per pig was also lesser (P<0.001) than the PC-fed
pigs by 713.67 per pig.

9

Margin over feed cost of pigs fed the NC diet were P436.99 less (P<0.001) than
those fed the PC diets.
10) Dietary addition of MAP to the diets did not significantly affect feed cost, value

of gain, feed cost per kg of gain, and margin over feed cost per pig.

61

In conclusion, Bacillus subtilisPB6 supplementation at 0.05% in nursery pig diets

can improve diarrhea occurrence but does not affect growth performance. Positive
interactions of Bacillus subtilisPB6 and AGP observed in the present study should be
further evaluated. Supplementation of 0.05% MAP to grower finisher pig diets with
reduced energy and digestible amino acids and higherinclusion of agricultural by-
products do not significantly improve growth performance and caloric efficiencybut

positively affected loin eye area and carcass leanness.

2)

3)

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of this study, the author recommends to:

Use PB6 as an alternative to zinc oxide in terms of reducing diarrhea occurrence in
nursery pigs.

Conduct additional studies to determine the interaction between PB6 and AGP.
Conduct additional studies to determine the effect of greater levels of MAP in grow-

finish pig diets containing high inclusion of agricultural by-products.
