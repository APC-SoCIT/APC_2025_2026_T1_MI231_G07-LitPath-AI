Abstract

Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 remains a health threat to Filipino people According to Internationai
Diabetes Federation 2014. Philippines is one of the emerging DM2 hotspots with an estimated prevalence
rate around 3.2 million cases (5.9%) between 20 to 79 years old. In line with the acceptance of Filipino
patients with the utilization of herbal medicine as an effective alternative for treatment of their ailments, Melothria sp. (Pizi-pipino) leaves and stem (Family: Cucurbitaceae) was mvestigated for isolation of compound with a-glucosidase inhibitory effect. Exhaustive maceration using absolute ethanol was performed to extract the phytoconstituents from
the plant matrix. In vitro mammalian alpha-glucosidase inhibition assay was tested using spectroscopic
method (96 weil plates) was carried out to analyzed the mammalian a-glucosidase inhibition of different
plant samples, IC₅₀ was generated by 4-parametric logistic fit (4PL) and 5-parametric logistic fit (5PL)
extrapolated from 3 concentrations-% inhibition. TLC-Bioautography and standard phytochemical
screening method were employed to identify metabolites present in the test samples. Inhibition mechanism
of selected test samples was characterized by Lineweaver-Burk plot. Reverse phase-HPLC hyphenated by PDA was used to characterize the isolate and verify the puriiy. Previous report from preliminary screening of selected plant materials from Siba-o, Calabanga,
Camarines Sur showed that Melothria sp. (Piri-pipino) had the strongest inhibition activity (72.24% at 100
ppm) among 98 samples and from the collected plant material last October 2016, the study was able
confirmed the bioactivity (78.22% at 100 ppm) of SB32LS. The developed isolation method (Method 4,
0.009% yield trom starting material of 22.1 g crude extract) which utilized alkaline hydrolysis of condensed
tannin was able to purify a compound with retention time of 33.98 min and the purity was verified through
9 point purity index (upward and downward slope index: 0.999, threshold 1.00) using reverse phase (C18)-
HPLC hyphenated with photodiode array detector. Lineweaver-Bruk plot analysis of isolate displayed a
competitive inhibition while the crude extract and semi-purified samples (Fraction F. PVP treated crude extract and SPE 1ˢᵗ aqueous fraction) exhibited a mixed type inhibition against mammalian alpha-

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic syndrome characterized by absolute or
relative deficiencies in insulin release and/or associated with chronic hyperglycemia and
carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism disorder (Debadatta Acharya et. al., 2013)
which results in chronic complications such as microvascular, macrovascular and
neuropathic disorders (Dipiro J. et al., 2008). Type 2 diabetes is identified as a threat to
human heaith due to prevalence, medication cost and disabling complication such as
amputauions (P., Sudha et. al.,2011). The frequency of disorder is dramatically increasing
worldwide but the greatest increase was projected in developing country including the
Philippines (Jimeno C. et. al., 2015). According to International Diabetes Federation, the
estimated 2014 prevalence of Type 2 DM in the Philippines is around 3.2 millicn cases
with a 5.9% prevalence rate between the ages of 20 and 79 years (International Diabetes
Federation, 2014). Type 2 diabetes development and its associated complications, post-
prandial hyperglycemia play a key role in the management of the disease. For this reason,
the control of the post-prandial hyperglycemia is a vital treatment option for diabetes and
prevention of cardiovascular complications (Lee et. al., 2010).

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are one of the oral therapeutic agents that retard the
digestion of complex carbohydrates by inhibiting the polysaccharide-digesting enzymes
including o-amylase and a-glucosidase resulting to amelioration of the post prandial
hyperglycemia (Lee et. al., 2010). Commercially available a-glucosidase inhibitors such

as acarbose, miglitoi, and voglibose can effectively reduce the blood glucose level after

food intake. However, the use of theses agents are limited due to gastrointestinal side
effects (flatulence, vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhea) due to inhibition of lactase
(Lee et. al., 2010; Yin et. al., 2014; Dabhi A'S., et al.,2013). Phytoconstituents such as
flavonoid and anthocyanin have a-glucosidase inhibition but no reported gastrointestinal
discomfort. Therefore, there is a need for an alternative drug from the natural product that
exerts a better a-glucosidase inhibition but with minimal/without the gastrointestinal
discomfort (no lactase inhibition).

Exploration of the natural product for drug discovery have a profound impact on
human health (de Corte, B., 2016). The diverse compounds identified as natural products
are obtained from the phenomenon of biodiversity which organism-environment
interactions formulate the complex chemical entities within the organism to improve
competitiveness and enhance survival (Mishra B.B. and Tiwari, V.K. 2011). Botanical
origin natural products have been used for centuries to treat different ailments in crude
form (oils and extracts). Scientific innovation has allowed for the isolation, structural
elucidation and formulation of biological active compound from the plant materials and
pure form as drug substances are now available (de Corte, B., 2016). The extraction,

“
isolation, and bioassay for potential pharmacological applications are continuously being
studied and based on literature, there is no reported medicinal use of the chosen plant
material due to the undocumented name of the sample and unexpected therapeutic
potential. For this study, plant materials from Me/othria sp. (Cucurbitaceae) from Siba-o,

Calabanga, Camarines Sur was investigated for alpha-glucosidase inhibition.

The research was focus on isolation of secondary metabolite with mammalian
alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity as well as characterization of inhibition kinetics cf the
selected bioactive sample.

Objectives:

This research aims to isolate an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor of Melothria sp. (Piri-
pipino) leaves and stem.

Also, the study will cover the following goals:

1. To confirm the mammalian alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity of Melothria

sp. leaves and stem from preliminary screening result:

2. To analyze the mammalian alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the crude
plant extracts, semi-purified extract and isolated compound from Melothria sp.
leaves and stem;

3. To isolate an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor from semi-purified sample using the
developed isolation protocols;

4. To determine the percentage yield of isolated compound that exerts alpha-
glucosidase inhibitory effect and;

5. To analyze the in vitro mammalian alpha-glucosidase inhibition kinetic of

selected bioactive sample.

Scope and delimitations

The plant materials from Melonthria sp. leaves and stem (Piri-pipino) was collected
in Siba-o, Calabanga, Camarines Sur because the area is part of Mt. Isarog Biodiversity
Hotspot, the abundance of samples of interest, and accessible transportation of samples,
the perimeter was selected last September 2016 (wet season). The study performed a one-
time collection of the plant sample. The extent of the isolation and in vitro testing
(mammalian alpha-glucosidase inhibition assay) were limited based on tne samples
quamuties available throughout the study. In addition, the structure of the isolated
compound was not characterized and purity was qualitatively verified by RP-HPLC-PDA
only.
Significance of the study

Various synthetic agents are currently available for the reduction of hyperglycemia
in Tyre 2 DM but the management of DM with these drugs is stil! an obstacle in medical
system (Oxro. I. A., 2015). The American Diabetes Federation and European Assccialion
for the Study of Diabetes recommended Metformin as 1* line monotherapy drug in initial
therapy of DM2 when lifestyle efforts alone do not maintain the target glycemic index due
to inexpensive, reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality and long-standing
safety and efficacy. However, long term used is associated with Vitamin B12 and folate
deficiency (BMJ, 2010), mild to moderate renal impairment (US FDA, 2017) and increased
incidence of low thyroid stimulating hormone levels (TSH) in hypothyroidism treated
patients (Fournier, J.P., Yin, H., Yun Yuet. al., 2014) In addition, the US FDA informed

the healthcare professionals that the drug is contraindicated in patients with eGFR below

30mL/min/1.73 m2 and to discontinue the therapy in patients with a history of alcoholism,
liver disease or heart failure. Aside from biguanide agent (metformin), alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors remain the most popular prescribed drug in Asian countries such as Japan and
China, where rice<s a major component of diet and according to the 46 meta-analyses, the
acarbose glucose-lowering effect in Asian patients with DM2 consuming Asian diet seem
greater than in Asian in western diet (Ma, R.C.W., 2013). A direct comparison of
metformin and acarbose resulted that there was no significant difference between the
efficacy of both drugs in the reduction of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (Gu, S., et.
al., 2015). Glucosidase inhibitors are also expected to cause no hypoglycemic events if
used as monotherapy or other life-threatening effects and no weight gain (Van de Laar.,
F.A.,2008). But undesirable effects are still associated with the use of synthetic alpha-
glucosidase such as flatulence, diarrhea and bloating that lead to patient noncompliance to
the medication. For this reason, the search for inexpensive and more efiective
hypoglycemic drugs from natural resources that can prevent the sisk of Type 2 DM and
related complications has continued (Zhang et. al., 2016).

The WHO's recommendation for research on medicinal plants beneficial uses in
DM treatment and gradual demand of patients to utilize natural product gained the
momentum to investigate flora and fauna with potential applications for DM. Traditionally,
the whole or mixtures of plant materials are utilized rather than isolated constituents. Some
studies show that crude extracts often have greater activity in vitro and in vivo than isolated
compounds at the same dose (Rasoanaivo, P., Wright, C., Willcox, M. et. al.2011).

However, herbal drug are composed of different phytoconstituents that may interact with

other drugs which may enhance or inhibit their activities. Also, the current pharmacopeial
standardizations are not adequate to ensure the quality of plant materials since microscopic
examination, extraction and thin layer chromatographic analysis of raw materials and
finisned products are not reproducible (Pandey, A. and Tripathi, S., 2014). Industrially
synthesize pure drugs or isolated from plants may be chosen for their high bioactivity,
documented pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics, established interactions between the
compound and other medication and reproducible production and standardization but in
other cases, they rarely have the equivalent degree of bioactivity as of crude extract at the
same concentrations due to absence of interacting compounds present in the unrefined
extracts (Rasoanaivo, P., Wright, C., Willcox, M. et. al.,2011).

The result from preliminary screening for alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity
showed that crude extract from Melothria sp. leaves and stem (SB32) was a good candidate
for activity-guided isolation of bioactive compound.For this reason, the current research
will focus on isolation of alpha-glucosidase inhibitor from SB32. The only reported use
of the plant sample from Siba-o community is that the ripe fruit is edible. As “Iskolar ng
Bayan” the study can further educate the community in educating the people from Siba-o,
Calabanga in handling and preparation of herbal decoction if the plant material is proven
safe and effectivz. The results of this study may also be used for development of health
policy establishing the claimed use of plant sample, dissemination of recommendations of
plant undocumented effect and reduction of the environmental pollutant from the
purification associated with semi-synthetic drug production in comparison with herbal drug

production

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

Diabetes Mellitus

Diabetes Mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by
hyperglycemia associaied with carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism
abnormalities which result in chronic complications such as microvascular,
macrovascular and neuropathic disorders (Dipiro J. et al., 2008). According to
Department of Health, the diabetes incidence is one of the top 16 leading causes of
Filipino death (Leading Causes of Mortality, 5-Year Average 2005-2010). In fact,
last 2013 Food and Nutrition Research Institute-Philippines survey, the prevalence
of high fasting blood glucose based on WHO criteria of >125 mg/dL for individuals
>20 years old was 5.4%, an increase of 0.6% compared with the same study
conducted on 2008 (Tan, G..2015). Blindness, amputation and end-stage kidney
failure are complications of diabetes that increase the cost of medications (Y u-Gan,
S. 2013) and these complications reduce both life expectancy and quality of life

(Piero, M. N., Nzaro, G.M. and Njagi, J.M., 2014).

According to American Diabetes Association, diabetes may be diagnosed based
on the plasma glucose criteria, either the plasma giucose or the 2 hours piasma
glucose value afier a 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or the AJC criteria
(Fasting plasma glucose >126mg/dL (7 0 mmol/L) or 2 hour plasma glucose >200
mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT or AIC > 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) or patient
with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma
glucose >200mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). Also, the same tests are used for detection of

prediabetic individuals (International Diavetes Federation, 2016).

Classification of Diabetes Mellitus
1.1.1. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus

1.1.1. 1.Immune-mediated diabetes
Previously termed as insulin-dependent diabetes, juvenile onset
diabetes or type 1 diabetes. Resulted from a cellular-mediated
autoimmune destruction of beta-cells of the pancreas. Islet cell
autoantibodies, insulin antibodies and tyrosine phosphatses IA-2and
IA-28 are markers for pancreatic B-cells destruction (Diabetes Care,
2010).

1.1.1.2.Idiopathic diabetes

‘ Form of Type 1 DM with no known etiologies (Bastaki, S.,

2005). In this form of DM, the patients suffer varying degrees of

insulin deficiency and ketoacidosis (Diabetes Care, 2010).

1.1.2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Insulin Independent Diabetes Méellitus/Maturity-onset
diabetes/Type 2 is most common form and characterized by
insulin secretion disorders and insulin resistance (Bastaki, S.,
2005). It is often associated with abnormal obesity,
dyslipidemia, hypertension and elevated plasminogen activator.
Type 2 diabetes has a strong genetic predisposition and is more
common in all ethnic groups other than European (Dipiro J. et
al., 2008).

1.1.3. Gestational Diabetes Mellitus

The disorder has its onset in the 3" trimester of
pregnancy. Gestational DM is an operational classification
that identifying women who develop Type 1 diabetes during
pregnancy and undiagnosed asymptomatic Type 2 DM that
is determined during pregnancy (Baynes, J. 2015).

1.1.4. Other specific types of diabetes mellitus

Genetic defects of the B-cell, genetic defects in
insulin action, exocrine pancreas disease, chemical-induced
diabetes, infection cause diabetes are different types of DM
of various known etiologies that group together as “Other

Specific Types” (Baynes, J. 2015 and Diabetes Care, 2010).

1.2.Pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
Type 2 DM pathophysiology involves multiorgan and tissues including
pancreas, liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract. Progressive decline of of
pancreatic beta-cell function resulting to impaired insulin secretiom and
decrased sensitivity to insulin in muscle, liver and adipose tissue are the
hallmark features of Type 2 DM (Cornell, S., 2015).

1.2.1. Pancreas

Impaired insulin secretion is observed before the clinical onset of of

Type 2 DM. It is generally progressive and its development involves glucose

toxicity and lipotoxicity. When untreated, these cause decrease in pancreatic

beta cells mass in animal experiments. The progression of the impairment of

beta cell function greatly affects the long-term control of blood glucose. While

patients in early stages after disease onset chiefly shows an increase in

postprandial glucose as a result of increased insulin resistance and decreased

early-phase secretion, the progression of the deterioration of pancreatic beta cell

function subsequently causes permanent elevation of blood glucose.(Kaku, K.
2010).

1.2.2. Kidney and Liver

The liver and kidney posses the enzymes for

gluconeogenesis and thus produce newly formed sugar into the

circulation. It has been noted that renal glucose synthesis is

increased in Type 2 DM compare to healthy subjects. Therefore,


1.2.3,

1.2.4.

in Type 2 DM patients, the kidney futher exacerbate
hyperglycemia by increased production of glucose and
reabsorption of glucose (Comell, S., 2015).

The liver in Type 2 DM overproduce glucose due to resistant
to insulin (Comell, S., 2015). The elevated fatty acid levels may
also incrased hepatic glucose production (Mahler, R. and Adler,
M. 2009).

“

Gastrointestinal tract

Hyperglycemia in Type 2 DM downregulates gastric inhibitory
polypeptide (GIP) receptor expression reducing beta-cell response to
amino acid. This results to increase glucagon secretion, induce gastric
emptying, increase food intake and speed up the endogenous glucose
production (Sanyal, D.,2013).

Adipose tissue

In Type 2 DM, adipocytes are resistant to insulin lipolytic effect resulting
in elevated free fatty acid (FFA) circulation. Hepatic and muscle insulin
resistance, induction of gluconeogenesis and impair insulin secretion are
effects of long term increases in FFA. (Cornell. S., 2015) In addition, The
accumulation of fat in myocytes cause insulin resistance in skeletal

muscle (Abdul-Ghan, M. 2013).


1.2.5. Muscle

Reduction of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via
accumulation of fatty acid inside the muscle cell are cause by a
high circulating fatty acid levels in Type 2 DM patients and
impaired switching from fatty acids te glucose oxidation in
response to insulin due to impaired metabolic flexibility are the
key components of skeletal muscle insulin resistance (Lin, Y.
and Sun, Z., 2010).

1.3.Target mechanism of action in the study for anti-diabetic agents

Controlling and lowering the high blood glucose to normal level by
altering/improving/modulating the revitalization and stimulation of B-cells to
release insulin, improve the sensitivity and appetency/increase the amount of
insulin receptor (IR) site to insulin/insulin-like substances, liver glycogen
breakdown inhibition, incrased glucose utilization by peripheral orgarVtissue,
correction of lipid and protein metabolism and improvement of
microcirculation in the body are the main focused of present treatment of

Diabetes Mellitus (Atta-ur-Rahman Ed , 2013).

1.3.1. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitor

The a-glucosidase inhibitors decrease postprandial hyperglycemia by
slowing the rate at which carbohydrates are absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract (Craig C. and Stitzel, R. 1997). They act by
competitively inhibiting pancreatic a-amylase and intestinal brush border
a-glucosidase (glycoamylase, sucrase and maltase) resulting in retarded
hydrolysis of ingested polysaccharides, oligosaccharides and disaccharide
to monosacchride for absorption (Craig C. and Stitzel, R. 1997; Godbout A.
and Chiasson JL., 2007). The higher affinity of the drug than the natural
substrate cause slow digestion of carbohydrates and absorption which
blunted and prolong the rise of post-prandial blood glucose (Godbout A.

and Chiasson JL., 2007).

Figure II: Acarbose

The agent (Figure II from Amruta Bedekar et. al., 2010) is a pseudo-
tetrasacchride isolated from a number of species of Actinomycetes. This
potent drug is chemically known as O-4,6-dideoxy-4-[[(1S,4R,5S,6S)-
4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethy])-2-cyclohexen-1l-yl]Jamino]- a-D-
giucopyranosyl-(1 —» 4)-O- a-D-glcopyranosyl- (1 -+ 4)-D-glucose
(Amruta Bedekar et. al.,2010). The structural similarity of acarbose to
oligosaccharide is responsible for high-affinity binding (10- to 100,000
fold higher than regular oligoscchrifde from nutritional carbohydrates)
to a-glucosidase site The structure is compose of acarvisiosine (cyclitol
moiety) and an amino sugar with two glucose residues attached
(naltose). The nitrogen-linkage prevents the compound from cleavage,
block enymes hydrolysis and absorption but the binding competitive
and reversible (Godbout A. and Chiasson JL., 2007). Acarbose inhibits

weakly inhibits a-amylase.


Also, the drug inhibits different a-giucosidases in the following
order: glucoamylase > sucrose > maltase > isomaltase (Amruta Bedekar
et. al., 2010). Acarbose is indicated as monotheraphy or in combination
with sulfonylureas. It is metabolized by instetinal bacteria within
gastrointestinal tract and excreted in the urine (metabolite). There is no
risk of hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy since acarbose is not
an insulin secretagogue but the risk increases when used in combination
with other insulin secretagogues (Troy, D., 2007).

Chemically known as J-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-(hydroxymethy!)-[2R-

from mulberry tree leaves (M. elba, M bombycis or M. nigra). It is a
white to yellow powder prepared by removal of hydrogen on C-1 by
regioselective oxidation with Gluconobacter oxvdans to form 1
deoxynojirimycin and the amine hydrogen is replaced by a

hydroxyethyl group (Troy, D., 2007).

The mechanism of action 1s similar to acarbose but miglitol is a
competitive inhibitor of digestive enzyme as glucose substitute. Miglitol
inhibits all digestive enzymes in the following order:
sucrose>glucoamylase>isomaltase>laciase>trehalase and some a-
amylase inhibition (Amruta Bedekar et. al., 2010). Miglitol is a good
choice of therapy for patients with relative risk of developing
hypoglycemia, weight gain or lactic acidosis. The same efficacy is
observed as acarbose at lesser dose. In comparison with sulfonylureas,
miglitol provides a better fasting and post prandial glucose reduction in
patient (Amruta Bedekar et. al., 2010).

1.1.3.3. Voglibose

Figure IV: Voglibose
Voglibose (Figure IV) 5-(1,3-dihydroxypropan-2-ylamino)-1
(hydroxymethy!)cyclohexane-1,2,3,4-tetrol was discovered from
validamyan on culture media-the producing organism was Streptomyces
hygroscopicies var. limonons. lt also competitively inhibits (reversible)
glucoamylse, sucrose and zolmaltase (Amruta Bedekar et. al.,2010:

< Dabhi A.S., et al.,2013). The structural similarity to oligosaccharides,


starch derviatives and presence of valiolamine moiety linked to
propanediol moiety with nitrogen role plays a vital role im the agent’s
activity (Amruta Bedekar et. al.,2010). No inhibitory activity against a-
amylase and lactase which does not cause diarzhea and lactose
intolerance (Amruta Bedekar et. al.,2010; Dabhi A.S., et al.,2013). In
addition, the compound facilitate mobilisotary o. endogenous glycogen-
like peptide 1 (GLP-1) which has glycogen inhibitory effect. Treatment
with voglibose increase the GLP-1 secretion which enhance insulin
sensitivity and secretion. Voglibose is indicated in Type 2 DM as
<immunotherapy, combination therapy with other OHAs and addition

to insulin therapy (Dabhi A.S., et al.,2013).

1.4.Biguanides

The clinical use of Biguanides is practically limited to Metformin,due to
complete withdrawal of phenformin and buformin (Khulmann, J., and Puls,
W., 1996). The next section will review the proposed mechanism of action and

side effects associated with the use of Metformin in DM2.


1.4.1. Metformin

Figure V: Metformin

Metformin (Figure V) is the 1* line drug used for DM2 particularly in an
obese patient. Reduce diabetes mortality and complications by 30% compared to
other DM medications like insulin, glibenclamide, and chlorpropamide has been
documented (Narri, H., and Rafieian-Kovaei, M., 2014). Several mechanisms of
action have been proposed in Metformin, notably, it increases the effects of
insulin. Also, the drug reduces endogenous glucose production via
gluconeogenesis inhibition, delay in glucose uptake, an increase of glucagon-like
peptide 1 release, activation of the AMP-activated kinase in liver cells, inhibition
of glycolytic enzymes, glucagon signaling, gluconeogenesis enzymes
transcription or mitochondrial complex I (Phimister, E.G., 2014).

Gastrointestinal intolerance, reduction of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)
absorption due to calcium-dependent ileal) membrane antayonism, allergic
pneumonitis, and cholestatic jaundice are some of the adverse effects reported
with the use of Metformin as monotherapy drug (Rojas, L.B.A., and Gomes,

M.B.,2013).


2.Preliminary screening for alpha-glucosidase study.

Mt. Isarog is a distinct sub-region of the Southern Luzon biogeography zone due to
its ecosystem diversity. Approximately 1,300 flora have been reported and more studies
are still on-going. Several species of endemic reptiles, birds, and mammals have been
noted in Mt. Isarog since 1961 and have been the cause of biodiversity conservation.
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and World Wildlife
Fund (WWF) declared Mt. Isarog as one of the Centers of Plant Diversity and
Endemism in the Philippines and Centers for Animal Diversity and Endemism being
part of the Luzon faunal region. The municipalities surrounding Mt. Isarog (Naga,
Calabanga, Tinambac, Goa, Tigaon, Ocarapo and Pili) are parts of the rich pool of
indigenous and endemic species (Bradecina, R.,2007). For this reason, Siba-o, Naga
was selected as the study site for this study due to abundances of SB32 and SB54L in
the area and accessibility to the transportation of samples.

Different plant materials were collected from Siba-o, Calabanga, Camarines Sur in
August 2014. Samples were tagged with code for identification purpose. JLast June and
July 2016, the stored biomasses were used for screening of active crude extract with
alpha-glucosidase inhibition using the reported method of Shai et. al., 2011.

Table 1 summarizes the inhibition of samples at different concentration in alpha-
glucosidase from rat intestinal acetone powder (Sigma-Aldrich®). In addition, selected
plant extracts that exhibited 50% hibition against mammalian alpha-glucosidase were

further analyzed at higher concentration (10C ppm)


Among the 98 crude extracts analyzed, Cleome rutidosprerma (SB48) and
Melothria sp. leaves and stem (SB32) as shown in Table 2 exhibited concentration-
dependent inhibition activity against mammalian alpha-glucosidase in vitro. The results
lead to further analysis with respect to alpha-glucosidase inhibition by an ICso
determination by extrapolation of the graph (% inhibition vs. 3 different concentrations
of each plant from table 1), the 2 extracts exert inhibition at 49.24 ppm and 42.95 ppm,
respectively. Calculated ICso of the Me/othria sp, was lower than acarbose IC50=53.54
ppm (calculated using linear regression). Unfortunately, the collection cf SB32 and
SB48 for isolation and structure elucidation of active compound will be challenging
because based on previous experience of Dr. Marilou G. Nicolas in collecting SB48W
and SB32 last August-September 2014 and 2015, they always gathered less than 1 kg
dried basis of both species. In addition, $B32 and SB48 grow annually which limit the
supply of sample tor further investigations (Merill, AD. 1912; Anuradha Khurtia et.

al., 2013).

2. Characterization of plant samples investigated in details:

2.2.

Z.1.

Family Cucurbitaceae

Annual tendril-bearing vine with alternate, simple, lobed or divided,
usually cordate leaves. Flowers are regular, monoecious or dioecious,
solitary, racemed, umbellate or panicled. The calyx-tube adnate to the
ovary, the limb tubular or campanulate, 5-lobed. Five petals. more or less
united or sometimes free, the lobes entire of fimbriated. Stamens usually
3, sometimes 2 or 5; anthers free or united, the cells straight or
conduplicate. Ovary inferior, 3-celled; styles 1 to 4, usually 1 with 3
stigmas; ovules many, on parietal placentae. Fruit is smal] to very large,
fleshy or ultimate dry, indehiscent, or dehiscing by valves or by an
operculum. Seeds are numerous, usually embedded in pulp of fiber, often
compressed, frequently wrinkled. Ninety-six (96) genera, 750 species in
the warmer parts of the entire werld especially in the tropics, 14 genera
ana about 30 species in the Philippines (Merili, E.D. 1912).

Genus Melothria

Climbing, usually slender herbs, the tendrils simple or 2 fids. Leaves
deltoid-ovate, base truncate or cordate, entire or lobed, usually scabrous.
Fiowers are small, monoecious, pedicellate, axillary. Calyx-tube short,
teeth. Corolla 5-partite. Male flowers with 3 stamens inserted on the
middle of the calyx-tube. Female flowers with an oblong ovaty; stigmas.

Fruit is globose to ellipsoid or fusiform. Seeds are small, numerous.


2.3.

About 55 species are disuributed in tropical region, 4 or S in the
Philippines (Merill, E.D. 1912)

Melothria sp.

Pakwan-daga (a common name for Melothria sp, from Dr. Edwino
S. Fernando of Institute of Biology, College of Science, University of the
Philippines Diliman) or Piri-Pipino (Wild Cucumber, a local name of
plant sample in Siba-o community) is an undocumented plant species
from Cucurbitaceae family. However, from unpublished work of Dr,
Leonard L. Co (Co's digital Flora of the Philippines), The investigator
reported that the identity of the plant was Melothria palida.
Unfortunately, Internationa] Plant Name Index and Plantlist.Org do not
officially recognize Melothria palida and additional study using new
method for plant identification and verification such as DNA barcoding
hyphenated with traditional method-voucher specimen preparation will

help to clarify the unresolved name of Piri-pipino.

In vitro anti-diabetic models

Antidiabetic effects of botanical extract and their active compound can be
assessed in vitro using variety of test systems. In vitro tests play an important role
as intial screening tools or as additional test to human or animal studies. Perfused
whole organs, isolated tissues, cells in primary or immortal cultures, subcellular
membrane or purified receptors and ezymes are biological materials used in these
model. (Dsouza, D. and Lakshmidevi, N., 2015).

For this study, in vitro assay (alpha-amylase and piphaeplucosidste) will be
used because the target activity is based on specific biological process (retardation
of carbohydrate digestion and absorption) relevant to the disease and its treatment.
The advantages of in vitro assay’s in ethnobotanical research and drug discovery are
the following: less amount of materials are needed than clinical and animal studies,
more economical per sample tested, reduced animals use which provide altemative
way of testing the sample, availability of cel! lines or tissues derived from one
animal offer genetic homogeneity results to reduced variability, readily adoptable
for automation and fast throughput study and bioassay guided isolation.
Nonetheless narrow mechanism based assay detect only a particular mechanism of
action, no accounts in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of test
sample, effective concentration range may seen effective in vitro but irrelevant in
vivo and presence of interfering compound are the disadvantages of in vitro assays.
(Cordell G.A. et. al. 2002 ) Appendix A summarizes the published in vitro

antidiabetic assays.

Figure X: Conceptual framework of the study
The bioaciivity (alpha-glucosidase inhibition) is the identified dependent variable
in the study (Figure IX). The inhibition activity is dependent on sample purity and
concentration (Independent variables). The presence of impurity in the tested sample
may affect the inhibition activity by masking the bioactivity in various ways such as
potentiation or synergism between componenis or interference of the activity leading
to the false negative result. In addition, increasing the concentration of sample may

increase inhibition activity if the bioactivities are concentration-dependent.


4.2. Operational definitions:

Alpha-glucosidase inhibiton activity: A greater than 1.00% inhibition is calculated from
alpha-glucosidase inhibition assay using mammalian a-glucosidase (rat intestine acetone
powder) as enzyme source and 4-nitrophenyl-a-D-glucopyranoside as substrate.

Bioactive sample: the sample that exhibited the highest in vitro alpha-glucosidase
inhibition at 100 ppm concentration (highest concentration used in the assay).
Concentration: the amount of sample in micrograms dissolve in suitable solvent in
milliliters and expressed as parts per million (ppm).

Detection reagents: solution(s) sprayed into the dried TLC chromatogram to derivatized
the unknown constituents in the test sample.

1Cso: Inhibition Concentration 50; Sample concentration that exerts 50% inhibition against
mammalian or yeast alpha-glucosidase calculated by 4 or 5 parametric logistic regression.
The ICso was calculated if the test sample achieved at least 50% inhibition at 100 ppm
(highest concentration used in the assay).

One-time collection: The plant materials for the study was collected only on August-
September and there will be no recollection due to insufficient amount of samples.
Semi-puiified sample. fractions collected fom column chromatography, modified
kupchann method or/and other purification techniques wherein the purity was not verified
using RP- HPLC-PDA

Simple cluster random sampiing: a sampling techniques wherein the plant materials for the
study was collected by chance and the same plant samples have an equal chance to be
included in the sample at a particular quadrant of the study sites (Siba-o, Calabanga,
Camarines Sur, Philippines) .


Isolate: Only one peak is detected in HPLC-PDA using the optimize chrornatographic

conditions.

4.3. | Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis 1: There is no significant difference between the alpha-glucosidase in vitro
mammalian inhibition activity between the crude plant extract, semi-purified extract,
isolated compound, acarbose, epicatechin, ellagic acid, o-coumaric acid, and ellagic acid
(reference standards).

Alternative Hypothesis 1: There is a significant difference between the alpha-glucosidase
in vitro mammalian inhibition activity between the crude plant extract, fraction, semi-
purified extract and isolated compound, acarbose, epicatechin, ellagic acid, o-coumaric

acid, and ellagic acid (reference standards).

Locale of the study: This study plant samples collection was conducted in private field
located at Siba-o, Calabanga, Camarines Sur. Because the area is part of Mt. Isarog
Biodiversity Hotspot, the abundance of samples of interest and accessible transportation of

samples, the perimeter was selected.


Plant Materials Collection and Extraction
A. Sampling of plant materials

Melothria sp. leaves and stem (the age of the plant species was determined
by the field botanist and the collected samples with different ages were tested as
sample mixtures) was harvested at Siba-o, Calabanga, Camarines Sur using single
cluster random sampling. The processed voucher specimen was submitted to the
Institute of Biology, University of the Philippines Diliman for authentication. The
plant materials were washed with running tapped water to remove adhering dust
particles and other contaminants and air-dried for 2 weeks at room temperature until
crisp. The dried plant metrials was garbbled immeaditely to avoid cross
contamination from other plant parts. The plant sample was milled into fine powder
using an osterizer and the moisture content (< 10%) was maintained by storing the
samples in airtight resealable plastic bag with dessicant.

B. Extraction of selected botanical materials.

The powdered plant material was exhaustively macerated thrice with
absolute ethanol for 3 succesive days with constant shaking using an improvised
mechanical shaker for optimum secondary metabolite extraction as decribed by
Akindele et. al.,2015. The resulting mixtures was filtered using Whatmann filter
paper no.40 (Ashless). The filtrates were combined and concentrated to about 100

mL using a rotary evaporator. The crude extract was stored at -4°C prior to use.

C. Phytochemical screening of crude extract using TLC-Bioautography:

The protocol for phytochemical screening by Guevara, 2007 was adopted.
Crude extract and/or semi-purified sample (20u4L) was placed in normal phase
Silica Gel GF2s4 TLC plates (2 X 10 cm) with aluminum backing. Chromatograms
were developed using optimized solvent systems: 80:20 Chloroform: Methanol.
The spots was identified by spraying with different detection reagents (Table 3) and
developed by incubating at oven at prescribed temperature,treated with another
reagents or view under UV Illuminator.

Melothria sp. crude extract using method 1.


1.1 Column chromatography

The reported work from Sheng, Z. et. al.,2014 with modifications was used
for initial purification of crude extract. Two grams (2g) of crude extract was mixed
with 2 grams silica slurry and allowed to dry under the fumehood. A silica slurry
was prepared by dissolving 100 grams of normal phase silica (Merck®) in organic
solvent. The silica mixture was packed in the column and constantly tapped to
remove the bubbles during pouring. After packing, 250 mL of optimized solvent
systems consisting of (80:20 Chloroform:Ethyl acetate, 100 Ethyl acetate, 50.50
Methanol: Chloroform, 100 Methanol, 50:50 methanol:water and deionized water
for purging) were loaded to solvent reservoir to separate the phytoconstituents.

Ten milliliters (10 mL) of eluate were collected. Each fraction was spotted
in normal phase TLC plates with aluminum backing, developed with the optimized
solvent system and fractions with the same R¢ value were pooled together. Six semi-
purified fractions, labeled Fraction A-F were obtained. The concentrated samples
were tested for enzymes inhibition (a-glucosidase) and the sample with lowest

inhibition was further purify.


1.2.1. Column chromatography of semi-purified fractions (Fraction C)

The modified method from published work of Sheng, Z. et. al.,2014 with
modifications was performed to further purify Fraction C. The constituents (glycosylated
flavonoids) from fraction C from the above method was further separated using another
round of column chromatography. Sample preparation and silica packing were performed
using the same procedure above. The solvent sytem consisting of 100% Chloroform, 80:20
Chloroform: Ethyl acetate, 50:50 Chloroform ethyl acetate, 100 Ethyl acetate, 100
Meihanol, 50:50 methanol: water were used to separate the consitutents. Pooling of
fractions was also perfomed using Rr values as basis. Nine fractions (Fraction C1-C9)
were collected, concentrated by evaporation and re-assayed for mammalian glucosidase
inhibition.

1.3. Modified Kupchann of fraction F from ccliumn chromatography
The method of Van Wagegen, et. al 1993 with moditcations was applied to further
purify fraction F. Condensed tannin from fraction F of 1 round of column chromatography
was refined by partitioning 50 mL of the aqueous solution of fraction F with equal amount
of n-hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate. Organic fractions were evaporated to dryness
“
while aqueous fraction was lyophilized. The fractions (Fraction MK-Hex, MK-Ch, MK-

EA and MK-aq) were re-assayed for mammalian-glucosidase inhibition.


1.4. Alkaline alcoholic precipitation of aqueous fraction from mcdified

kupchann

The removal of tannin was performed according to the method of Gong, X., Li Y.
and Qu Haibin, 2014 with modifications. A portion of powdered aqueous fraction from
modified kupchann was dissolved in absolute ethanol, treated with 35% w/v ethanolic
NaOH, stirred occasionally (30 min) and refrigerated at -4°C (24 hrs). After
refrigerating the samples, the supernatant (Tannin-free) was decanted tc separate
container and evaporated to dryness. On the othez hand, the residue (tannin rich sampie)

was sel aside. The concentrated supernatant was assayed for mammalian glucosidase

inhibition.

2.1. Alkaline alcoholic precipitation of crude extract.

Separation of tannin from the test sample was conducted based on the report
of Gong, X., Li Y. and Qu Haibin, 2014 with modifications. Twenty grams (20
g) of crude Melothria sp. extract was dissolved in 200mL absolute ethanol and
200 mL of 35% w/v alcoholic NaOH was added. The alkalinized solution was
then occasionally agitated for 30 mins using improvised mechanical shaker and
refrigerated at -4°C for 24 hrs. After refrigeration, the supernatant was decanted

and evaporated to dryness. From the supernatant portion a yellow-green crystal


and resinous matter was recovered and assayed for mammalian glucosidase
inhibition.

2.2. Column chromatography of resinous matter from crude alcoholic
precip‘<ation.

The column chromatography method was performed based on work of
Sheng, Z. et. al.,2014 with modifications. Sample preparation and silica packing
were conducted using the method described in Section 1.1 except that a
different mobile phase was employed. The optimize solvent systems composed
of 100 Chloroform, 50:50 Chloroform. Methanol, 20:80 Chloroform: Methanol,
100 Methanol, 50:50 Methanol: water. Fractions were pooled together based on
Rf value similarity and concentrated by evaporating the solvents inside the
fumehood. The resulting fractions (Fraction A-M) were assayed for mammalian

inhibitory activity.

3.1. Tannin removal of crude extract using polyvinylpyrrolidone.

The separation of tannin from the crude extract was executed using the published
method of Spiegler et. al., 2015 with modifications. Seven grams (7 g) of crude SB32
extract were dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water and polyvinyl pyrollidone (PVP) was
then added in the ratio of 1:1 to the sample solution. The mixture was continuously shaked
for about 35 minutes using an improvised mechanical shaker, filtered and the resulting

filtrate was freeze dried.


3.2. Purification of filtrate from PVP treatment using modified Kupchann method.

The recovered samples after PVP treatment was purify using the method of Van
Wagegen et. al. 1993 with modifications. Two grams (2g) of the lyophilized sample was
dissolved in 50 mL deionized water. The solution was successively partitioned with 50 ml
each of n-hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate. Solvent-solvent partioning was done three
times for each solvent. The fractions were pooled together, concentrated and tested for in
vitro alpha-glucosidase inhibition assay.

3.3. Solid phase extraction of aqueous fraction from modified Kupchann

The active fractions from Modified Kupchann (Aqueous fraction) was subjected to
solid phase extraction as describe by Zam et. al, 2012 with modification. Aqueous fraction
(iyophilized) from modified kupchann was dissolved in 45 mL deionized water. The
reverse phase- C18 cartidge (500 mg stationary phase} was equilibrated with 45 mL
methanol followed by 45 mL water. Sample was loaded to the cartriges and the aqueous
eluate was collected. Elution was conducted using the following solvent systmes in
succession: 45 mL water, gradient system of water:acetone (80:20, 50:50 ,20:80). Pure
acetone was used as the last mobile phase to recover the retained tannin from the stationary
phase. The resulting fractions were subjected to rotary evaporator to remove the organic

solvent. freeze dried and re-assayed for inbihibition activity.

4.2. Hydrolysis of aqueous fraction from modified Kupchann

The method proposed by Watson et. al, 2014 was used in this section. Freeze-dried
aqueous fraction from modified Kupchann was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to convert
the condensed tannin into it’s monomer component. Test sample (200 mg) was dissolved
in 50 mL 3.3 M NaOH solution and refluxed at 80°C for 60 min. The resulting solution
was cooled down to room temperature and partitioned thrice with equal amount of ethyl
acetate 10 recover the monomer unit of tannin. The ethyl acetate was air dried inside the

fumehood to obtained a clear colorless needle like crystal.

Il. In vitro enzymes inhibition assays
A. Spectrophotometric endpoint analysis of mammalian a-glucosidase
inhibition.

The spectral analysis of mammalian a-glucosidase inhibition assay was performed
based on work of Mohamed, S.S. et. al.,2011 and modified enzymatic preparation from
Kang, B.H., et. al.,2015. The basis of antidiabetic activity of the samples was analyzed by
mammalian a-glucosidase inhibition assay due to the relative correlation of rat intestine a-
glucosidase to human. The crude plant extracts were dissolved with 100%
dimethylsulfoxide at different concentrations. One millimolar (1 mM) of the substrate, p-
nitropheryl glucopyranoside, was prepared in 50 mM pH 6.8 phosphate buffer with 100
mM NaCl. In 96-well flat-bottom plates, 50 nL of phosphate buffer saline pH 6.8 and
25uL of varying ‘concentrations of crude plant extracts were added followed by SOpL of
1mM substrate. After addition of the solutions to individual wells, the microplate was

incubated for 5 min at 37°C inside the microplate reader.


The sample plate was removed after incubation and 25 pL of 33.33 mg/mL a-
glucosidase from rat intestine acetone extract. Enzyme solution was prepared by extracting
fifty milligrams (50 mg) of rat intestine acetone powder and 1.5 mL of 50 mM pH 6.8
phosphate buffer with 100 mM NaCl. Mixture was vortex mixed, sonicated for 5 minutes
and centrifuged for 30 min. at 10,000 X g, 4°C. Resulting supernatant was used for the
assay. The reaction mixture was reincubated at 37°C and the reaction was terminated with
the addition of 0. 1M sodium carbonate solution. Phosphate buffer saline with
dimethylsulfoxide was used as negative control and Acarbose secondary standard to
European Pharmacopeia was used as positive control. To subtract the absorbance due to
colored plant extracts, wells containing buffer and test samples were allocated with
separate wells. In addition, the absorbance due to yellow color of crude mammalian
enzyme was eliminated by adding also a separated wells containing buffer and enzymes.
Spectral changes was monitored by analyzing the para-nitrophenol released from the
substrate at 405 nm using BMG® microplate reader and the data were generated through
Omega program version 3.10 R6. Assay was performed in triplicate 3 wells per plate. The
percentage inhibition will be calculated by using the equation below:

[(Ac — Ae) — (As — Ab)]
Ac — Ab

% Inhibition =

Where Ac, As, Aeand Apare the absorbance of negative conirol, sample and
background to eliminate absorbance made by plant pigments from crude plant

extract and yellowish appearance from mammalian enzyme respectively.


B. Determination of inhibitory concentration (ICso)

The ICso calculation of test samples that achieved 50% inhibition at 100
ppm was adopted from the report of Liao, J. and Liu., R., 2008. Quantitative
bioassay are frequently analyzed using logistic function to model the dose-
response. Four-parameter logistic function (4PL) (Figure ) is one of the
commonly used forms due to practical interpretations such as a and d are the
asymptotes, b is the shape parameter which controis the speed of symptotes and
C is the halfway response.

Where a=minimum value obtained, b=Hill’s slope of the curve, c=point of

However, 4PL assume symmetry about the ICso vaiue which introduced
bias due to lack of it. To address the drawbacks of the 4PL function, five-
parameter logistic (SPL) function (extra parameter, m was introduced for correct
calculaticn due to asyrnmetry) was also used in this study. The ICso of samples
that exert 50.00% inhibition at 100ppm (highest concentration used in the assay)
was calculated using 4PL and SPL with the aid of XLstat® software.

The characterization of mode of inhibition of selected bioactive samples
was performed according to the method of Kazeem et. al., 2013. The bioactive
samples was evaluated for rat intestine alpha-glucosidase inhibition kinetics order.
The type of inhibition was analyzed by plotting the Lineweaver-Burk performed
by increasing the concentrations of substrate (0.25-5 mM) in the absence or present
of inhibitors at different concentrations depending on samples availability. Spectral
reading of p-nitrophenol was conducted at 40S5nm using 96 well microplate reader
(BMG®) every second for 60 min and the raw data was generated through Omega
program version 3.10 R6. The assay was performed in tnplicate 3 (each substrate
concentration) wells per plate.

Qualitative Instrumental analysis of isolated compound using Reverse Phase-
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with PDA detector.

The analysis of monomeric unit of condensed tannin recovered from
alkaline hydrolysis was conducted according to the reported work of Jiang, G. and
Zhang, T.,2011 with modifications. Purity and other components of the isolated
compound present in ethyl acetate fraction was verified using RP-HPLC-PDA. The
isolate solution from enzyme assay was dissolved with an equal amouni of

methanol HPLC grade to prepared a 50 ppm sample for HPLC analysis.

Shimadzu HPLC unit equipped witn DGU-2GA SR Degassing Unit, Nexera
X2 LC30AD Pump, CBM20A Commurication Channel, Nexera X2 Sil-30 AC
autosampler and Nexera X2 SPD-M30A diode array detector was utilized for
qualitative analysis of the sample. Reverse Phase C-]8 column (Sorbent 5um
Purospher® Lichrocart) was used for the chromatographic separation, the mobile
phase containing a gradient mixture of methanol (Solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid
in water (Solvent B). The gradient system was programmed to (Time/Solvent
A%/Solvent B%) 0 min/0O%/100% ,60min/100%/0% and 70min0%/100%. The
injection volume was 10 pl. The flow rate of mobile phase was 1.0 min/mL, and the
elution was monitored at 220-400 nm for phenolic compounds.
Statistical Analysis.
All quantitative analysis was performed in triplicate. Experimental results were
expressed as means+ standard deviation. The level of significance is taken at 95%
confidence interval (a of 0.05). XLStat® Software was used for statistical analysis of all

raw data.


CHAPTER IV

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Identification of phytochemicals from Melothria sp. (Piri-pipino) crude extract using TLC-

Bioautography

A total of 98 plant samples were tested for mammalian alpha-glucosidase

inhibition. Out of the 98 samples, the crude extract of Melothria sp. (Piri-pipino) leaves

and stem (SB32) was the only test sample that exhibited 70% inhibitory effect at 100ppm

(Kamantigue, E. Solidum, J. Quiming, N. Nicolas, M. and Pidlaon, S. for publication). Due

to the promising results of Piri-pipino crude extracts, the secondary metabolites present in

the test sample must be identified and TLC-Bioautography was selected because of fast,

inexpensive and practical application for routine analysis.

Table 4 summarizes the results of phytochernical screening of SB32LW using
TLC Bioautography. This initial investigation will aid the rationale behind the active
compounds found in the sample that may be responsible for the activity. Phenolic
compounds, for instance are detected on SB32LS, flavonoid and tannins are ubiquitous
in nature and health benefit effects on human health such as antioxidant (free radical
scavenging), antimicrobial, inhibition of triglycerides deposition, anti-inflammatory and
reduction of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and
cancer have been proven (Delikanli, B. et. al.,2014). Many flavonoids weakly inhibit rat
small intestine a-glucosidase, slightly by the isoflavone (genistein and daidzein with mixed
type of inhibition) and anthocyanidin group (cyanidin) in vitro (Tadera, K_ et. al. 2006). It
was reported that flavonoid glycosylation diminishes the a-glucosidase inhibitory activity
depending on class of sugar moiety and conjugation site. Increase in polarity, molecular
size and transfer to the non-polar structure are the proposed reason for decreasing inhibition
activity after glycosylation (Xiao, J. Kail, G., Yamamoto, K and Xiaoging C., 2013}. On
the other hand, tannins exert anti-diabetic activity by inducing insulin-sensitive tissues,
retardation of blood glucose absorption and non-specific inhibitors of a-amylase and a-
glucosidase.

The proanthocyandin content of tannins determines the extent of inhibitory effect
against the enzyme (McCreath S.B. and Deigoda, R., 2017). Although tannins have
inhibitor effect against carbohydrate digesting enzymes, this phytoconstituent have low
impact and priority for drug discovery (Binh T.D Trinth, Dan Starerk and Anna K

Jagger.,2016). Bands with Rr value of 0.37, 0.79 and 0.84 were interpreted as phenolic


compounds. There were no available literatures that suggest a probable mechanism of
essential oil and indole containing compound as glucosidase inhibition. Regardless,
researches of essential oil from other medicinal plant like Ocimum sanctum was verified
good antidiabetic agent by reduction of blood sugar, triglycerides, cholesterol, LDH,
alkaline phosphatase, GPT and GOT in blood serum (Tanu, B. and Harpreet., K., 2016).
Essential oils from SB32LW were detected with Rr value of 0.26, 0.37, 0.84 and 0.90.
Indole, a parent compound of multiple compounds that occur in nature namely tryptophan,
serotonin and strychnos alkaloid. Indole as core nucleus of new therapeutic molecule may
replace many approved drugs in the future especially in disorder such as cancer (cediramib,
apazaquinone), hypertension (perindopril, pindolol), HIV (ateviridine, delavirdine) and
depression (binedaline, amedalin) (Kaushik N.K.,et al., 2013). The observed band with Rr

value of 0.79 was positive for presence of indole related compound.

Developmement of activity-guided isolation method for mammalian alpha-glucosidase
inhibitor.

Bioactive compounds from crude extract composed of thhousand compounds,
thus, a combination of several purification methods and identification using
chromatographic techniques have to be done to isolate the active principle with high purity.
This is often the inherent bottleneck for utilization and characterization of the target
compound. Furthermore, testing in vitro must be performed in each purification process to
ensure removals of artifacts. Thus, different bioactivity-zuided isolation sirategies were
developed for pré:iminary study of Melothria sp. (Piri-pipino) crude extract to obtain the
compound with mammalian glucosidase inhibitory effect. However, isolation method 4
was the only protocol that was able to successfully purify a single compound with an aipha-
glucosidase inhibitory effect. For the sake of scientific contribution and fiyther
improvement of the other isolation methods reported in this study, the output from method
1 to 3 were also discussed.

Before the analysis of the fractions, different standards for a-glucosidase inhibition
were explored in the study to represent the different polyphenois that can be obtained from
natural product and serve as reference standard for enzyme inhibition aside to acarbose
(pesudotetrasaccharide). Ellagic acid (non-flvanoid polyphenol), Epicatechin (monomeric
flavonols) , o-coumaric acid (phenolic acid) and tannic acid (tannin) (Tsao, R., 2010) were

included as additional standards.

different concentrations. Kruskal-Wallis test revealed that at 10 ppm (p>0 647) and 100
ppm (p>0.032) concentrations have significant differences in inhibiting the mammalian
enzymes. However, at 20 ppm there was no statistical difference between the group of
standards (p<0.133). The ICso of the test sample was calculated if a 50% inhibition was
achieved at 100 ppm using 4-parametric logistic regression (4PL) and 5-parametric logistic
regression (SPL). The calculated ICso of acarbose was 1.523 ppm (4PL) and 1.474 ppm
(SPL).

Additional statistical analysis using Mann-Whitney test of individual reference
standards reveal that at 10, 20 and 100 ppm concentrations, there were no statistical
differences between each standards (p>0.05, a=0.05 see appendix for the details). The
results indicate that the inhibitory activities of acarbose, epicatechin, tannic acid, ellagic

acid and o-coumaric acid with respect to mammalian a-glucosidase were ihe same.


Method 4 was developed to release the monomeric flavan-3-ols units bound to each
other by interflavan linkages from the semi-purified condensed tannin (proanthocyanidins)
purified through Method 1 (Aqueous fraction from modified Kupchann of fraction F).
Alkaline hydrolysis was conducted over acid hydrolysis because the alkali (NaOH) can
reduce the loss of phenolic compounds and more effective in cleaving the ester bonds
which iink phenolic acids to the cell wall (Vanhoutte. H., 2014).

In the attempt to purify the sample from the degradants after the alkaline hydrolysis,
modified Kupchann method was performed after allowing the solution to cool down at
room temperature. After three successive partitioning of alkaline solution with equal
amount of ethyl acetate, the organic phase was recovered, combined and concentrated, a
clear colorless needle crystals was formed and carefully filtered. A portion of crystalline
sample was stored at -4°C for HPLC analysis and enzymatic assay.

To confirm that the crystalline samples were not due to the presence of sodium
sulfate (salt used to break the emulsion during modified Kupchann) and sodium hydroxide
(base used during the alkaline hydrolysis), a blank sample composed of 1 g of sodium
sulfate dissolved in 3.3 M NaOH (Blank 1) and 3.3 M sodium hydroxide solution alone
(Blank 2) were also subjected to the protocol described in Method 4. The blank samples
did not yield crystalline solids indicating that the crystals obtained from the sample was
not sodium sulfate or sodium hydroxide. The purity of the base hydrosylate was checked

using RP-HPLC-PDA.

Kupchann fractions), isolate and reference standards indicate that ail of the test samples
and standards have different inhibition activities against mammalian glucosidase (p<0.05,
a=0.05). On the other hand, there were no statistical differences between the inhibitory
activity of isolate and all reference standards at all concentrations which indicates that they
exert the same activity (p>0.05, a=0.05).

Addition of ferric chloride-potassium ferricyanide to the isolate solution resulted to

The fraction F was recovered from eiution of 50:50 methanol: water had the highest
inhibition at 100 ppm concentration followed by fraction G (recovered after the elution of
white bands) and C (recovered from 100% ethy! acetate). The assay results signify that
after purifying the crude extract, the bioactivity stili remain the same. An ICso of 1.955
ppm (4PL), 1.898 ppm (SPL), 1.479 ppm (4PL) and 1.446 ppm (SPL) were the calculated

values for crude extract and fraction F respectively.


Kruskal-wallis test displayed that there were a statistical differences in inhibiting
the mammalian glucosidase between ail test groups and all concentrations (p<0.05,
a=0.05). Mann-Whitnney “u” test demonstrated that there were no difference between the
inhibition (p>0.05, a=0.05 see appendix for detailed p values).

Diverse types of metabolite were monitored in the coluran chromatography
fractions using TLC-Bioautography (Table 8). Qualitative screening of fractions suggested
the presence of polyphenols such as tannin and flavonoid in all fractions while steroidal
compound was detected in Fractions A to D only. Also, indole containing compound was

noted in Fractions A to D. Coumarins which chemically known as 2H-1-benzopyran-2-one


(consist of fused benzene and a-pyrone rings) was detected in Fractions B and C. In
Fraction A and C, the presence of anthrones was observed. On the other hand, low
molecular weight lipophilic compound (Steroid) in Fractions A to E were present. A
positive result in vanillin-sulfuric acid verified the presence of phenolic and steroidal
compounds and indicates the probable presence of higher alcohols and essential oils.
Sugar was also noted in Fraction A to D and absence of cardenolides, alkaloids,
anthraquinones and peptides in all fractions.

The phytochemical investigations of column chromatography fractions of
Melothria sp. indicated the presence of pharmacologically useful classes of compounds.
Coumarin was reported to possesses anticoagulant, antibacterial, neuroprotective,
anticonvulsant, anutubercular, antioxidant and antihyperglycemic activities. Example of
coumarin compound with antihyperglycmic activity is Fraxidin (Venugopola K.N.,
Rashmi, V. and Odhav, B.,2013). Anthrones is an unstable compound that tend to exist as
dianthrones which is rnore stable. This occurs when a piant containing an anthrone
compound is dried. These compound was reportec to exert laxative activity by stimulation
of the peristalsis and inhibition of water and electrolyte absorption by the gut (Aldred,
E.M.,2009). Steroids such as f-sitosterol was identified using GC-MS analysis in
Terminalia catappa frutts exhibited the highest binding energy and inhibition constant
against S. cerevisiae glucosidase (Sari et. al., 2016). The result describe the plausible
activity of plant steroidal compound in inhibiting the glucosidase. Carbohydrate-based
glucosidase inhibitor like acarbose (psuedotetrasaccharide, iminosugar) remains as the

clinically used drug and gold standard in comparing the new dug candidates. Aside


controlling the post prandial glucose Ivel in DM2, iminosugars like Miglustat (Zavesca®)
is approved by FDA in 2003 in Type 1 gaucher disease (Lyosomal storage disorder)
(Rahman., A.U., 2016).

Purification of fraction C using column chromatography.

Although the analysis of Fraction F resulted to 77.18% at 100 ppm inhibition of
mammalian a-glucosidase activity in vitro, the presence of abundant and common natural
product such as condensed tannin was the only metabolites detected present in the fraction
and additional purification may lead to a high false positive result due to non-specific
enzyme precipitation of the compound (Beutler, A., 2009). Due to relative high sample
yield (Table 9) of Fraction C (3 highest inhibitor at 100 ppm 34.68% inhibition) in
comparison to Fraction G (2™ highest inhibitor with 46.32% inhibition, recovered from
50:50 methanol: water and the sample yield was 2 mg only) and presence of different
phytoconstituents (flavonoid, steroid, sugar, indoles, coumarin and tannin) made the
researcher to purify the sample using another round of flash chromatography.

extract as starting material.


Nine (9) subfractions from fraction C were pooled together using TLC analysis.
The mammalian glucosidase inhibitory activity of these subfractions are reported in table

Mann Whitney “U” test of subfractions Cl to C9 against the reference standards
revealed that all test samples were statistically the same as acarbose, epicatechin, ellagic
acid. tannic acid and coumaric acid in inhibiting the mammalian glucosidase in all
concentrations (p>0.05, a=0.05). The % inhibition of Fraction C and its subfractions C1
to C9, were not statistically different in all concentrations which indicates that they have

the same ability to inhibit the enzyme (p>0.05, a=0.05).


The greater than 40% inhibition against mammalian glucosidase of subfractions
Cl, C2 and C8 can be attributed to the presence to their common constituents, the
polyphenols such as tannins and flavonoids. However, there are other phytoconstituents
detected (essential oil from Cl, triterpene and sterol from C2 and C8. Anthraquinone was
also noted in C8) and supplementary purification must be performed to rule out the active
compound responsible for the inhibitory effect. Because the purification of Fraction C did
not improve the inhibition towards mammalian a-glucosidase, Fraction F (condensed
tannin containing sample) was considered for another purification using modified
Kupchann method.

Modified Kupchann was conducted to semi-purified condensed tannin from
Fraction F due to applicability of the method for purification of non-polar (lipids and
chlorophyll), moderate to polar constituents such as sugars (Otsuka, H., 2005). The
redissolved fraction F was partitioned thrice with equal amounts of n-hexane, chloroform
and ethyl acetate, concentrated using rotavap (aqueous fraction was lyophilized) and re-
assayed.

Table 12 summarizes the inhibition of different fractions obtained from modified
Kupchann Only the fraction of aqueous fraction and ethyl acetate have an above 50%
inhibition with calculated ICso of 1.89 (4PL), 1.739 (SPL), 1.94 (4PL) and 1.739 (SPL)
respectively.

Mann Whitney test revealed that there were no statistical differences between the
mammalian glucosidase inhibition of modified Kupchann fractions and all reference
standards at 10, 20 and 100 ppm (p>0.05, a=0.05).

Due to high inhibition of aqueous fraction at 100 ppm, the sample was first screened
for the presence of condensed tannin using FeCl3-K3Fe(CN)6. A dark green solution was
observed indicating that condensed tannin was still present in the sample. To remove the
tannin from the other components, alkaline alcoholic precipitation was employed.

The mechanism behind the alkaline alcohol precipitation is the conversion of free
poly phenols to sodium polyphenolate (Figure XX) . The presence of sodium hydroxide
resulted in lower phenolic compound recovery which probably turned into salts which
precipitate in the mixture of ethanol and water due to low solubility (Gong, X., Li Y. and
Qu H.,2014). Although the method is not selective and specific for tannin removals, the
method was still performed due to practical application of the procedure to the plant sample
and availability of the materials needed for this study. After performing the alkaline
precipitation method to the aqueous fraction, a clear supernatant liquid was filtered from

the samples, evaporated and subjected to enzyme assay. The results are shown in Table 13.

differences between the mammalian glucosidase inhibition of supernatant from alcoholic
precipitation and reference standards at all concentrations (p>0.05, a=0.05). This implies
that the bioactivity of the recovered sample was the same as all the reference standards.
Treatment of supernatant with ferric chloride-potassium ferricyanide solution
revealed that alkaline alcoholic precipitation was able to remove the tannins. However, the
purification of supertanant sample was terminated due to decrease in inhibition from
71.45% (aqueous fraction from modified Kupchann) to 60.45% at 100ppm and calculated
ICso increased from 1.89 to 1.994 (4PL) and 1.739 to 1.932 (SPL). The decreased in

bioactivity can be pointed to the loss of condensed tannin which may be accountable to

ihe mammalian glucosidase inhibitory property of the sample being purified.

Purification of crude extract by method 2

Based from method 1, condensed tannin is one of the metabolite detected at all
active semi-purified samples (Fraction F and aqueous fraction of modified Kupchann).
This method utilized alkaline alcoholic precipitation of crude extract. After subjecting the
sample to tannin removal protocol, the collected supernatant was evaporated to dryness
and a mixture of black resin and yellow-green crystals (Figure XXII) were recovered and
manually separated by scraping. The initial mammalian glucosidase assay denoted that the
resinous matter (Figure XXIV) had higher inhibition (57.88%) compared to crystalline
sample (Figure XXIII) (43.88%) at 100 ppm Thus, the resin was purified again using flash

chromatography

The bioactivity increase after purifying the resinous matter was purified using

column chromatography. The highest inhibition at 100 ppm was noted in fraction H with
calculated ICso of 1.378 (4PL) and 1.365 (SPL). A greater than 59% inhibition was

calculated in fractions G, I, J, K, L and M.


Kruskal wallis test proves that there were statistical differences among all test
samples (resin, crystals and Column chromatography fractions A to M) and all reference
standards (p<0.05, a=0.05). Using Mann-Whitney test proves that at all concentrations (10
ppm, 20 ppm and 100 ppm) the mammalian glucosidase inhibition of all samples were not
significantly different from all reference standards (p>0.05, a=0.05).

Although the fractions exhibited good inhibitory activity into mammalian
glucosidase, the isolation protocol (method 2) was also discontinued due to low recoveries

of each fractions for purification (see appendix for % yield).

Purification of sample by method 3

Recently, cross-linked aqueous insoluble N-vinyl-2- pyrrolidone polymer (PVP)
is used in binding of phenolic compounds such as tannins from aqueous solution. The
binding of phenols to the polymer by hydrogen bond formation, pH of solution and on the
substituents (functional group) present in the phenol. Because hydrogen bonding was more
likely to occur in water than in ethanol (organic solvent) system, the crude extract was
dissolved in water with the aid of continuous stirring and sonication until all sample was
completely in solution (Andersen R.A. and Sowers, J.A., 1967). After recovering the
supernatant from PVP treated aqueous crude extract, the sample was freeze-dried,
subjected to modified kupchann for another purification and re-assayed Results of the
enzyme inhibition assay of the isolates from method 3 are presented in table 15.

An increase by 10.85% inhibition activity was calculated after removing the tannin
from unrefined extract and additional purification of the test samples resulted to 91.42%
mhibition using modified kupchann aqueous fraction. The calculated ICso of PVP treated
crude and modified kupchann aqueous fraction were 1.738 (4PL), 1.637 (SPL), 1.654 (4PL)
and 1.557(SPL) respectively. Mann-Whitney test demonstrates that there were no
statistical differences between the reference standards and samples (crude extract treated
with PVP and fractions from modified Kupchann) at all concentrations (p>0.05, a=0.05).

Additional separation technique was performed to the aqueous fraction from
modified Kupchann using solid phase extraction (SPE). After loading the dissolved sample
into the SPE cartridges, 2 bands (light yellow and brown bands) were retained in the
stationary phase (Figure XXVI). To recover the compounds from the cartridge, another 45
ml of pure water was used followed by 20:80 (Figure XXVII) and 50:50 acetone: water

(Figure XXVIID).

The brown band started to elute with 50:50 acetone: water while the light yellow
band was eluted using 80:20 acetone:water (Figure XXIX). To completely recover the
samples in stationary phase, pure acetone (Figure XXX) was flushed as the mobile phase.
The experiment yielded 6 fractions which were freeze-dried to concentrate for enzymatic

assay.

Table 16 summarizes the mammalian glucosidase inhibition assay The samples
recovered fiom pure water as mobile phase (1*t and 2"4 aquoues elutant) exhibited the
highest glucosidase inhibitory activity with calculated ICso of 1.411 (4PL), 1.376(SPL),
1.57(4PL) and 1.513 (SPL) respectively. Kruskal wallis test implies that all samples from
method 3 (PVP treated crude extract, modified kupchann fractions and SPE fractions) and
reference standards have a significant differences in inhibiting the mammalian glucosidase
at all concentrations (p<0.05, a=0.05). Whereas, the results of Mann Whitney test displays
that the reference standard and SPE fractions have the same inhibition activity to
mammalian glucosidase at all concentrations (p>0.05, a=0.05).

Phytochemical screening for phenolic compound such as tannin was performed on
the 1° and 2" aqueous fractions and confirmed that condensed tannins were still present in
the test them However, Onslow M.W., 2013 reported that ferric chloride also reacts with
anthocyanin (a water-soluble pigments from vascular plants, Castaneda-Ovando, A., et. al.,
2009) to formed a brown or green solution. The qualitative test assumes the presence of

“
condensed tannin or anthocyanin but further study must be performed to characterize the
metabolite identity in both SPE aqueous fractions. Regardless of the good inhibitory etfect
of SPE aqueous fractions (1* and 2°4 ) to mammalian glucosidase, the purification was

terminated due to low samples recovery (see appendix for % yield).

Instrumental analysis of isolate.

The selection of test samples for HPLC-RP-PDA analysis was decided based on the
inhibition activity to mammalian glucosidase and amount of the test sample available for
instrumental and enzyme kinetics analysis (see percentage yield of all methods at the
appendix).

From Table 18, the kinetics of acarbose analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis
(Km from 0.803604 to 0.924815 and Vimax from 0.0001483 to 0.000107) indicated that it
was a competitive inhibitor as stated from other published literature. In addition, the isolate
displayed a competitive inhibition as described by increased in Km from 0.353089 to

0.922601 and relatively unchanged Vmax. Competitive inhibitor like acarbose


(psuedotetrarasaccharide) resemble the substrate and occupies the catalytic site, the
inhibitor prevents normal substrates from binding and being catalyzed (Sharma, R., 2012).
The Melothria sp, (Piti-pipino) crude extract had mixed type inhibition of mammalian
alpha-glucosidase explained by increased in Km from 0.803 to 0.925 relatively unchanged
Vmax. The semi-purified condensed tannins (Fraction F) exhibited mixed type inhibition
and reduction in Vmax from 1.257491365 to 0.000102 and Km from 0.0000705069 to
0.000017313. Mixed type inhibition of mammalian glucosidase was also discovered in
Melothria sp. crude extract treated with PVP (Vmax from 0.0000970874 to 0.0000313018
and Km from 1.557475728 te 0.3359612 } and SPE 1* aqueous fraction (Vmax from
0.0000534731 to 0.0000157848 and Km from 2.213892305 to 0.013255462). Mixed type
inhibitor does not have structural similarity to the substrate but it binds both of the free
enzymes and the enzymes-substate complex. However, it alters the enzyme conformation
and reduces the catalytic activity due to modification of native catalytic groups at the active

site (Sharma, R., 2012).


CHAPTER V
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Conclusion

The present study investigated the purification and isolation of potential active
compound from Melothria sp. (Piri-pipino) leaves and stem crude extract (Family:
Cucurbitaceae) with mammalian alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effect. Previous report from
preliminary screening of selected plant materials from Siba-o, Calabanga, Camarines Sur
showed that Melothria sp. (Piri-pipino) had the strongest inhibition activity (72.24% at 100
ppm) ainong 98 samples and from the collected piant material last October 2016, the study
was able confirmed the bioactivity (78.22% at 100 ppm) of crude extract. The developed
isolation method (Method 4, 0.009% yield from starting material of 22.1 g crude extract
and 2% recovery rate from 100 mg aqueous modified Kupchann fraction ) which utilized
alkaline hydrolysis of condensed tannin was able to purify a compound with retention time
of 33.98 min and the purity was verified through 9 point purity index (upward and
dewnward slope index: 0.999, threshold 1.00) using reverse phase (C18)-HPLC
hyphenated with photodiode array detector. The statistical analysis of crude extract, semi-
purified samples (from all isolation methods), isolate and reference standards (tannic acid,
ellagic acid. epicatechin, o-coumaric acid and acarbose) revealed that there were no
statistical difference in inhibiting the mammalian a-glucosidase at all concentrations (10,

20 and 100 ppm) used in the assay (a=0.05).


Lineweaver-Bruk plot analysis of isolate displayed a competitive inhibition while
the crude extract and semi-purified samples (Fraction F, PVP treated crude extract and SPE
1" aqueous frac'zon) exhibited a mixed type inhibition against mammalian alpha-
glucosidase.

Recommendations:

Bioassay-guided isolation was a tedious process that must carefuliy plan and
executed. In this study, challenge such as the insufficient amount of semi-purified and
isolated compound was inevitable. In the future, the following activities are recommended
to further expand the potential of Melothria sp. (Piri-pipino) as a new source of alpha-
glucosidase inhibitor:

1. Analyze the mammalian alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity of other plant
parts of Piri-pipino such as the roots and fruit (unripe and ripe) to properly
document the potential of the plant sample as glucosidase inhibitor;

2. Examine the nutritional value of ripe fruit of Piri-pipino to prove the safety of
the sample for consumption;

3. Quantitate the condensed tannin content of crude extract and the recovered
samples using vanillin-butanol assay from polyvinylpyrrolidone treatment and
alkaline alcoholic precipitation to determine the efficiency of both methods in
rernoving the tannin;

4. To scale-up the extraction, purification of crude extract and further develop
Isolation Method 2 due to high inhibitory effect of Fraction H and 1 (above

80% at 100 ppm);


11.

To purify the rat intestine acetone powder using ammonium sulfate
fractionation followed by size exclusion chromatography and quantitate the
activity of each glucosidase complex (lactase, sucrose, maltase and isomaltase);
To optimize the parameters of alkaline hydrolysis such as base concentration
(molarity), temperature and time for alkaline hydrolysis of Melothria sp (Pin-
pipino) condensed tannins;

To characterize the structure of the isolate using instrumental analysis such
HPLC-MS/MS (molecular weight of unknown and fragmentation pattern),
FTIR (functional group) and 1D and 2D-NMR;

To perform molecular docking analysis to the molecule of the isolate to
characterize the interaction between the functional group of compound and
enzyme’s active sites;

To establish the safety and toxicity profiles of crude extract, semi-purified
samples and isolate tniough cytotoxicity assay (in vitro) and LDso analysis (in

vivo);

. To detarmine the species of Melothria sp. using traditional voucher specimen

preparation coupled with DNA barcoding and;
To cultivate Melothria sp. (Piri-pipino) to increase the plant sample supply for
another researcher interested in continuing this study and/or perfonning

different bioassay.
