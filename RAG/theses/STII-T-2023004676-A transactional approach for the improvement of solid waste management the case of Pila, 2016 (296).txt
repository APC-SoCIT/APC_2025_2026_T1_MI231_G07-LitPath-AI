ABSTRACT

A transactional approach was employed to explore the underlying reasons
behind the current solid waste management practices of the municipality of Pila.
As representatives for the upland, urban, and lakeshore communities,
respondents from Pansol, Sta. Clara Sur, Pinagbayanan were surveyed. Also, a
KII and secondary data analysis were done. It was found that majority of the respondents declared that they practice
segregation, 3Rs, and are refraining from burning waste. However, some are still
not practicing proper management. Also, their waste disposal practices vary
Consequently, the respondents are knowledgeable on proper waste
Management and laws; and have positive attitude towards proper waste
management. Moreover, it was observed that the history of land use and solid
waste ordinances affect the respondents’ practices. The different landscapes of
Pila, its residential and municipal waste facilities, in connection with their
practices, were also identified. Therefore, their practices can be explained through the interplay of
psychological processes, physical environment, and temporal qualities. By
understanding these relationships, strategies were formulated to aid the
municipality towards an improved solid waste management. In general,
recommendations address issues on the knowledge and attitude of the
respondents, the improvement of their physical setting, and enactment or amendment of municipal ordinances.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

The environment, in general, serves three fundamental functions. The
environment provides resources necessary for life, is a repository of wastes, and
is a living space (Dunlap and Marshall, 2006). However, based on functional
competition, if the environment is fully used to serve a singular function, this will
then impair its ability to serve its other functions (Dunlap, 2003). Dunlap (2003)
pointed out that there exists a conflict between environment's functions
especially with waste repository and living space. Moreover, waste has a major
effect on the quality of natural resources that the environment provides. Thus, the
growing number of wastes has to be addressed in order to strike a balance
among these three main functions.

Issues on proper solid waste management arise in response to the
growing need to address accumulation of waste. Globally, waste crisis started
alongside industrial revolution when people favored instant and disposable
products (Barles, 2014). In addition, waste increased and was aggravated due to
the growing population (IPCC, 2007). According to the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (2007), in recent years, rate of waste generation have been
increasing especially in developing countries like the Philippines. This can be

attributed to the rapid population growth, economic development, and

urbanization of these countries. Based on the recent studies of Worldbank (2012,
2013), urban solid waste is projected to increase by 70% by 2025. Developing
countries are more likely to carry the burden of waste crisis unless population
growth is addressed, waste reduction efforts are initiated, and consumption
patterns are changed.

Solid waste problem poses risks on both the environment and human
health. One of the most common effects of improper waste disposal is flooding
(Djihad, 1990 as cited by Zoleta-Nantes, 2000). Waste, usually plastics, clogs
drainages and waterways which led to massive flooding especially in urban areas
(Zoleta-Nantes, 2000; UN-HABITAT, 2010; Navarro, 2014). In the Philippines,
typhoons like Sendong and Ondoy were exacerbated due to flooding caused by
trash (Legarda, 2012). Also, waste finds its way to bodies of water and leach in
the soil thus contaminating and compromising the health of both. According to
Carr and Neary (2008) dumping of municipal solid waste in lakes and rivers
ultimately lead to its eutrophication. Aside from this, open dump yards
contaminate groundwater and surface water making it unsuitable for drinking
(Rajkumar, Subramani, & Elango, 2010). Open burning leads to the emission of
carbon dioxide among others and one of the key drivers of climate change
(Weidinmyer, 2014). Furthermore, it pollutes the air, including ashes and debris,
which poses health risks once inhaled (Cuna, 2012). Moreover, landfills, through
decomposition, also emit greenhouse gases, like methane, which is one of the

major contributors to global warming (Tammemagi, 1999). In addition, improper

waste disposal can lead to health risks and loss of lives. Improper waste
disposal, such as direct dumping in waterways and rivers, causes epidemics like
the Black Death in England which took the lives of a quarter of its population
(Tammemagi, 1999). In the Philippines, the 150-feet Payatas dumpsite, due to its
unstable nature along with two incessant typhoons that year, collapsed and took
the lives of hundreds of people (Pagano, 2000; EcoWaste Coalition, 2012)
Various laws were enacted to address issues on solid waste, though not
directly, given the magnitude of its effects and contribution to climate change
(United Nations Environmental Programme, 2009). Moreover, according to
United Nations Environmental Programme (2009), the Philippines is one of the
countries that have stringent environmental laws. In the country, the Ecological
Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 or Republic Act 9003 was promulgated in
order to address these issues with solid waste. The main objectives of the law
are to provide ecological solid waste management program, to create necessary
institutional mechanisms and incentives, to declare certain prohibited acts and
provide penalties, and to appropriate fund to serve its purpose. By implementing
the law, the local government units (LGU, Local Government Code, 1991) were
also tasked to formulate their local ordinances to further strengthen the RA 9003.
Few of these are the banning of the use of plastic bags as implemented in
different municipalities and fostered with campaigns like the Bring Your Own Bag
campaign in Los Bafios Laguna (Los Bafios Municipal Ordinance No. 2008-752;

Basilio, delos Reyes, and Santos, 2016). Another common ordinances are the

prohibition of open burning of wastes as exemplified by the municipality of Pavia,
lloilo (Pavia Municipal Ordinance No. 2015 - 03) and waste segragation and
collection policies like that of Cebu City (Cebu City Ordinance No. 1361).

According Huffman and colleagues (2014), solid waste management,
specifically recycling, is one of simplest form of Environmentally Responsible
Behavior. However, despite of these laws and regulations, compliance with solid
waste management is low (Balisacan, 2013). According to Lizaba (2012), one
important factor that affects compliance is the social aspect aside from the
physical characteristics of the area, administrative, and economic aspect. RA
9003 specifically mentioned that waste generators have to be encouraged to
cooperate in the solid waste management program and self-regulate their solid
waste management practices. Nonetheless, in order to attain compliance, it
indeed entails actual behavior change (Hass, 2015). Moreover, prior to behavior
change is understanding individuals and reason behind their current actions
(Communication for Governance & Accountability Program, n.d.).

One of the promising approaches to explain human behavior, in this case
‘solid waste management, is by understanding behavior's relationship with the
environment through the transactional worldview (Altman and Rogoff, 1987).
According to Altman and Rogoff (1987), transactional world view is a
Psychological world view which tries to describe and understand patterns in an
event or behavior by analyzing its aspects as holistic entities or as a whole.

These aspects include the people, their psychological processes, the physical

environment, and temporal qualities. Based on the study of Werner (2003), the
transactional world view was employed in order to formulate behavior change

programs.

Statement of the Problem

Pila or Pailah Laguna is one of the oldest civilizations in the Philippines.
Its rich history dates back during the Tang Dynasty in 900 A.D. Historically
significant artifacts were unearthed in one of its barangays. With these, the
municipality was recognized as a National Historical Landmark in 2000.
Moreover, in 2002, the San Antonio de Padua Parish Church of Pila, the first
Antonine Church in the Philippines, was proclaimed by the Roman Catholic of
San Pablo as a Diocesan Shrine of St. Anthony. Pila is the only town in the
country which is recognized by the church and the state as a historical site
(Santiago,1997).

Aside from being a historical site, it is also one of the municipalities that
prominently line Laguna de Bay. Based on the accounts of elders, there was a
time that the municipality became totally submerged in water due to weather
calamity. This incident made the Spanish colonization of Pila difficult, thus, the
town was called Bayang Pinagpala (Santiago, 1997)

Currently, Pila is classified as a third class municipality (Pila Laguna

Municipal Profile, 2007). Third class municipalities are those that have average

total revenue of 35 million or more but less than 45 million pesos per annum
(Department of Finance, 2008 as cited by the Philippines Statistics Authority,
n.d.). In spite of being one of the laggard municipalities of Laguna, Pila is
experiencing a trend in residential development since 2002 thus increasing the
population to approximately forty-eight thousand. Moreover, the Philippines’
urbanization trend is taking a southward move towards CALABARZON Region
which includes Laguna (Asian Development Bank, 2014).

Increase in population of Pila would also mean an increase in the number
of waste generated. Currently, Pila is considered a rural municipality which
generates an estimated 0.4 kilograms of waste per capita per day. However, the
increase in population and establishments, or urbanization, in the area could lead
to the increase of waste generation of 1.1 kilograms per day (Worldbank as cited
by Del Barrio, 2015). It is imperative that the municipality address their current
waste problem especially that the municipality is a flood prone area. The LGU of
Pila, in compliance with RA 9003, already has a ten-year Solid Waste
Management Plan as well as ordinances to support the law. However, difficulty is
experienced in the implementation of the law. One of the reasons is that the
people are not fully complying with the ordinances, as iterated by the LGU.
Based on the study of Lizaba (2010), Barangay-level compliance of Pila Laguna
is low. However, underlying reasons for this non-compliance is not yet well

explored. Understanding the reasons behind the constituents’ current solid waste

management practices is necessary for the formulation of an effective solid

waste management program tailor-fitted for the municipality of Pila.

Research Questions

Promoting an effective solid waste management in Pila Laguna was
attained by understanding the underlying reasons for the current solid waste
management practices of its constituents. This was guided by the following
research questions:

1. What is the current solid waste management practices of Pila

constituents?

2. What is the current Knowledge, Attitude, and Perception of Pila

constituents regarding solid waste and its management?

3. What are the available solid management facilities in Pila Laguna?

4. How does the landscape (upland, poblacion, and lakeshore) of Pila

Laguna differ from one another?
5. Whats the history of Pila Laguna?

6. What is the history of the solid waste management of Pila Laguna?

Objectives of the Study

The study aimed to promote effective Solid Waste Management in Pila,
Laguna. Specifically, it aimed to:
1. Describe their current solid waste management practices;
2. Understand the underlying reasons for the constituents’ current solid
waste management practices through transactional analysis by:
a. Identifying their knowledge and attitude toward solid waste and
its management;
b. Describing individual's physical setting; and
c. Identifying the temporal qualities that affects solid waste
management

3. Formulate strategies to further improve Solid Waste Management in

the municipality.

Significance of the Study

At present, environmental degradation is a global crisis. Seeing the
magnitude of its impacts, policy makers are adamant in creating laws and policy
that can at least protect and conserve what is left of the environment. One of the
biggest contributors on its degradation is the increase and improper waste
disposal. To address this, the Philippines enacted R.A. 9003. However, in all
phases of a project or law, the social aspect is almost always neglected. In Pila,
Laguna, LGU is currently implementing solid waste management schemes
including banning the use of plastics and prohibiting open burning. However,
barangay-level compliance is still considered low (Lizaba, 2012).

The study focuses on the social aspect of solid waste management by
understanding underlying reasons for the current solid waste management
Practices and root causes of non-compliance. The study also tests the use of
transactional approach, which views events and behavior holistically, to identify
and understand patterns on solid waste management behavior. Several studies
have been done to identify the knowledge, attitude, and practices of people
fegarding solid waste management. However, this study would like to
comprehensively describe and understand the solid waste management
Practices of Pila constituents.

After identifying patterns and understanding the current solid waste

management practices with the guidance of transactional worldview, the study


aims to formulate effective solid waste management strategies tailor-fitted for
Pila, Laguna. Also, the study can aid policy makers and the local government of
Pila to identify gaps that hinder compliance on solid waste management as well
as strategize ways on how to increase it.

The study contributes to the existing researches on solid waste and its
management focusing on social understanding. Also, the study adds to
researches in the field of Environmental Psychology through the use of

transactional approach.

Scope and Limitation of the Study

The locale of the study was solely Pila, Laguna considering its three
distinct landscapes - the upland area, urban area, and coastal area. Dividing the
barangays into different landscapes aided in the description and comparison of
the different waste management practices performed in the areas.
Representative barangay from each landscapes was selected based on their
waste generation. Thus, the barangay that generates the most wastes per
landscape was studied. These are Pansol (upland), Sta. Clara Sur (urban), and
Pinagbayanan (coastal). Residents of each barangay were conveniently
sampled.

The study made use of transactional approach to identify and understand

patterns on their solid waste management schemes. However, instead of

aa)

‘studying all of the aspects of transactional worldview, the study only focused on
the respondents’ current solid waste management practices, specifically on
waste segregation, recycling and reusing, burning of waste, and disposal; their
psychological processes, including their knowledge and attitude towards solid
waste management; the physical settings; such as the different landscapes,
residential, and municipal waste facilities; and Pila’s historical background i.e.
history of land use and previous ordinances on solid waste. This was done
through surveys, key informant interviews, and use of secondary data.

Findings employed qualitative analysis through the identification of
patterns on behavior and narratives. The study only used minimal statistical
measures (e.g. frequency count and percentages) to facilitate discussion.
Moreover, the study was only limited to formulating strategies on solid waste
management based on the findings from the transactional analysis.
Implementation of suggested strategies to promote solid waste management was

not be covered by the study.

CHAPTER Il

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

Solid Waste

History and Definition

Major issues on solid waste may have arose only during the Industrial
Revolution, however problems on waste can be traced back to the prehistoric
days (Barles, 2014). Moreover, description of waste changes along with time.
During the Pre-historic era, waste includes bones, seeds, fruit peels, and the like
when humans are still considered nomads. When humans began to settle, waste
turn into scrap cotton cloths, pieces of woods, broken pots, and ashes. While
from 5000 A.D. to 12000 A.D., metal pieces, plastics, chemicals, and infectious
substances are also considered as wastes. From 12000 A.D. to present, waste
then includes radioactive substances, hazardous substances, junk electronic
equipment aside from the previously mentioned materials (Chandrappa, R. &
Das, D.B., 2012)

Solid waste is defined differently, but generally, it is anything that is
unwanted or damaged thus easily discarded (Cambridge English Dictionary,

Oxford Dictionary). Also, it is something which is cheaper to throw away than to


store or reuse. Waste is synonymous to scrap, junk, garbage, or rubbish
(Merriam-Webster Dictionary). According to Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata (2012),
wastes are mere “by-products of a consumer-based lifestyle that generally drive

the world economy”.

Factors Affecting Solid Waste Generation

There are several factors that affects the amount and characteristics of
waste found in a certain area. One of which, according to Hoornweg and Bhada-
Tata (2012), is urbanization and income. According to Worldbank (as cited by Del
Barrio, 2015), higher income residents generates waste of 1.1 to 5 kilograms of
waste per capita per day as compared to lower income residents with 0.4 to 0.6
kilograms of waste per capita per day. Higher income residents usually have the
habit of use-and-throw while those who belong in the lower income commonly
use-and re-use. Other factors include population growth, increase in the number
of manufacturing industries, and technological advancement and modernization.

A growth in population would also mean an increase in solid waste since
it is inevitable that everyone creates waste (Dahiya, 2015). According to
Worldbank (2013), solid waste generated will triple in 2100 along with the global
urban population. Increase with the number of manufacturing industries will also
contribute to the amount and characteristics of waste created. This is coupled

with the quality of goods produced and the efficiency of process being utilized.


Furthermore, the more technologically advance or industrialized a country is, the
more waste it produces (Hoornweg, Bhada-Tata, & Kennedy, 2013). It also give
rise to new form of waste like the electronic waste or e-waste (Gaidajis,

Angelakoglou, & Aktsoglou, 2010).

Municipal Solid Waste Generation

Solid waste is commonly divided into four categories. These are
municipal, industrial, agricultural and animal waste, and hazardous wastes.
Municipal solid waste includes waste from residential, commercial and
institutional areas, construction and demolition, and those that are from municipal
services. At times, agricultural waste may be included depending of the nature of
the municipality. According to US Environmental Policy Administration (2008 as
cited by Chandrappa & Das, 2012), municipal solid wastes are usually buried,
burned, recycled, or composted. Composition of municipal solid waste varies due
to several factors. These factors include patterns of lifestyle, seasonal variations,
income of the municipality, as well as the commercial establishments present in
the area.

Currently, global solid waste generation levels are at approximately 1.3
Billion tons per year. As shown in Figure 1, almost half or approximately 44% of
these global wastes is generated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation

and Development (OECD) Region including the United States of America,


Canada, Australia, etc. This is then followed by the East Asia and the Pacific
(EAP) Region, including the Philippines, with 22%. However, bulk of the waste
from EAP is generated by China. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)
contributes 12% of waste, Eastern and Central Asia Region, 7%, and Middle
East and North Africa Region (MENA), 6%. The least generators of waste are
from Africa (AFR) and South Asia Region (SAR), both contributing 5% each
(Hoornweg & Bhada-Tata, 2012).

Waste generation level is expected to double to 2.2 Billion tons per year
by the year 2025 and will triple by the year 2100 (Worldbank, 2012). As
projected, In 2000, waste generation level per day will reach 11 million tons

(Worldbank, 2013).

State of the Philippine Solid Waste Management

The Philippines is no exception from other developing countries which,
from the past decade until present, are experiencing major problems in terms of
their waste management. The country’s rapid population growth, urbanization,
and modernization are all significantly contributing to the increase of waste
generated and are exacerbating the issues on its management. According to
Atienza (2011), the Philippine solid waste generation rate ranges between 0.30
and 0.70 kg per capita per day for rural and urban. Based on 2012 data (Ng,
2012), the country is producing 29,315 tons of municipal solid waste and it is
expected to triple by the year 2025 due to projected population growth

(Hoornweg & Bhada-Tata, 2012).

Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000

In response to the growing need to address the country’s solid wastes, the
Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 or R.A. 9003 was enacted in
January 26, 2001. R.A. 9003 emphasizes the importance of the three aspects of

solid waste management — technical, administrative, and social aspect. The main

objectives of the laws are the following (DENR-EMB):

a

b.

Ensure the protection of public health and environment;

Utilize environmentally-sound methods that maximize the
utilization of valuable resources and encourage resources
conservation and recovery;

Set guidelines and targets for solid waste avoidance and volume
reduction through source reduction and waste minimization
measures, including composing, recycling, re-use, recovery, green
charcoal process, and others, before collection, treatment and
disposal in appropriate and environmentally sound solid waste
management facilities in accordance with ecologically sustainable
development principles;

Ensure the proper segregation, collection, transport, storage,
treatment and disposal of solid waste through the formulation and
adoption of the best environmental practices in ecological waste
management excluding incineration;

Promote national research and development programs for

improved solid waste management and resource conservation


techniques, more effective institutional arrangement and
indigenous and improved methods of waste reduction, collection,
separation and recovery;

f. Encourage greater private sector participation in solid waste
management;

g. Retain primary enforcement and responsibility of solid waste
management with local government units while establishing a
cooperative effort among the national government, other local
government units, non-government organizations, and the private
sector;

h. Encourage cooperation and self-regulation among waste

generators through the application of market-based instruments;

Institutionalize public participation in the development and
implementation of national and local integrated, comprehensive
and ecological waste management programs; and
j. Strengthen the integration of ecological solid waste management
and resource conservation and recovery topics into the academic
curricula of formal and non-formal education in order to promote
environmental awareness and action among the citizenry.

According to Atienza (2011), RA 9003 is indeed a stringent and
comprehensive act in addressing solid waste management in the country,
however weak compliance with the law is still evident. Failure of the previous
laws enacted before R.A. 9003 to fully address the solid waste management

issues of the country may be attributed to several reasons. One of which is the


lack of cooperation of the community and various stakeholders due to the
command-and-control nature of the law. Another factor is the lack of political will

of the officials (Atienza, 2011).

Solid Waste Management Researches in the Philippines

Several studies have been done in order to understand the interplay of
factors that are currently affecting the solid waste management of the
Philippines. These include the scrutiny of social factors and_ institutional
arrangements in relation to solid waste management.

The study of Ancog, Archival, and Rebancos (2012), for example, looked
into the efforts of Cebu City, one of the highly urbanized city in the country, in
addressing their municipal solid wastes. It analyzes the three aspects of an
institutional arrangement - the legal, regulatory, and financing mechanisms.
Analyses were done through intensive review of secondary data as well as KIl
interviews of pertinent individuals. The study found, based on the experience of
Cebu City, the success of solid waste management programs rely heavily on
community involvement and is fostered with rigid enforcement schemes.

On the other hand, the study of Tatlong-hari and Jamias (2010), looked
into the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices on solid waste management. The
study was conducted in Sta. Rosa Laguna, one of the urbanizing towns near

Metro Manila. Result of the aforementioned research can be used in developing


extension campaigns strategies to better promote solid waste management in the
area. Moreover, the study's goal is to aid campaign planners in designing
message content, channels and feedback. It was discovered that knowledge
levels on solid waste management in the municipality is high, thus messages
should focus more on sustaining motivation to practice effective solid waste
management.

Similarly, the study of Del Mundo, Rebancos, and Alaira (2009), explored
the socio-economic status, environmental awareness, knowledge, and
perception of the residents of Barangays Talisay and Balibago, Calatagan
Batangas and its correlation to their Solid Waste Management Practices. Based
on the result of the study, the respondents have high environmental knowledge
but have low awareness on the ordinances and laws on proper solid waste
management. These then are the reasons why the residents continue to do
open-burning and open-dumping of garbage. In general, it was found that socio-
economic status and environmental awareness is negatively correlated to solid
waste management practices while environmental knowledge and perception is
Positively correlated with solid waste management practices. With these results,
it can aid the local government of Calatagan in the improvement of their Solid

Waste Management Plan and Coastal Resource Management Plan.


Pila, Laguna Muni

History of the Municipality

The rich history of Pila or Pailah dates back before 1000 A.D. as proven
by archeologists who found ancient potteries, artifacts, and horse bones from the
Tang Dynasty. The municipality, with its ancient culture and trade, was deemed
as a National Historical Landmark since the year 2000 thus, Pila is named as La
Noble Villa de Pila.

Moreover, in 2002, the San Antonio de Padua Parish Church of Pila, the
first Antonine Church in the Philippines, was proclaimed by the Roman Catholic
of San Pablo as a Diocesan Shrine of St. Anthony. According to Dr. Luciano
Santiago (1997) — a Philippine historian, Pila is the only town in the country which
is recognized by both the church and the state as a historical site.

Pila is known by its many names. Even before the Spanish colonization,
the municipality is known as Pagalangan or The Place of Reverence. During the
Spanish colonization, Franciscan missionaries named the municipality Villa de
Pila due to the anthills that lined the site that they visited. However, the
colonization of Pila was made difficult because, according to the elders, the
municipality was once submerged in flood water thus, Pila was called by the

locals as Bayang Pinagpala. |n addition, after the war, several old houses and


the church of Pila was spared from destruction during the Spanish and Japanese

occupation (Pila Laguna Municipal Profile, n.d.).

Physical Description

Belonging in the fourth district of Laguna, Pila lies along the 121 degrees
latitude and 14 degrees latitude approximately 85 kilometers south of Manila.
The municipality is bounded by the Laguna de Bay on the north, the municipality
of Victoria on the west, Liliw on the south, and Sta. Cruz on the east. The
municipality's 3,120 hectares of land is divided into 17 barangays (Table 1).
Generally, Pila has a dominantly level or nearly level topography in terms of it
slope. Its slopes ranges from 2.5 % to 5% with the lowest areas situated in the
coastal barangays and the highest elevation found at the barangays nearing the

municipality of Liliw.

Socio-Economic Description

In terms of land area (Table 1), Barangay Concepcion (439.90 ha) has the
biggest land area. However, based on population, Pinagbayanan is the most
Populated. Indeed, population of the municipality is concentrated in the poblacion
and rural lakeshore barangays (Table 2). Two of the most populated barangays

Of Pila is situated along the coast of Laguna de Bay - Pinagbayanan (5,562) and


Labuin (4,810) while one of the poblacion barangay also made it to the top 3
populated barangays - Sta. Clara Sur (5,507). In terms of population density,
Bulilan Sur has the highest density of 50 persons per hectare in 2013.
Furthermore, population of Pila is expected to increase in the coming years given

the trend from 2007 to 2013 (Table 2).

Pila is one of the municipalities of Laguna which is currently, though
slowly, in the process of urbanization. The once rural town of Pila is experiencing
urban sprawl through the increase in residential trend in the form of private
subdivisions since 2002. Twenty-one subdivisions were created in 2002 alone

and based on the current data of Pila, in 2007, this increased to 27. Currently,


there are four barangays considered as urban zones while the remaining thirteen
are considered rural barangays divided into lakeshore and upland community
(Table 2).

The increase in private subdivisions signifies an increase in the population
of Pila. Population of the municipality is approximately 49,000 in 2013 and will
eventually increase with 2.4% growth rate. Moreover, the municipality may be
considered as a developing one however the poverty incidence in Pila (8.4) is
relatively low as compared to its surrounding towns. Also, the poverty gap is high
with 2.26 as compared with neighboring municipalities (Philippine Statistics
Authority, 2014). This means that some constituents of Pila might belong to
higher income residents.

As a third class municipality, majority of Pila’s income comes from the
agriculture sector. Several commercial establishments can also be found
especially in the poblacion. Furthermore, small scale, cottage-level, and
household-based industries are additional sources of employment for the
municipality's population. Based on the report of Baticados, Natoza, and Sotto
(2015), Pila is one of the agricultural communities of Laguna and is heavily

dependent on rice farming and backyard poultry and hog raising.

Solid Waste Generation

The Municipality's generated waste averages to about 23,168.64
kilograms per day (Pila Laguna Municipal Solid Waste Management Plan, 2013).
Approximately 53% (12,261 kgs/day) of these wastes are residentially generated
while 47.08% (10,907 kgs/day) come from commercial and _ institutional
establishments. Most of these establishments are composed of the 21 local
schools situated in the area. Figure 2 illustrates the waste of Pila in terms of

generators.

Based on the Waste Analysis and Characterization System (WACS)
conducted in 2013, more than half of Pila’s wastes are biodegradable (53% or
12, 335 kgs/day). The remaining 47% is divided to recyclables (22.25% or 5,155
kgs/day) and residual wastes (22.82% or 5,287 kgs/day). Residual wastes
characterized were composed of sando bags, thin films, Polypropylene (candy,
biscuits, and food wrappers), and metallic foils. Moreover, a small portion of
waste is considered as special waste (1.68% or 389 kgs/day) and may be
attributed to the absence of hospitals in the municipality except for Barangay

health centers. Figure 3 shows the waste characterization of the municipality.

In accordance with the RA 9003, the local government of Pila created
ordinances to address issues on its municipal solid waste. As early as 2009, the
LGU is regulating the use of plastics bags. Moreover, in 2014, Pila approved the
ordinance that prohibits outdoor or open burning of wastes. Also, the municipality
of Pila finished their full-blown 10- year solid waste management plan in 2013
and was submitted to the National Solid Waste Management Commission. In
2014, the plan was finally approved and is currently being implemented.

Based on the study of Lizaba (2010), overall compliance of Pila with R.A.
9003 is within the average level. However, in terms of its Barangay level
Compliance Assessment, which focuses more on the social level, the

municipality's average compliance is indeed low.

Transactional Worldview

Overview on Transactional Worldview

Altman and Rogoff (1897 as cited by Werner, Brown, and Altman, 2006)
believed that psychological worldview is a promising psychological approach to
study a phenomena or behavior. Transactional world view functions with three
basic assumptions. First, this world view perceives a phenomenon; with people,

Psychological processes, physical setting, and temporal qualities as a


component; holistically and simultaneously. Second assumption, is the view that
time and temporal qualities actually affect a phenomena or behavior and not as a
separate entity. Lastly, transactional world view is employed to investigate
patterns, shapes, and forms of a phenomenon to better describe and understand
it. Table 3 summarizes the comparison between the usual interactional
worldview, wherein a phenomenon

is studied through cause-and-effect

relationship, and the transactional world view (Altman & Rogoff, 1987 as cited by

Rogoff, 2016)

Accordingly, the four aspects of the transactional worldview - people,
Psychological processes, physical setting, and temporal qualities - are all
interconnected (Werner, Brown, and Altman, 2002). Moreover, they all have a
mutual relationship and are inseparable from one another. The extent of these
aspects and what is required to be studied depends on the phenomena or event.
When considering these aspects, there are wide and complex array of factors
that can be included in the study. Succeeding discussion look into the possible
factors that could be included in the study of aspects under the transactional

analysis.


Aspects of Transactional Worldview

A. Social Milieu

According to the study of Huffman et a/. (2014), social influence plays a
significant role in the prediction of environmentally responsible behavior.
However, this factor only encourages external Perceived Locust of Causality
(PLOC) thus affecting self-reported behavior. People having an external PLOC
are usually motivated by the desire to appear socially responsible, caused by
social influence, thus encouraging them to self-report such behavior. Based on
the result of the study, there is indeed a strong relationship between social
influence and self-reported environmentally responsible behavior. Those with

higher social influence are more likely to acknowledge self-reported behavior.

B. Psychological Processes

Climate change is indeed one of the pressing issues that need to be
addressed immediately. According to Green and Schafer (2003), in order to
further reduce the global GHG emission, behavioral measures need to be taken
into account. Moreover, according to Oskamp (2002 as cited by Bonnes &
Bonaiuto, 2002), immediate change in lifestyle and cultural practices is

imperative to reduce the degradation of the environment.


According to Huffman et a/. (2014), individual action can create impacts on
a larger environmental problem. Thus, it is important to understand what
motivates an individual to do certain action or behavior. Based on the Self-
determination Theory, motivated behavior lies in a continuum of intentional
regulation called the (PLOC as shown in Figure 4). This continuum ranges from
autonomous to controlled wherein autonomously motivated behavior is

considered as long-term and persistent.

Extrinsic Motivation ( varying degree of
self- determination)

[Binutasedst|

Figure 4. Perceived Locust of Causality.

The study of Huffman et a/. (2014) which centered on predicting recycling
behavior put emphasis on PLOC. PLOC is divided into two parts namely: the

intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. It has five constructs, four of which belongs in


the extrinsic motivation (Figure 4). Huffman et al. (2014) explained PLOC by

relating it to recycling behavior. The following are the five constructs:

a.

b.

Intrinsic Motivation — people recycle because they enjoy doing it
Integrated Regulation — people recycle because it aligns with their
belief system

Identified Regulation — people recycle because they wanted to achieve
a goal

Introjected regulation — people recycle because they don't want to feel
guilty or ashamed

External Regulation ~ people recycle because they don't want to be

penalized through laws and policies

Usually, compliance with environmental laws follows external regulation.

This may be the reason why their behaviors do not last long. As aforementioned

studies emphasize, there is a need to improve people's behavior and be

intrinsically motivated.

According to Lizaba (2010), social factors that affects compliance with

solid waste management is shown in Figure 5. Social diversity includes culture,

level of education, and income class. Lizaba (2010) mentioned that these social

diversity influences a person's behavior specifically discipline and environmental

apathy. These factors then affect cooperation


Figure 5. Social Factors that affects compliance with solid
waste management adapted from Lizaba (2010).

In contrast with social influence, the personal world view of a person
affects more than just their self-reported behavior. World view, specifically
anthropocentrism or the view that humans are the most important part of the
environment, is more related with observed or actual environmentally responsible
behavior. This is because world view is rooted in a deeper belief system which

represents intrinsically motivated PLOC.

C. Physical Environment

Several studies use place attachment to predict environmentally
responsible behavior. However, most of these studies are concentrated on
recreational areas like the study of Eder and Arnberger (2012) wherein they
studied the influence of place attachment on the depreciative behavior of an

urban national park. Local studies also used the concept of sense of place for the


relocation or evacuation of hazard-prone community (Lamug, Crittenden, &
Nelson, 1999). Sense of place is subdivided into three concepts — place identity,
place attachment, and place dependence. Place identity, according to Jorgensen
and Steadman (2001), is a cognitive relationship between a person and the
environment, for instance, a person's role in the community. Place attachment,
according to William and Vaske (2013, as cited by Eder & Arnberger, 2012), is an
affective bond between people and a specific place. Lastly, place dependence,
according to Schumaker (1981 as cited by Jorgensen & Steadman, 2001), is a
conative bond of people, as occupants, with the environment to achieve a certain
goal. People with higher sense of place are more likely to exhibit greater
environmental concern. Moreover, they are likely supporting government efforts

and practicing environmentally responsible behavior.

Application of transactional worldview

Though transactional worldview is a promising approach to understand a
phenomenon, especially through its holistic view on things. Wemer, Brown, and
Altman (2002) mentioned that a researcher cannot in fact exhaust everything in a
transactional study. Depending on the project or research, it may be possible that
only a specific feature or features of the transactional worldview will be
highlighted. At times it is indeed necessary to limit the scope or aspects of the

Study to be able to achieve a sound result or conclusion (Werner, Brown, &


Altman, 2002). Moreover, a transactional research project does not always
require the use of participants, psychological processes, places, time and depth
At some level, all these aspects have to be included though not emphasized
(Wemer, Brown, & Altman, 2002).

Various environmental psychologists make use of transactional approach
to study phenomena like courtship and marriage (Altman et a/., 1992 as cited by
Werner, Brown, & Altman, 2002), the Christmas Street (Altman et a/., 1987), or
the use of front porches.

Altman et al. (1987), using the transactional approach, studied the
Christmas Street in the United States where the neighborhood maintains a 40-
year old tradition of decorating the entire street for the Christmas celebration.
The study found that the people that interact often with their neighbors are more
likely to have the most appealing Christmas decorations. Moreover, these people
are also the ones who have a positive attitude towards the tradition. This study
illustrates the conformity of the participants, their psychological processes, their
social context, and the physical environment. The researchers, during the
conduct of the study, used multiple methodological instruments and procedure to
better apply the transactional approach. They made use of ocular observations
and extensive questionnaires as well as photographs to analyze and understand
the Christmas Street tradition.

Contrary with the Christmas Street study, which uses the four aspects of

transactional worldview, the study on front porches by Brown, Burton, and


Sweaney (1998 as cited by Wemer, Brown, & Altman, 2002) focused only on the
psychological processes and social actors involved in the use of porches. The
study discovered that the porches encouraged friendly interactions among
neighbors which use their front porch as well as interactions with the passersby.
Moreover, the front porches serve different purposes depending on the users. It
became a private area for some, an area for socialization, a place to appreciate
nature, and a place to do various leisurely activities. The research is indeed an
example of a study using a transactional analysis by limiting the aspects
involved

Another study attempted to change environmental behaviors through the
use of transactional approach (Werner, Brown, & Altman, 2002). Transactional
worldview guided the project in creating a program called “No More Chemical
Dependent Homes’ which discourages homeowners from using toxic household
products (Werner & Adams, 2001). The project view homes as a holistic entity
composed of people, setting, time, and psychological process. Therefore, the
locale of the study is situated in the individual homes of the respondents.
Moreover, the study assumes that the attitude of an individual is influenced by
their social group thus the program made use of group discussions in order to
elicit behavior change. Another assumption of the study is that behaviors are
related to an individual physical environment. Hence, persuasive messages were
formulated in order to emphasize positive phenomenal experiences related with

subscribing to non-toxic household products. Time and temporal qualities also


guided the study by developing a program that would encourage a long-term
effect (Wemer, 2002). This study also made use of various strategies to collect
pertinent information (Wemer, Brown, & Altman, 2002). Focus group discussions
were initiated as well as preliminary presentation and key participants interview,
and were supplemented with questionnaires and interviews. With this, the
program is considered open-ended and evolving until its final form (Werner,
Brown, & Altman, 2002).

Werner, Brown, and Altman (2002) preferred the use of a transactional
worldview due to myriad reasons and advantages. First, transactional worldview
expands an individual’s understanding of the complexity of phenomena. Second,
the researchers believed that the application of this worldview is not only limited
to psychologists but is also of use to a non-psychologist audience like architects
and planners. Thus, they “find it useful to describe and understand complexities
of everyday experiences”. Third, certain problems and phenomena require
holistic analyses. According to Werner (1990 as cited by Werner, Brown, &
Altman, 2002), in order to create a long-term impact, the use of holistic and
multilevel intervention is imperative. Lastly, there are considerable untapped
potential in the transactional worldview. Consequently, the researchers are
hoping that through their researches, it may encourage other scholars from
different disciplines to think, discuss, and create researches along these lines

(Altman et a/., 1987).

Theoretical Framework

Transactional approach formulated by Altman and Rogoff (1987) is the

framework of this study. Transactional worldview is composed of several aspects

(Figure 6). These aspects are to be scrutinized and understood simultaneously

and holistically in order to better explain a behavior or an event.

TEMPORAL QUALITIES

PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCE:
PEOPLE
BEHAVIOR/

EVENT

Figure 6. Framework of Transactional worldview
adapted from Altman and Rogoff (1987).


The aspects of transactional worldview are as follows:

People - composed of social participants and social milieu. Social
Participants are people whose actions and mental processes are the
primary target of the study while social milieu are people around the
participants who have relevance to them.

Psychological Processes - complex array of human actions, emotional
and affective experiences, cognitions, and the enactment of and
response to social and cultural rules, norms, and so on.

Physical Environment - complex and can involve a wide variety of levels
of scale, from objects in a home, to rooms, the home itself, the
neighborhood, city, and beyond.

Temporal Qualities - understand different phases of phenomena and how

they unfold; includes time as part of the phenomena.


Conceptual Framework

In order to understand the underlying reasons for the current solid waste
management practices of Pila Laguna constituents, the study uses a framework
adapted from transactional worldview approach (Figure 7). Possible causes of
their current solid waste management scheme was explored by describing and
establishing patterns through scrutiny of the social participants their
psychological processes, the physical environment, and temporal qualities
involved. Findings facilitated formulation of strategies tailor-fitted for Pila Laguna

constituents in order to better promote solid waste management.

For the purpose of this study, the aspects were limited to and focused only
‘on the following:

Psychological Processes — include the knowledge and attitude on solid
waste and solid waste management.

Physical Environment - include the distinct landscape of Pila Laguna
(upland, urban, and coastal), the residential waste facilities of the
respondents, community waste facilities and establishments, as
well as law and ordinances encompassing solid waste
management of the municipality.

Temporal Qualities - considered the history of Pila’s land use, and the

history of solid waste management through past local ordinances.

CHAPTER Ill

METHODOLOGY

Location of Study Site

Geographically, the town of Pila lies within the 121° 122’ latitude and 14°
14° longitude. Pila is one of the municipalities that lined the Laguna de Bay
(Figure 8). Moreover, Pila, Laguna has three distinct landscape - the rural
upland, the urban area, and the rural lakeshore. For the purpose of this research,
representative of each landscapes were selected as study sites. These are
Barangay Pansol for rural upland, Barangay Sta. Clara Sur for urban area, and
Barangay Pinagbayanan for rural lakeshore (Figure 8). These barangays are the
highest waste generators from their respective landscapes (Table 4). Pansol
generates 1,472.78 kilograms of waste per day; Sta. Clara Sur creates 1,218.74

while Pinagbayanan produces 3,196.48.

Data Collection Procedure

Preliminary data were gathered in preparation for the actual study. These

came from the municipal office and barangay offices through face-to-face

interviews and secondary data.

To describe the current solid waste management of Pila Laguna

constituents, primary data regarding the current solid waste management


practices of Pila Laguna constituents were gathered through self- administered

survey.

In order to understand the underlying reasons for Pila constituents’

current solid waste management practices, the following objectives were

‘Satisfied through the following data collection procedure:

1. Identifying knowledge, attitude, perception toward solid waste and its
management.
Respondents’ knowledge and attitude regarding solid waste and its
management were explored through the use of survey. The researcher,
together with Barangay Health Workers (BHW), conducted the survey

through individual house visits to satisfy the objective of the study

ny

Describing individual's physical setting.

Individuals physical setting comes in many forms. For the purpose of this
study, it was composed of three aspects. First is the distinct landscapes
of Pila, Laguna. This was described through transect line observation
from the upland barangay (Pansol), to poblacion (Sta. Clara Sur), to
lakeshore barangay (Pinagbayanan). Second is the residential and
municipal waste facilities which were identified through direct
observations as well as secondary data from the municipal office. Lastly,
the current law and ordinances being implemented in the municipality.
Information about these were obtained through Key Informant Interviews

(Kil) and secondary data from the municipal office.


4. Identify the temporal qualities that affect solid waste management
Temporal qualities included in the study are the municipality's land use
history and its solid waste management history through previous SWM
ordinances. To identify the following, a Kil was done as well as the use
of secondary data available in the municipal office.

The formulation of strategies to further improve solid waste
management in the municipality depended on the result of the previous
objective. Patterns were identified and understood in order to recommend
effective solid waste management strategies.

‘Survey for barangay Pansol was scheduled on September 5 to September

9, 2016. For Barangay Sta. Clara Sur, survey was conducted on September 26

to September 29, 2016 while survey for Barangay Pinagbayanan was conducted

on the previous week of September 19 to 23, 2016. Surveys were done from 9

o'clock in the morning to 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the scheduled dates.

Secondary data gathering and KIl interviews were conducted in the month
of October, 2016 while observations are done from the month of September to

October. Transect mapping was done in morning of September 15, 2016.


Selection of Respondents

Representatives from the three identified barangays of Pila Laguna -
Pansol, Sta Clara Sur, and Pinagbayanan - were selected by the accompanying
Barangay Health Workers per barangay. Respondents were selected based on
their availability during the conduct of the survey. Nonetheless, respondents were
as widespread among the puroks of each barangay as possible. For the KI,
participants include officer-in-charge of the solid waste management of the entire
municipality of Pila, including the Municipal Environment and Natural Resources
Office (MENRO) and Municipal Planning and Development Office (MPDO), as
well as the barangay chairmen of the three barangays or heads of their solid

waste management.

Sampling Method Used

The barangays identified in the study was purposively picked by the
fesearcher for the reason that these barangays have the highest waste
generation based on their respective distinct landscapes (rural-upland, urban,
and rural-lakeshore). Consequently, Pansol, Sta. Clara Sur, and Pinagbayanan
can significantly represent their respective landscapes.

For the survey respondents from each barangay, acceptable sample size

was computed using the online sample size calculator of the Creative Research


Systems. Sample size was calculated at 95% confidence level and margin of
error of 10%. However, due to time and resources constraints, total sample size

from 281 was reduced to 210 (Table 5).

Moreover, convenient sampling was employed as the researcher was
assisted by BHW from each barangay. The BHW selected the respondents
nonetheless, it was ensured that respondents are scattered among the puroks of

each barangays.


Research Instruments

For the survey, the study used a structured questionnaire (Appendix 1).
Questions were focused on the respondents’ solid waste management practices
and their psychological processes including their knowledge, attitude, and
perception about solid waste and its management. To record information during
Key Informant Interview (Appendix 4), a recorder and camera was used.

Since on-site observation is required to explore the physical environment,
specifically the community landscape, municipal waste facilities, and residential
waste facilities, of the social participants, a point-and-shoot camera and journal

notebook was used to record findings.

Data Analysis

The study is a qualitative-type research thus; findings were presented
descriptively. It also applied minimal descriptive statistics through the frequency
count and percentages calculation. Moreover, results were analyzed through the
identification and understanding of patterns regarding the constituents’ current

solid waste practices.

CHAPTER V

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Aspects of Transactional Analysis

Transactional approach guided this study to better understand the
underlying reasons behind the current solid waste management practices of the
constituents from the municipality of Pila, Laguna. Aspects explored include the
psychological process of the respondents, specifically their knowledge and
perception on solid waste and its management. Moreover, the physical
environment, including the landscapes, waste facilities, and ordinances on solid
waste, was observed in the study. Lastly, the temporal qualities affecting SWM,
such as the municipal history and history of SWM ordinances, were also studied.
These aspects are then discussed in the succeeding sections.

Detailed survey results for individual barangays of Pansol, Sta. Clara Sur,
and Pinagbayanan is discussed in Appendix 2. As summarized from Appendix
Table 1, 12, and 23, surveyed population are mostly female comprising 74% of
the total respondents. They are commonly married (82%) with two to three
children (41%) or four to nine children (30%). Most of the respondents’ age
varies from 31 to 60 years old (69%) and almost half of them are housewives

who are high school (33%) or college graduates (25%).


Current Solid Waste Management Practices

Solid waste management practices of the respondents from Barangay
Pansol, Sta. Clara Sur, Pinagbayanan were consolidated as a macro scale
representative of the municipality. Their current solid waste management
practices include waste segregation, practice of 3Rs, incineration of waste, and

waste collection

A. Waste segregation

As shown in Table 6, majority of the respondents are segregating their
waste (93.33%). Moreover, the remaining 6.67% declared that they are not
sorting their waste because they do not have time to cater to their waste
(28.57%). Also, some rather bury alll their waste in their backyard (28.57%).

Those who sort their waste do so because they can exchange recyclable
waste for cash or heaps of salt (25%). Some of them also mentioned that
collection of waste would be easier if wastes are segregated accordingly
(24.48%). Moreover, segregating waste will ensure the cleanliness of the
surroundings, according to some (13.78%) while others segregate to follow the
municipal ordinance (10.20%). As claimed by some, there is a law on
segregation of waste in the municipality.

Those who segregate their waste usually sort them into non-

biodegradable and biodegradable (61.73%) while some segregate them into


biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and others (11.22%). Moreover, some
categorize their waste into non-biodegradable, biodegradable, and recycle. Plate
1 shows how one of the residents of Pila segregates their waste. One of the
respondents puts her biodegradable, like rambutan peelings, in sacks; her non-
biodegradable, usually residual plastic wrappers in plastic bags; and her

recyciable, like papers, in cardboard boxes.

B. Recycling and reusing

Most of the respondents declared that they are recycling or reusing their
waste (76.56%) while the remaining 23.44% are not practicing recycling and
reusing (Table 7). Majority of those who do not recycle or reuse their waste
mentioned that they rather sell their waste to junk shops (73.33%).

On the other hand, those who recycle do so to make use of the utmost
benefit of their waste (43.75%). Most of them are also recycling to exchange
recyclable for money or salt (31.25%). While the aforementioned respondents
believe that they are recycling by selling their waste to junkshops, some
respondents do not consider this are recycling thus they declare that they are not
Tecycling (73.33%). With this, it can be inferred that most of the respondents
have little knowledge on recycling. Thus, only a few of them are knowledgeable

‘on the different ways of recycling their trash.


As seen in Plate 2, one of the respondents is creating home decorations
out of scrap snack wrappers by rolling them into beads. However, she is one of
those who declared that she is not recycling. Indeed, some of the respondents

are still unfamiliar with the concept of recycling.

Most of the respondents recycle or reuse plastic bottles (78.13%) and
plastic bags (50.62%). Some of the respondents also recycle or reuse metals
and tin cans (28.13%). Paper (20%) and boxes (22.5%) are also recycled or

reused by some of the respondents.

C. Burning of waste

As shown in Table 8, one third of the respondents burn their waste

(33.01%) while the remaining two thirds stated that they do not burn their waste

(66.99%). The main reason why most of the respondents do not burn their waste

is because, according to them, it is prohibited to burn waste. Some also said that

it is bad for the health (25%) as well as the environment (23.39%). Moreover, a

Portion of the respondents also said that their wastes are being collected thus

there is no need to burn them (17.74%).

Those who burn their waste usually burn leaves (91.22%) and paper

(33.33%). However, some also burn plastics (28.07%) and candy or snack

wrappers (7.02%). As seen in Plate 3, some residents burn their trash, mostly

dried leaves and plant cuttings with some candy or snack wrappers. The mound


of burned waste is located in a public space along a local road. Indeed, some of
the residents still burn their waste even though an ordinance prohibiting open
burning of waste is being implemented in the municipality since 2014.

Reasons for incinerating waste vary among the respondents. Most of them
mentioned that they burn because this could reduce their garbage ready for
collection. Some also burn because according to them the smoke will encourage
the growth or flowering of plants (19.60%) and that the smoke will drive away
insects like mosquitoes (15.69%). Moreover, a few said that waste are irregularly
collected (15.67%), so instead of waiting for their waste to pile up they opt to

burn them.

D. Waste disposal

Since most of the respondents do not burn their waste, majority said that
they commonly sell their waste to junkshops (Table 9). Some of the respondents
also bury their waste (12.42%) while a few rather pile them up in their backyards
(6.21%). Most of the respondents also said that they let the garbage collector
pick their waste up (69.57%).

As shown in Plate 4, residential waste, commonly stuffed in sacks and

large plastic bags, are lining municipal roads in time for collection of waste.

Psychological Processes Affecting SWM Practices

Psychological process is one of the aspects of transactional analysis that
deals with the individual's actions, emotional and affective experiences,
cognitions, and the enactment of and response to social and cultural factors. In
this study, the respondents’ knowledge and their attitude towards solid waste

management were explored.


A. Knowledge on solid waste management

The study looked into the knowledge of the respondents on solid waste in
itself as well as their knowledge on national and local laws on solid waste
management.

Proper waste management. Based on the survey, majority of the
respondents thinks that segregating waste (97.13%) and selling them to junk
shops (97.61%) are both proper waste management schemes (Table 10). Also,
most of the respondents consider composting of waste (80.38%) and integrating
ecological SWM in the curricula of formal and non-formal education (78.47%).
Majority of the respondents also mentioned reduction of waste by avoiding
materials that can add up to trash (80.38%) as a proper solid waste management
scheme.

However, some of the respondents listed burning of waste as one of the
Proper schemes for managing solid waste (22.49%). Most of which are coming
from the upland barangay of Pansol (22 out of 47). A few of the respondents
believe that piling of waste in their own backyards is another scheme to properly
manage waste (4.31%). Half came from the rural barangays of Pansol and
Pinagbayanan. The remaining 15.78% said that the use of plastic is also a proper
way of managing waste. This is because, according to them, this depends on the

use of plastics as well as how people would use them.

Improper waste management. When asked about the negative effects of

improper solid waste management, majority of the respondents consider waste

as the source of foul smell (99.04%) as top of the list (Table 11). Most of them

also thinks that it can cause severe flooding and a source of diseases like

leptospirosis, dengue, and diarrhea.

Moreover, majority mentioned that

improperly managed waste can cause wounds and cuts (95.67%). Another

95.67% said that it can cause air, land, and water pollution. The least number of


responses is chemical poisoning. Nonetheless, 92.31% of the respondents

answered that chemical poisoning is another negative effect of improperly

managed solid waste.

Solid waste categories. Table 12 shows the respondents knowledge on

solid waste categories. When asked to categorize dried leaves and plant

cuttings; fruits and vegetables peelings; glassware; leftover food; metals and tin

cans; plastics, sacks, and Styrofoam; and tissue and paper, most of them

categorize fruits and vegetables peelings under biodegradable (99.02%). Majority

of them classify dried leaves and plant cuttings (97.57%), as well as, leftover


food (96.60%) under biodegradable while most of them categorize plastics,
sacks, and Styrofoam (97.57%) under non-biodegradable. Majority also
categorize glassware (93.20%) and metal and tin cans (90.78%) under non-
biodegradable. Moreover, most of the respondents consider tissue and paper as
biodegradable (76.70%) while a significant portion of the respondents classify
them under non-biodegradable (25.24%).

Furthermore, a few of the respondents classify glassware (1.94%) and
metal and tin cans (9.80%) under biodegradable. According to the respondents,
this is because these materials, in time, will crumble into smaller pieces. A few
also categorize dried leaves and plant cuttings (2.43%), fruits and vegetables
peelings (1.94%), and leftover food (6.31%) as non-biodegradable. Based on the
tespondent’s accounts, this is because some serve as food to their pets while
some are burned together with their other waste. This shows that although most
respondents are knowledgeable on the correct classification of waste, there are

‘still some who are confused with it.

Laws on SWM. The respondents were asked about the laws on solid

waste management. More than half of the respondents said that they are

knowledgeable on RA 9003 (54.55%) while the remaining 45.45% mentioned

that they do not know anything about the law (Table 13)

Moreover, majority of the respondents claimed that they are well informed

‘on the municipal ordinances on solid waste management (79.33%). However,


those who mentioned that they know of the municipal ordinances, have diverse
answers. Almost half of the respondents said that one of the ordinances of the
municipality is the segregation of waste (44.51%). Some of them mentioned that
Pila prohibits the use of plastics (33.53%) and open burning of waste (35.36%).
Also, according to some, regular and proper collection of waste is another
ordinance of the municipality (20.12%). Some mentioned the prohibition of
littering (14.63%). In relation to this, a few mentioned that one of the municipal
ordinances is keeping the cleanliness of the surroundings (9.76%), as well as,
the recycling and reusing of waste (2.44%). However, 7.32% vaguely mentioned
RA 9003. Interestingly, not only did the respondents include municipal

ordinances but the municipality's programs related to SWM as well.

A. Attitude towards solid waste management

The perception of the respondents on solid waste management is divided
into five. This includes their perception on segregation, 3Rs, incineration, waste

disposal, and solid waste management in general.


Waste segregation. As shown in Table 14, majority of the respondents
claimed that it is easy to segregate waste into biodegradable and non-
biodegradable (95.69%). The remaining 1.91% disagree because according to
them, they are still adjusting with the new program of the municipality on waste
segregation.

Moreover, most of them believe that through segregation of waste, they
could help in the livelihood of other individuals (97.10%). Majority also
mentioned that it is indeed one’s responsibility to segregate their trash (97.57%).
In conclusion, most of the respondents have positive response towards waste

segregation.

the respondents believe that it is easy to use recyclable materials like bayongs

and the like (70.81%). However, a noteworthy 25.36% find difficulty in using

reusable. Nonetheless, though they experience trouble in using reusable,

majority believe that avoiding the use of disposables can relatively reduce their

waste generation. In general, majority have a positive perception on reducing,

reusing, and recycling of waste (Table 15)

Waste disposal. When asked on waste disposal, majority of the
fespondents believe that it is improper to throw trash anywhere no matter how
small it is (87.92%). However, some thinks it is negligible to throw small trash like
candy wrappers anywhere (9.66%). The respondents were also questioned on
waste collection and almost all believe that the individual residents are
responsible for bringing their trash out in preparation for waste collection

(98.54%). The result was shown in Table 17.

Proper solid waste management schemes. However,

almost half of the

tespondents mentioned that they will follow such schemes if their peers are doing

the same thing as well (43.69%).

Moreover, almost all of the respondents agree that they would be of help

to their community if they abide by the laws provided by the municipality

(99.03%). Half of the respondents also said that they will be motivated to apply


proper management in their solid waste if there are laws on it and corresponding
penalties for violators (48.79%). Consequently, majority of the respondents agree
that it is indeed their responsibility to report and file a case against violators
(71.98%) while a portion rather not express their opinion on telling on their
constituents (24.64%).

Furthermore, majority also believe that their peers would appreciate it if
they would share their knowledge on proper solid waste management (97.10%).
Also, everyone thinks that solid waste is one of the pressing issues that the
municipality should address with great commitment. The respondents’ attitude
towards SWM is almost homogeneous to all the surveyed barangays as shown in
Table 18. In general, the respondents have a positive opinion on solid waste
management. Although, their motivation for practicing solid waste management

differs across individuals.

Physical Environment of Pila, Laguna

Physical environment is another aspect of transactional analysis. For the
purpose of this study, physical environment involves the different landscapes,
upland, urban, and coastal; the residential and municipal waste facilities of the

tespondents; and the SWM ordinances of the municipality.

A. Different landscapes of the municipality

As shown in Figure 9, Pila Laguna is one of the agricultural municipality of
the province that lies within the 121° 122’ latitude and 14° 14' longitude and is 85
kilometers south of Manila. Its agricultural nature was observed during the
transect walk last September 15, 2016 from 8 o'clock to 11 o'clock in the
morning. During the transect walk, barangays of Masico, Pansol, Sta Clara Sur,
Bulilan Norte, and Pinagbayanan were traversed via Pila-Calumpang road,
National Highway, and an unnamed road locally known as the boulevard or
Bulusukan road.

Masico is one of the upland barangays of Pila. Its elevation reaches up to
70.3 meters above sea level. Due to its hilly nature, land in the area is usually
used as an agro-forest for fruit bearing trees like coconut, rambutan, banana, and
santol. Aside from being forested and being a plantation area, Masico also have

Patches of grassland area including bamboos. The barangay houses upland farm


animals like horses and goats. Masico is also considered as a residential area
with a population of 2,359 (Municipal Profile, 2013).

Similarly, Pansol is also considered as a rural upland barangay of the
municipality. It is elevated up to 60.5 meters above sea level. Being one of the
agricultural areas of Pila, expanse of rice fields is found in the barangay.
Agricultural animals like horses, ducks, pigs, cows, water buffalos are commonly
raised in the area. Fruit bearing trees like mango, rambutan, chico, and banana
area also grown in the barangay. Moreover, Pansol is considered as a residential
area with a population of 2,563 (Municipal Profile, 2013)

On the other hand, Santa Clara Sur is considered as one of the urban
barangay of Pila and is one of the barangays comprising the Poblacion, elevated
to 50.1 meters above sea level. Being an urban barangay, Santa Clara Sur is
mostly paved where commercial establishments like sari-sari stores, bakeries,
pharmacies, and convenient stores are situated. Moreover, institutional facilities
like schools, barangay halls and churches lined the said barangay. Aside from
the commercial and institutional facilities, Santa Clara Sur also is considered as a
residential area housing a population of 5,507 (Municipal Profile, 2013).
Domestic animals like dogs and cats are commonly observed in the barangay.

Bulilan Norte is also one of the barangays considered as part of the
Poblacion with an elevation of 45 meters above sea level. It is mainly used as a
residential area for a population of 2,301 (Municipal Profile, 2013) and as an

agricultural area. Rice fields lined parts of the barangay with some fruit bearing


trees like rambutan and bananas. Patches of grassland is also observed in the
areas with occasional bamboo grass. Domestic animals are normally found in the
area as well as grassland dwellers like butterflies and dragonflies.

One of the rural lakeshore barangays of the municipality is Pinagbayanan.
It is one of the lowest parts of Pila with an elevation of 44 meters above sea
level. Pinagbayanan is commonly used as an agricultural site for raising ducks.
As a lakeshore barangay, residents fish along the coast of Laguna lake.
Moreover, tracts of land are used for plantation of vegetables like bitter gourds
and tomatoes. Pinagbayanan also houses a population of 5,562 (Municipal

Profile, 2013).

Flow of Goods and Waste. Pila, Laguna exemplify a typical ridge-to-reef
community from the upland community of Pansol and Masico to the lakeshore
barangay of Pinagbayanan. Most of the agricultural produce of the municipality
comes from the upland barangays and agricultural lakeshore barangays. Most
these produce are brought to the municipal poblacion and neighboring towns
where they are usually sold. Some of the vegetables grown in the plantations of
Pinagbayanan are also being transported and put on sale in Divisoria.

Indeed, the flow of goods in Pila is from the agricultural barangays toward
the urban barangays. Nonetheless, since most of the barangays are residential in
nature, the goods then are distributed among all of the other barangays of the

municipality. Once these goods are consumed, what remains become waste.


Thus, waste also accumulates in most of the barangays of Pila in varying
degrees. When wastes are finally collected, they are then brought back to one of
the upland community of the municipality where the MRF is located, in Barangay
San Miguel. Some wastes, especially recyclables, also find their way in junk
shops that pepper the town.

However, mismanaged waste remains as litters in one’s backyard or in
public lands and roads. Some are also carried to Laguna de Bay through the

irrigation system and the Bulusukan river that traverse the municipality.

Findings. Based on the result of the survey, those living in the upland
barangay closely resemble the solid waste management of the respondents from
the lakeshore barangays. However, the solid waste management of those from
the urban barangays are slightly different from those of the respondents from the
other two. For one, more respondents from barangay Pansol and Pinagbayanan
are burning their waste, especially leaves and paper, as compared to those from
Sta. Clara Sur. This may be attributed to the agricultural nature of the two
barangays. Residences in the Pansol and Pinagbayanan have larger backyard
where litter fall usually accumulate; while the residences of Sta. Clara Sur have
smaller areas and are more congested thereby limiting them from burning their

waste.

B. Solid waste management facilities

Residential waste facilities. Residential waste facilities of the
respondents of Pila are usually sacks (96.27%). Given that the municipality is an
agricultural one, sacks are commonly sold in the area and are widely available
for everyone. According to accounts of some of the residents, some of them
recycles sacks, like those from cements and rice, while some bought new ones
for ten pesos each. Some, moreover, uses large plastic bags (23.60%), trash
cans (16.77%), and even recycled plastic containers. A few uses cardboard
boxes as waste disposal facility. Some of the respondents also uses wells, dug

out from the soil, as receptacles for their wastes (Plate 5).

Municipal waste facilities. Generated municipal waste of Pila, Laguna is
currently at 23,168.64 kilograms per day or approximately 0.45 kilograms per
capita per day. Current waste generation of the municipality is within the range of
rural municipalities or low income communities which ranges at 0.4 kg/capita/day
to 0.6 kg/capita/day. However, as previously discussed, the municipality is slowly
urbanizing thus, waste generation may increase to 1.1 to 5 kilograms per capita
per day. Figure 10 illustrates the projection of waste generation of Pila based on
a 2.4% growth rate. As shown, if the municipality remains rural, waste generation
constantly and gradually increase. However, if Pila becomes an urban center,
starting 2016, waste generation will double than the projected waste generated if
the municipality stays rural. Thus, this increase in waste generation could

compete with the current functions of the Pila's environment.

To address the current municipal waste, various garbage cans line public
spaces in the municipality of Pila, including the town plaza parallel to the
municipal hall and the church. These trash cans are colored differently each
assigned for the different categories of trash (Plate 6). However, these garbage

cans are unlabeled therefore wastes thrown are still unsegregated

To collect waste, the municipal office has provided mini dump trucks
(Plate 7) that would travel across town and gather segregated waste at a
designated time and day. Table 19 shows the schedule for the collection of waste
on majority of the barangays excluding the agricultural barangays of Bukal,
Concepcion, and Mojon as mentioned by the Head Municipal Engineer, Engr.
Cyrene Pangilinan. However, as seen in the schedule, there is no schedule for

Brgy. San Miguel as well.

Apart from the smaller trucks that individually collect waste from the local

roads of Pila, a bigger ten-wheeler one (Plate 8) is on standby in the MRF to

receive the collected waste. Once full, this dump truck is ready to bring the

accumulated waste to the Sanitary landfill located in Hain Canlubang, Calamba.


Plate 8. Municipal solid waste hauled to the dump truck ready for transport.

As of the moment, Pila has a singular Material Recovery Facility situated
in one of the upland barangays of the municipality - in Barangay San Miguel.
Right after the scheduled collection, segregated wastes are directly brought and
attended to in the MRF. Previously, wastes are collected even though it is
unsorted. Thus, sorters are assigned in the MRF to further segregate waste. At
Present, the current administration ensures that wastes are segregated upon
collection. Hence, after collection, wastes are immediately transferred to a larger

dump truck ready for transfer to the sanitary landfill. However, both


biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes collected are dumped to the same
landfill

The MRF currently houses different equipment, like a bioreactor, plastic
shredders, and facility like the vermicomposting pit (Plate 9). However, these
facilities and equipment are left idle in the MRF. These have been used for some
time after purchase however, markets for shredded plastics is not enough to
compensate for electricity cost used to power the multi shredder. Moreover,
feedstock for bioreactor, which process biodegradable waste, was not sufficient
for its continuous operation. Same goes with the vermicomposting pit wherein
occasional market for the produced fertilizers is inadequate to sustain investment.

cost for vermicomposting.

Findings. As observed the respondents’ current residential waste facility,
indeed, affects their behavior. Some are reluctant to segregate because
according to them they do not have enough trash cans to place their segregated
waste. Therefore, they rather not segregate at all and resorted to other means
like burning their waste or dumping them in their backyards. Some are also
complaining that they routinely buy two sacks every week to act as waste bags
for their non-biodegradable and biodegradable waste which is taking some toll on
their finances. Though they are willing to segregate their waste, unavailability of

proper waste facility is limiting their behavior.


According to accounts of some respondents, garbage trucks seldom
collect their trash thus they opt to burn some of their waste to prevent it from
piling up. The physical characteristics of the some of the barangays also limit the
collection of waste. Usually, places, not included in the collection route, cannot
be reached by the mini dump trucks for the reason that roads are too small to
accommodate vehicles. Also, some individual residences are too far flung that
they rather not segregate for they know that their waste would not be collected.

Moreover, it was observed that the MRF of the municipality only serves as
a transfer station for the municipal waste instead of being utilize to further classify
and divert wastes. Thus, these recovered wastes can serve some other
functional purposes instead of being dumped immediately in the sanitary landfill
Nonetheless, the municipality is currently proposing individual MRF for each
barangays of Pila so as to reduce the wastes to be discarded in the sanitary

landfill. Community bins along the collection area are also being proposed.

C. Solid waste management ordinances and programs

The municipality is currently implementing four local ordinances on solid
waste management. These ordinances address issues on littering and dumping
of waste in public lands. Moreover, ongoing ordinance on the regulation of
plastics is being administered. The prohibition of both open burning of residential

waste and the burning of agricultural wastes is enforced in the municipality.


Municipal Ordinance No. 012-97. This ordinance prohibits littering or
dumping of waste along public roads and places. Moreover, it prohibits burning of
waste along the aforementioned areas. Violators are subjected to fines ranging
from one hundred pesos (100 PhP) for first offense, two hundred (200 PhP) for
second offense, to three hundred (300 PhP) for third offense. Violators may also
be subjected to up to seven days imprisonment.

According to the ordinance, even children who violate the law may be
subjected to corresponding penalties. Parents of the violator will be warned for
first offense. Second offense require a fine of two hundred pesos (200 PhP) while
third offense increases to a three hundred peso (300 PhP) fine and the
submission of the child under the care of DSWD for seven days. The resolution
has not been amended since then. Fines and penalties still apply in the present

year.

Municipal Ordinance No. 01-2009. This resolution addresses the
problem on plastic waste. Under the ordinance, it is prohibited to sell or provide
plastic bags to customers as packaging materials for dry goods. Moreover,
though it regulates the use of plastics on wet goods, the ordinance bans the use
of secondary plastic packaging for wet goods. In addition, it is illegal to use
Styrofoam packaging as containers for food products or any other products.
Plastic waste will remain uncollected unless it is cleaned and dried upon waste

collection


Business establishments or individuals who violate the said ordinance
have to pay fines. For first offense, violators have to pay five hundred pesos (500
Php) while one thousand pesos (1000 PhP) has to be paid for second offenses.
Third offense requires a fine of two thousand five hundred pesos (2500 PhP)
and/or imprisonment of not more than six months depending on the discretion of
the court. Business establishments, however, may be subjected to cancellation of
license for a year.

This is the first and sole ordinance on plastics in the municipality as of the
moment.

Municipal Ordinance No. 03-2011. This ordinance deals with the
agricultural waste of the municipality. Under this, the municipality prohibits the
burning of agricultural waste, specifically rice hulls and hays. Violators of this
ordinance will be warned after first offense. After second offense, they will be
fined with five hundred pesos (500 PhP) per mound of hays. Third offense will be
fined with one thousand five hundred pesos (1500 PhP) per pile or up to six
months of imprisonment.

This ordinance is an amendment of the previous ordinance that prohibits
burning of hays in public lands. However, burning them in private areas may be
permitted. The former state of this ordinance was one of the earliest solid waste

management ordinance in Pila.


Municipal Ordinance No. 01-T-2014. This law is the first ordinance to
totally ban the outdoor or open burning of residential waste thus modifying the
provision provided by Municipal Ordinance No. 012-97. Individuals or
corporations who violate this ordinance will be penalized accordingly. First
offense requires reprimanding of the violators. For the succeeding offenses,
violators will be fined from five hundred (500 PhP) to one thousand five hundred
pesos (1500 PhP) or community service at the MRF for two days or community

service for two days at the barangay and three days at the MRF.

SWM programs. Aside from all the existing ordinances on solid waste,
programs on solid waste management are currently being practiced in the
municipality of Pila. At the beginning of September 2016, the solid waste
management campaign of Pila was started.

Seminars, attended by barangay officials, were conducted as a refresher
course on RA 9003 and local ordinance being implemented in the municipality.
Through this seminar, Barangay Health Workers (BHW) and Day Care Workers,
were briefed on their importance in the success of the campaign on solid waste.
Moreover, they were also encouraged to do house visits for further discussions
‘on the current and future plans of the municipality regarding waste management.

A kick off parade was also held to show the municipality's dedication to
address problems on solid waste. During the march, leaflets were distributed and

Posters on solid waste management were paraded. However, parade was only


done with in the poblacion barangays. On the same day, a covenant signing was
done and pledges from public servants were gathered. Therefore, exemplifying
the municipal campaign slogan: “Tara Na, Sama-sama sa Paglinis ng Basura”
(Come, Together, Let us Clean our Waste).

A garbage collection immersion was also done in accordance to the solid
waste program of the municipality. During the immersion, the currently seated
Mayor himself personally assessed the compliance of the residents on current
ordinances and programs of the municipality. Through the garbage collection
immersion, the municipal leader further asked for the cooperation of the people.

Moreover, the municipality distributed bayongs or weaved bags as
alternative for plastics. This program aimed to encourage residents to refrain
from using plastics bags in support to the Municipal Ordinance No. 01-2009 with
a slogan: “Sa Pila Bawal Ang Plastik” (In Pila, Plastics are Banned).

Other programs related to solid waste management include the clean-up
of the Bulusukan River and public roads spaces through Oplan Linis-llog and
Oplan Simot-Dampot, respectively. Furthermore, an organization called Task
Force Linis -Unlad was created to man programs on the cleanliness of the

municipality.

Findings. \t was found out that even though there are few ordinances on
solid waste, most of the residents of Pila are knowledgeable on the other solid

waste management programs of the municipality, such as the segregation and


collection of waste. Most of them are practicing segregation thinking that this is in
accordance to municipal ordinance. Although, there are still no formal laws on it
yet.

However, the leniency of some ordinances might have been urging some
of the residents to continue inappropriate practices like littering and dumping of
waste anywhere and burning of waste. As observed some areas are still teeming

with waste even with the municipal ordinance prohibiting littering (Plate 10).

Plate 10. Improper waste practices in the municipality of Pila.

Nonetheless, the efforts of the administration to address solid waste are
immensely visible to the residents, thus they are more willing to conform with the

rules and participate in the programs.

Temporal Qualities Affecting Solid Waste Management

To further explain reasons for the current solid waste management
practices of the constituents from Pila, Laguna, temporal qualities were also
studied. These include the history of the municipality's land use and the history of
solid waste management of Pila through their previous ordinances regarding

solid waste.

A. History of municipality’s land use

Pila, Laguna is one of the early civilizations established in the Philippines.
According to historians, the municipality is one of the biggest barangayanic
domains in Southern Luzon during pre-Hispanic times. In 1589, a Datu farmed
the arable lands of Pila and rented them out to nobles and freemen who paid the
leader with sacks of rice as rent. During the Spanish era, part of the municipality
was a hacienda owned by prominent Spanish-Portuguese families. Pila then

remained to be a vast agricultural land.


Presently, Pila continue to be as one of the agricultural municipalities of
Laguna. However, residential developments are starting to spread across the
municipality. Trends in the establishment of residential subdivisions occurred in
early 2002. Based on recent data, the municipality has a total of 26 subdivisions
situated in some of the previous agricultural lands. Nonetheless, 90% of the land
area of Pila is devoted as agricultural land while only 8.01% is considered

residential sites and 1.6% is considered commercial areas.

B. History of the solid waste management

Preliminary to the current solid waste management ordinances of Pila, the
municipal council or the Sangguniang Bayan incepted a few laws on solid waste
tong before the establishment of RA 9003. Out of the many environmental laws
currently recorded in the Sangguniang Bayan, the municipality have ten
ordinances pertaining to solid waste (Appendix 5). Figure 11 illustrates how the

solid waste ordinances of the municipality progresses.

Figure 11. Timeline of the municipality's ordinances on solid waste.

1973. The earliest documentation of solid waste management in the
municipality dates back in the 1973. Municipal Ordinance No. 5 simply prohibits
‘the dumping of broken glass, dilapidated tin cans, and any other waste in any
parts of the road or public lands. Also in the same ordinance, the residents are
allowed to burn any of their waste, even along the roads, as long as there will be
no residue left uncleaned. This ordinance was signed in February 3, 1973 by the

then Mayor Juanito Relova Jr.


Another ordinance on solid waste, specifically agricultural waste, was
signed on April 28, 1973. Municipal Ordinance No. 12 regulates the operation of
rice mills and requires owners to have individual rice hull deposits. Moreover, the
ordinance prohibits the burning of rice hulls in public lands while a permit from

the mayor is necessary before burning them in private properties.

1989. It is after 16 years that an addition to the solid waste management
ordinance of Pila was established. In July 3, 1989, Municipal Ordinance no. 11
was signed by another municipal leader, Mayor Querubin Relova.

This ordinance requires all stores, situated in the public market of Pila, to put up
garbage cans in their storefronts. These cans have to be made of metal, painted
similarly, and have to be lined with plastic bags.

On the same year, another ordinance on solid waste was signed in
October 16, 1989. The ordinance prohibits piling up or dumping of hays along the

roads of the municipality.

1997. After eight years, another ordinance on solid waste was adapted
Municipal ordinance No. 012-97 is an amendment of Municipal ordinance no. 5 in
1973. Similarly, the ordinance prohibits the throwing of shattered glass, shabby
tin cans, and any other trash along the public lands and roads. However,

Municipal ordinance No. 012-97 prohibits the burning of waste along public


roads, whereas the previous one permits buming as long as no trash or residues

will be left behind.

2007. Subsequent to RA 9003, a resolution on the establishment of Plia
Ecological Solid Waste Management Board was created. Seven years after the
founding of RA 9003 in 2000, Resolution No. 042-T-2007 was approved in
November 19, 2007 by the then Mayor Wilfredo Quiat. The objectives, duties,

and functions of the board is listed in Appendix 5.

2009. Two years after, another ordinance was created to address one of
the solid waste issues, not only in Pila, but in the entire country - plastic waste.
Resolution No. 034-S-2009 was signed in April 28, 2009. It was created to
regulate the use of plastic bags in wet goods and to prohibit its use in dry goods.
The use of Styrofoam was also prohibited under this law. Moreover, the law
states that plastic wastes will not be collected unless cleaned and dried prior to

submission

2011. In February 14, 2011, the municipality prohibits the burning of hays
altogether, regardless of where it will be burned. The previous state of the
ordinance on hays and rice hulls permits burning only if it is burned in private
lands and permits were secured. Prohibition of burning agricultural waste was

‘strengthened through the Municipal Ordinance No. 03-2011 signed by the Mayor


Edgardo Ramos. According to the resolution, burning is prohibited because the
act depletes the nutrients present in the soil. Moreover, agricultural waste, when

buried and allowed to decompose, will make soil fertile.

2014. Fourteen years after RA 9003, the municipality created an
ordinance solely for the incineration of waste. In April 7, 2014, Municipal
Ordinance No. 01-T-2014 was approved by Mayor Wilfredo Quiat. The resolution
ultimately prohibits outdoor or open burning of waste for the reason that today’s
trash like plastic, metals and synthetic materials contains harmful compounds.
Once burned, this waste can cause diseases like respiratory ailments and
probably cancer. Aside from plastics and synthetic materials, the ordinance also

prohibits burning of leaves and paper for this can also cause pollution,

Findings. Based on the recorded ordinances of the municipality, the
history of solid waste management in Pila could have had affected their current
solid waste management practices. For one, apart from RA 9003, local
ordinances on Reduce, Reuse, Recycle (3Rs) and segregation of waste are still
not enacted in Pila Laguna. Nonetheless, massive campaigns on these practices
are currently being introduced by the present administration. This may be the
Teason why some of the respondents surveyed claimed that they are not
practicing this management yet. The respondents are still adjusting with the

current municipal programs.


Moreover, a portion of the respondents are still burning their waste for the
reason that the ordinance on open burning was recently incepted - 2 years ago.
As documented in the 1973 ordinance, the residents of Pila are burning their
waste and were still allowed to burn them along highways. In 1997 though,
constituents were not allowed to burn along main roads and public lands but can
bum their waste on private spaces away from local roads. Burning of waste,
usually leaves and papers, is the residents practice since the early days. For
years, most of the residents are burning or grew up burning their waste. Thus,
burning persists even after the establishment of Resolution No. 028-T-2014.
Nonetheless, the current administration is determined in changing the residents’
burning of waste behavior.

In addition, littering along public lands and roads are widely known by the
residents of Pila. This is because as early as 1973, the people were instructed to
tefrain from dumping waste like broken glass, dilapidated tin cans, and any other
waste that can compromise the cleanliness of the municipality.

Moreover, the municipality instructed business owners to setup trash cans to
properly manage litters. However, this is limited only in public markets.

As observed, most of the ordinances of the municipality is concentrated on
agricultural waste. This is attributed to the agricultural nature of Pila, Laguna.
However, current trash of the municipality includes commercial wastes, like
plastics and the likes, other than agricultural waste. Thus, there is a need to

address the current characteristics of waste present in the municipality.


Moreover, the years of interval among the solid waste management laws, could
have indeed negatively reinforced the residents’ solid waste management

practices

Understanding Solid Waste Management

Through Transactional Analysis

To better understand the current solid waste management practices of the
residents from Pila, a transactional approach, proposed by Altman and Rogoff
(1987) guided the study. Through the transactional worldview, aspects including
psychological processes, physical environment, and temporal qualities, were
explored. Based on the transactional approach, the study did not aim to apply all
of these aspects in understanding behavior. Nevertheless, it tried to identify
patterns through these aspects to further explain the solid waste management
practices of the constituents. Thus, explanation for the practices, segregation,

3Rs, incineration, and disposal, may vary depending on the identified patterns.


Segregation of Solid Waste

Psychological processes. As noted, segregation practices of the
fespondents are very high. Indeed, most of them declared that they are
segregating their waste (see Table 6). Their segregation is affected by several
factors. For one, their attitude on sorting of waste is highly positive. They think
that it easy to sort waste into different categories (i.e. biodegradable and non-
biodegradable), and that through segregation they could be of help to an
individual's livelihood. Moreover, they believe that it is their responsibility to
segregate their waste. Therefore, these are influencing their segregation practice
(see Table 14).

The respondents’ knowledge on segregation may also have affected their
segregation practice. Majority of them believe that segregation is one of the
proper solid waste management schemes as cited in Table 10. Also, most of the
respondents think that segregating waste have benefits on them, some of which
is that it prevents flooding and diseases, and that they could earn cash through
segregating recyclables (Table 6). Thus, they are motivated to sort their waste.
With this positive knowledge, their perception or attitude then becomes positive
towards segregation. Both of these psychological processes affect one another.
Thus, they are motivated to segregate their waste.

However, it was also observed that some of the respondents wrongly

classify their waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable (Table 12). When


those who wrongly classified their biodegradable waste is summed up, 12% of
the respondents are indeed mistaken. Moreover, 36% incorrectly categorize their

non-biodegradable.

Physical environment. The physical environment also affects the
respondents’ segregation practice. Specifically, the current programs of the
municipality on waste segregation encouraged the residents to practice waste
segregation. Even without a formal ordinance on segregation, majority of the
respondents still segregate their waste. The municipality's persistent campaign
on waste segregation might have affected their knowledge and attitude towards
the segregation of waste.

The different landscapes of the municipality, however, do not have much
bearing on their segregation. The segregation practices of the respondents
across landscapes are almost the same. As shown in Table 6, most of the
respondents from Pansol, Sta. Clara Sur, and Pinagbayanan are segregating
their waste. Nonetheless, the respondents’ residential waste facilities affect their
segregation. Some declared that they fail to segregate their waste because they
do not have enough trash cans. The municipal waste facilities are also affecting
segregation of waste. Since wastes are being collected at a specific day and
time, the respondents are motivated to segregate them for convenient waste
collection. This municipal waste service in turn affects the individuals’ knowledge

and attitude towards solid waste management.


Patterns on the temporal qualities, such as the history of land use and
ordinances on SWM, and its relation to the segregation were not observed.
Nonetheless, the researcher does not discredit that there might be a connection
between temporal qualities and their segregation of waste like the categories of
waste generated in the past and how it pars with the present. However, these

have not been included in this study but may be included for further researches.

Reducing, Recycling, and Reusing of Waste

Psychological processes. Majority of the respondents claimed that they
are recycling or reusing their waste while one fourth of them said that they are
not (see Table 7). Their practice on 3Rs is affected by their psychological
processes. The respondents’ attitude towards 3Rs garnered almost three fourths
positive response that it is easy to use reusable materials while the remaining
‘one fourth finds it inconvenient. Some also perceived that it is better to discard
recyclable waste. With this perception, some rather not recycle or reuse their
waste (see Table 18).

Nonetheless, majority of the respondents thinks that reducing waste being
generated is another proper waste management scheme. Thus, majority are
Practicing 3Rs. Moreover, their perceived benefits of recycling or reducing waste
encourage the respondents to do so. The most common motivation is that they

can exchange recyclables for money. However, this reason is stated by both


declared recyclers and non-recyclers (see Table 17). With this, it was inferred

that the respondents have little knowledge on 3Rs.

Physical environment. In terms of physical environment, it was observed
that there is no major difference on 3Rs practice among the different landscapes
of the municipality. As shown in Table 7, most of the respondents from Pansol,
Sta. Clara Sur, and Pinagbayanan are recycling or reusing their waste.
Nonetheless, it was observed that the municipality, through their waste
management program, encourages the residents to practice 3Rs even without
the existence of formal ordinance on reduce, reuse, and recycle. This programs,
could have affected their knowledge and attitude towards 3Rs.

Individual waste facilities and municipal waste facilities also do not affect
3Rs. Nonetheless, the presence of junk shops in the area has motivated the
respondents to recycle their waste.

Moreover, connection between 3Rs and the history of land use as well as
previous ordinances on solid waste was not observed in this study. Like that of
waste segregation, the previous categories of waste being generated by the
municipality could have affected their recycling and reusing practices. However,

this was not included in this study but can be of future use to other studies.


Incineration of Waste

Psychological processes. Most of the respondents do not incinerate
their waste however, one third of the respondents claim that they still burn their
waste (see Table 10). These practices could have been affected by their
knowledge on burning waste. Some of the respondents consider burning of
waste as one of the proper waste management scheme (see Table 10). Also,
their perceived benefits from burning waste, like the flowering of plants or the
fleeing of insects, affect their practice (see Table 8). Nonetheless, majority of the
respondents believe that they should refrain burning any kind of trash. However,
this is still outweighed by the circumstances presented to them thus resulting to

continuous incineration of waste.

Physical environment. \ndeed, the physical setting has an effect on the
incineration practice of the respondents. As previously discussed, most of the
respondents burning their waste are from the upland barangay of Pansol (see
Table 8). The nature of its surroundings, as well as the wide backyard spaces,
motivated the residents to burn. Moreover, the municipal waste facilities
constrain their choices. As mentioned, people continuously burn because their
garbage remains uncollected. Some of the areas, especially far flung ones, are
not included in the collection route. Nonetheless, there is a current ordinance on

burning of waste that is limiting the residents from burning. Most of those who

113,

refrain from burning mentioned that they do so because they chose to abide by
the law.

With this, it can be concluded that the physical setting is affecting the
knowledge and attitude of the residents therefore their incineration practice as

well.

Temporal qualities. One of the significant aspects affecting waste
incineration is the temporal qualities of Pila, Laguna. Based on the history of the
municipal land use, Pila is highly agricultural. Wastes generated are commonly
agricultural waste and back in the days, this type of waste can be burned.
Indeed, burning can be traced back on the early days of Pila Laguna. Even the
previous ordinances can attest to that. As mentioned in the previous section,
residents of Pila were allowed to burn their waste even in public lands. Then the
said law was amended prohibiting them to incinerate waste in public lands
though they can still burn in their private spaces. It was only in 2014 that the total
banning of incineration was implemented in Pila. Thus, even now that the type of
waste in Pila changed due to land use changes, some of the residents still could
not refrain from burning their waste.

It is then concluded that the incineration of waste of the residents is the
interplay of the temporal qualities, the physical environment, and their knowledge

and attitude on the said practice.


Waste Disposal

Psychological processes. Based on the result, majority of the
respondents have their waste collected by the garbage collectors. Some also
said that they sold their waste to junk shops, bury them, and even pile them at
their backyards. Majority of the respondents consider the aforementioned waste
disposal practices as proper segregation practices. Thus, their knowledge on
these waste disposal practices could have had affected their actions. In terms of
their attitude, majority of the respondents believe that it is indeed their
responsibility to take out their trash for its collection. Therefore, this is affecting
their waste disposal practice. Their knowledge on waste disposal is, in turn,

affecting their attitude towards it as well.

Physical environment. The different landscapes of the municipality affect
their waste disposal practice. Most of those who opt for waste collection are
mostly from the urban barangay of Sta. Clara Sur. This is because they usually
do not have enough lands to bury or pile their waste. Those who resort to other
waste disposal means, on the other hand, are from the rural barangays of Pansol
and Pinagbayanan. This is because they have the space to bury or pile their
waste. Moreover, the respondents from these barangays have more litter fall thus

‘selecting other means of reducing their waste.


Also, the waste management facilities of the municipality greatly affect the
waste disposal practice of the residents. Most of the residents who take their
trash out for collection are along the collection route or situated in the urban
barangays. However, those who opt for other means, including burning of waste,
are not along the collection route and are mostly from the rural barangays.
Nonetheless, the current program of the municipality on collection of waste is
starting to encourage the residents to opt for waste collection. Yet, the physical

characteristic of the barangays is currently restricting the waste collection route.

Temporal qualities. The history of the ordinances on waste disposal
affected the respondents’ practices as well. As presented, as early as 1973, the
municipality prohibits the dumping of waste in public roads and space thus
people are refraining from dumping them in these areas. However, some are still
littering public areas and this might be affected by their attitude that small wastes
like candy wrappers are negligible.

Moreover, since the municipality is agricultural in nature, their wastes are
mostly agricultural waste. Some respondents are still practicing waste disposal
practices like the ones they are practicing before, i.e. burying and piling up their
waste in their backyards.

In general, it is therefore concluded that the history of land use, from
agricultural to residential, has affected the current characteristics of the

barangays, thus, changing the type of waste generated by the constituents.


Moreover, through the changing land use, the laws and ordinances on solid
waste management have evolved as illustrated by the history of SWM
ordinances. The evolution in land use also calls for the improvement of waste
facilities to address the growing waste. Solid waste programs are now
significantly needed. The respondents’ knowledge and attitude towards proper
solid waste management also evolved through time and is dependent on the
progression of their physical environment. Thus, their current solid waste
practices are attributed to the interplay of these aspects. However, the study only
cited identified patterns in relation to waste segregation, 3Rs, incineration of
waste, and its disposal. Indeed, some of these waste management schemes
does not clearly illustrate relationship with all the aspects. Nonetheless, this
study does not discredit the existence of these connections. Further studies have

to be done in order to understand them even more

Recommendations for the Improvement

of Solid Waste Management

After understanding the current solid waste practices of the respondents
and analyzing its relation to other aspects, recommendations were formulated to

improve solid waste management in the municipality of Pila.


Waste Segregation

It was found out that majority of the respondents segregate their waste
into non-biodegradable and biodegradable. However, some of them fails to sort
their waste. In order to encourage the respondents to sort their waste, it would be
better to conduct seminars or intensify information drive on waste segregation
given that some are still confused with the classification of their waste. Also,
categories maybe expanded from biodegradable and non-biodegradable to
biodegradable, residuals, and recyclables.

Moreover, SWM programs should also include diversion of waste other
than merely being collected for disposal. Opportunities of transforming waste to
another resource, aside from selling them to junk shops, have to be explained to
the residents for them to be encouraged to segregate their waste. To cite an
example, biodegradable waste can be surrendered to collectors as food for
livestock or as raw materials for composting

Furthermore, in terms of the residential waste facilities of the respondents
who complain on their lack of trashcans, provision for trashcans can be
considered. Else, residents have to be taught on other ways of securing their
own trashcans like using recycled large plastic bottles or pails as alternatives.
Also, in case their residential waste facilities are not enough to receive their

waste, since it is only collected twice a week - one for biodegradable and one for


non-biodegradable, a community bin per category can be provided as
receptacles for weekly collection.

To foster a stronger participation on waste segregation, it is recommended
that an ordinance be written in accordance to RA 9003. It might not matter so
much in the current segregation practices of the residents but in the long run it

can affect the future behavior of the people.

Reducing, Recycling, and Reusing

It was found that majority of the respondents recycle and reuse their
waste. Moreover, they are willing to reduce their waste by avoiding plastics. To
further acquaint them on ways to reduce, recycle, and reuse waste, it would be
better if the municipality could include these topics on their massive information
drive, whether be it through Information, Education, and Communication (IEC)
materials or full blown seminars. Nonetheless, the respondents have positive
attitude towards 3Rs.

However, their understanding of recycling is only limited to selling them to
junk shops, aside from using them as materials for home decor and school
projects. Thus, it would be better to educate the people on other opportunities for
recycling like turning residual waste, such as snack wrappers, into arts and
crafts. These then can be sold as souvenirs for tourism campaign. Or, like one of

the residents is doing, it can be rolled in to beads and turn into deviant gowns for


competition. Also, since some of them are still using coals, paper waste can be
tumed into paper briquettes, instead on selling them to junk shops. This then can
be sold to the community or to the neighboring municipalities. Upcycling these
waste can encourage the residents from merely throwing them or selling them at
a minimal price.

In connection, the MRF can house the aforementioned projects to give
value to the municipal waste of Pila. Instead of using the solid waste budget on
transfer of waste from MRF to sanitary landfills, it would be of great help to the
community if funds can be redirected to income generating activities.

In addition, the respondents are knowledgeable on the program of the
municipality on the use of plastics. Currently, the municipality is using paper bags.
and eco bags as replacement for plastic bags. However, paper bags can also
add up to the waste if use inappropriately. Thus, the municipality should
encourage the use of reusable materials like eco bags and bayongs. Also,
feconsidering the use of oxo-biodegradable plastics should be explored since
these are more durable and can withstand weight better than paper bags.

Like the recommendation for waste segregation, it is advised to enact an
ordinance on reducing, recycling, and reusing of waste. This is mostly to benefit

the future behavior of the residents of Pila, Laguna.


Waste Incineration

Most of the respondents are refraining from burning their waste. However,
some are still burning a portion, if not all, of their waste. Since it was found that
their knowledge and attitude on incineration is divided, educating them on the
negative effects of buming can encourage them to stop such practice. Topics on
waste incineration can be included in the SWM program of the municipality.

Since some residents are seeing some benefits from burning, the
municipality should be able to address this issue. For one, as some of the
respondents declared, burning can encourage flowering of plants. The
municipality, in partnership with government agencies like the Department of
Agriculture, should be able to provide other environmental friendly methods to
encourage flowering of plants. Moreover, some residents said that burning drive
away insects thus the municipality, in coordination with government organizations
like the Department of Health, should provide or acquaint the residents with
alternative methods on preventing insects from proliferating.

Moreover, some respondents complain on their uncollected waste. To
address this, the municipality should provide other means of collecting their trash
if the narrow roads hinder the entrance of garbage trucks. It can be the collectors’
use of wheel barrows or pedicabs just to bring the waste along the collection
route. Installment of community bins will also be of help to address issue on

uncollected waste. Diversion of waste, as previously mentioned, can encourage


them to stop burning their waste given that one of the respondents’ objectives for
burning is to reduce waste.

Also, since there are already existing laws on burning, its strict
implementation needs to be sustained. The people should realize that their
municipality is committed in their solid waste management programs. It would
take some time for the respondents to adjust to this ordinance given that they are
burning their waste for a long time. However, it would be beneficial for the future

generation if incineration of waste out in the open will not be practiced anymore.

Waste Disposal

Majority of the respondents have positive attitude towards waste disposal,
specifically taking their trash out for collection and refraining from improperly
throwing their waste. Nonetheless, some people resort to littering as observed
Thus, this indeed requires behavior change through education and strict
implementation of ordinance. The amendment of Municipal Ordinance No. 012-
97 may also be needed to encourage participation for a litter-free municipality.

Moreover, to motivate the residents to opt for the collection of waste,
proper municipal waste facility has to be provided like additional collection route
or other collection schemes, as well as community bins. Also, the residents
request balik-sako or returning of sacks after waste collection so they do not

have to buy two sacks every week.


The municipality does not prohibit burying of waste, especially if the
residents have enough space to do so, however, the residents should be able to
discern waste that may be buried from those that compromise the health of the
‘soil and ground water. Also, piling of waste in one’s backyard is not discouraged,
however it should not compromise the health and safety of other individuals.
Proper waste disposal has to be discussed further and together with the current
SWM program of the municipality.

In general, it is advised that the municipality's program on solid waste
continue with great commitment on serving the people and the betterment of all
Indeed, the municipality is doing a great job in encouraging participation from the
residents. Sustaining these efforts can eventually change the negative behaviors
and nourish the positive ones.

Moreover, devolution of effort from the municipality to the barangays has
to be organized for the success of the programs. This is also to ensure that the
advocacy will trickle down to the individuals comprising each barangays. Indeed,
the municipality is currently organizing a contest to reward barangays with the
best solid waste management schemes. More than encouraging competition
among barangays, it should be explained that this is for the common good of
addressing problems on solid waste.

CHAPTER V

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This study aimed to improve solid waste management in Pila, Laguna by
understanding the underlying reason behind the current solid waste management
practices. Through transactional approach, the study described the current solid
waste management practices of the constituents. Moreover, it identified their
knowledge and attitude towards solid waste management as well as the physical
environment and the temporal qualities that can affect these practices.

The objectives were satisfied by conducting a survey among the different
landscapes of Pila. Representative barangays for the upland, urban, and
lakeshore communities were selected. Based on the amount of waste generated,
Barangay Pansol, Sta. Clara Sur, and Pinagbayanan acted as representatives for
upland, urbans, and lakeshore barangays, respectively. In addition, Key
Informant Interview was conducted and secondary data were used to understand
the current solid waste management practices.

Solid waste management practices included in the study are waste
segregation, recycling and reusing of waste, incineration of waste, and waste
disposal. It was then found out that majority of the respondents are sorting their

waste while some are not segregating their waste yet. The most common reason


for not segregating is that they do not have enough time to do so. However,
those who sort their waste usually do so for the benefit of exchanging recyclables
for cash or salt and so that it would be easier to collect their waste if it is
segregated. Respondents often sort them in to non-biodegradable and
biodegradable.

Moreover, it was found that most of the respondents claimed that they are
recycling or reusing their waste while some said that they are not practicing these
schemes. However, both the non-recyclers and recyclers reasoned out that this
is because they are selling their recyclables to junk shops. Most of those who
recycle or reuse their waste recycle or reuse plastic bottles and plastic bags.

In terms of their incineration practice, it was discovered that most of them
are refraining from burning their waste. However, a portion still burns their waste
for the reason that they would want to reduce waste to be collected. Also, some
said that burning encourage flowering of plants and drive away insects. Some
said that their wastes are not collected regularly. Commonly, the respondents
burn leaves and papers while some also burn plastic wastes. Nonetheless, those
who are not practicing incineration reasoned that it is prohibited to burn waste.

Since most of the respondents do not burn their waste, majority of them
claimed that they sell their waste to junk shops. Also, most respondents let
garbage collectors pick up their trash while some prefer to bury them or pile them

up in their backyards.


In general, the respondents are knowledgeable on proper solid waste
management. However, some thinks that burning of waste is one of the proper
waste management, as well as, piling of waste in their backyards. Most of those
who mentioned these are from the rural barangays of Pansol and Pinagbayanan.
Almost all also know the negative effects of improperly managed waste except
chemical poisoning. Moreover, though most classify waste correctly, some of the
respondents are confused with categories of waste. Most of the respondents are
knowledgeable on RA 9003 and the municipal ordinances on solid waste.
According to them, segregation of waste, regulation of plastics, banning of
incineration, proper waste collection, and banning of littering are some of the
municipal ordinances.

Moreover, result shows that the respondents have positive attitude
towards the solid waste management practices mentioned. Also, they are most
willing to participate in proper solid waste management programs.

In terms of the physical environment, through transect mapping, it was
found that the landscapes of Pila vary and is one of the examples of a ridge-to-
reef community. Residential waste facilities of the respondents are commonly
sacks aside from plastic bags, trash can and boxes. Furthermore, municipal
waste facilities include colored trash cans lining public spaces, color coded trucks
for collection and waste, and a Material Recovery Facility situated in one of the

barangays of the municipality. Based on the collection schedule, it was


discovered that some areas are not yet included in the collection route. Thus,
their wastes are not being collected

Current municipal ordinances include the prohibition of littering or dumping
of waste along public roads and places. Also, a municipal ordinance on the
regulated use of plastics is being implemented in the municipality. Two
ordinances address open burning. One is the prohibition of burning rice hulls and
hays and the other one is the total banning of open burning of residential waste.
Aside from the ordinances, solid waste management programs are being
campaigned in the municipality. Based on the history of solid waste ordinances in
the municipality, it was found out that ordinances focused on agricultural wastes.
Only in the recent years that municipal ordinances on other types of waste is
being addressed. This may be attributed to the history of the municipality's land
use.

It is therefore concluded that the current solid waste management
practices of the residents are explained by interplay of psychological processes,
physical environment, and temporal qualities. As observed, waste segregation
practice may be attributed to the respondents’ accurate knowledge on
segregation and positive attitude towards it. Moreover, the limitations on
segregation is rooted on the lack of residential waste facilities as well as
municipal facilities. These are also observed in the reducing, recycling, and

reusing practices. However, as found out, knowledge on 3Rs is very limited. The


MRF is also not utilized to divert waste and convert them in a more income
generating materials.

In terms of incineration, the psychological processes of the respondents
undeniably affect their behavior. The different landscapes also affect burning
practices, together with, residential and municipal waste facilities. Temporal
qualities on solid waste significantly affect burning practice. Waste disposal is
also affected by these aspects. Indeed, some of these waste management
schemes does not clearly illustrate relationship with all the aspects. Nonetheless,
this study does not discredit the existence of these connections.

After understanding the reasons behind current solid waste management
practices of the respondents, tailor-fitted recommendations were formulated to
further improve solid waste management in the municipality. One of the
recommendations is to improve municipal programs through campaigns and IEC
materials. Also, enactment of ordinances on segregation, 3Rs, and waste
disposal can potentially improve waste management. Moreover, amendments
and strict implementation of existing ordinances is also advised. Diversion of
waste through income generating programs like arts and crafts, as well as paper
briquette making, is another way of encouraging the residents from participating
in solid waste programs in 3Rs. Provision of community bins and trash cans is
another suggestion. Moreover, alternative programs like environmentally friendly
methods to encourage flowering of plants and drive away insects may motivate

the respondents to refrain from burning.


As a conclusion, transactional analysis is a holistic approach to
understand behavior. Through this study, current solid waste management
practices of Pila Laguna are better understood. Thus, formulation of strategies for
an effective solid waste management for the municipality will be easier. Thus, the

chance of encouraging residents to participate is relatively high

CHAPTER VI

SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDIES

To improve the study, other aspects of transactional approach may be
included. Social interactions among the residents may be explored to further
explain their solid waste management practices. Also, temporal qualities, like the
evolution of waste generated by the municipality as land use changes, may also
be looked into and added as aspect for analysis. Moreover, to further understand
the solid waste practices of the constituents from Pila, Laguna, instead of using
self-reported behavior, it will be more accurate if the observed behavior of the
respondents will be scrutinized. Increasing the number of respondents as well as
selecting representatives from the 17 different barangays of Pila might also
garner a different result from what this study discovered.

Using the transactional approach, studying a different locale, is
recommended. Locale can be a municipality practicing best solid waste
management schemes. It is suggested to study and understand their behavior
through transactional analysis. Findings can then be applied to other

municipalities with poor solid waste management if possible.


This study uses transactional analysis to understand current solid waste
management of the residents. However, this approach still has its limitations.
Primarily, it does not follow any structure to explain behavior. Moreover, analysis
can only be done based on the patterns inferred from the gathered information.
The said approach claimed a holistic take on the issue yet it cannot fully exhaust
reasons behind the residents’ current solid waste management practices.
Therefore, it is suggested to use other environmental psychology frameworks like
the Theory of Planned Behaviors. Moreover, other environmental science
theories like the study of institutions involved in the solid waste management may

be employed.
