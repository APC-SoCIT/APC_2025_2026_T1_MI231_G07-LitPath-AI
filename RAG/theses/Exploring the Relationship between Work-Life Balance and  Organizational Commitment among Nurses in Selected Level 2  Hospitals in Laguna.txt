ABSTRACT  
This study explores the relationship between work -life balance an d organizational commitment among nurses 
in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna. Using a quantitative approach, data were collected through a structured survey 
questionnaire, encompassing demographic profiles, a Work -Life Balance Scale, and an Organizational 
Commi tment Scale. Statistical analysis revealed that nurses generally perceive their work -life balance as 
moderate, with strengths in balancing personal and professional responsibili ties but challenges in 
organizational support. Organizational commitment was fo und to be strong, particularly in affective and 
normative dimensions, while continuance commitment showed slightly weaker associations. A significant 
moderate positive correlation was identified between work -life balance and organizational commitment, 
emph asizing the importance of achieving work -life integration to foster loyalty and satisfaction. Demographic 
factors such as age, marital status, and years of service significantly  influenced this relationship, highlighting 
the need for tailored interventions . Based on these findings, the Work -Life Balance and Commitment 
Enhancement Program (WLBCEP) was proposed, incorporating flexible scheduling, wellness initiatives, and 
stress -reduction strategies to enhance both work -life balance and organizational commitm ent. These results 
underscore the vital role of supportive organizational practices in improving nurse retention and overall 
healthcare outcomes.

INTR ODUCTION  
Work -life balance is one of the key elements that may have an impact on worker p roductivity. The presence of 
conflicts in an employee's personal and professional life can raise stress levels, which in turn can lower morale, 
cause low productivity , and reduce satisfaction with one's job and employer. An organization's effectiveness is 
influenced by how well the work -life balance concept is applied. There is a connection between work -life 
balance and the worker, as well as the company or location wh ere they are employed. Its function was to 
determine how an individual manages his personal and professional lives. Work -life balance may have an 
impact on employees' mental or psychological health, which may then have an impact on their performance.  
Emplo yee devotion to their company was demonstrated by their attention to detail, effort, and evaluation of the 
benefits they had received from it. This was known as organizational c ommitment, and it was valued highly by 
staff members. On the other hand, organi zational commitment refers to the degree to which staff members 
accept and believe in the organization's objectives and wish to stay with it. Employee involvement —the degree 
to which a worker was ready and able to contribute —was a related concept. It was a lso mentioned that people 
were more inclined to leave an organization if they were unhappy with their jobs or if they lacked 
organizational commitment.  
The multifaceted aspect of organizational commitment encompasses employee activities, a desire for 
memb ership, and exhibiting alignment with the organization's values and objectives. Employees' sense of

 attachment to the company they work for is referred to as organizational commitment. Every organization is 
thought to need organizational commitment as its primary prerequisite. It is the primary determinant of worker 
performance, attitudes, and values. It also has a significant impact on worker loyalty, which fosters a worker's 
emotional bond with a company)  [17]. Optimizing healthcare delivery requires an understanding of the 
dynamics of organizational commitment and work -life balance among nurses in a Level 2 hospital in Laguna. 
This research would offer practical ins ights that can guide initiatives and procedures targeted at improving the 
performance of hospitals and nurse well -being by looking at these interrelated characteristics.   
Using  a quantitative research approach, data were collected through a structured su rvey questionnaire. The 
questionnaire comprised sections on demographic profile, a Work -Life Balance Scale, and an Organizational 
Commitment Scale, all measured using a 5 -point Likert scale. Statistical methods such as descriptive statistics, 
Pearson’s cor relation analysis, and subgroup analysis were employed to address the research questions 
systematically.  
METHODOLOGY  
Research Design  
This study employed a quantitative approach, which involved the collection and statistical analysis of 
numerical data. Thi s approach allowed for objective measurement of both work -life balance and organizational 
commitment levels among nurses, providing a structured and systematic way to quantify relationships between 
these variables [12].  
On the other hand, a correlational design was utilized  in this study. Correlational design focused on identifying 
and quantifying the relationship between work -life balance and organizational commitment. T his design 
enabled  the authors to measure both the strength and direction of the relationship (e.g., positive, negative, or no 
correlation) between the two variables, providing valuable insights into the dynamics between them [12]. By 
applying a correlational design, the stu dy sought to determine whether a higher perception of work -life balance 
among nurses was associated with higher levels of organizational commitment. Th is approach proved 
particularly useful in non -experimental studies, as it allowed researchers to observe relationships between 
variables as they naturally occurred, without manipulation, and to statistically assess whether an association 
existed  [16]. 
Furthermore, the study used a cross -sectional survey method, where data were collected from nurses at a single 
point in time. This appro ach was efficient and allowed for gathering a snapshot of work -life balance and 
organizational commitment perceptions across Level 2 hospitals in Laguna. Cross -sectional surveys proved 
useful for correlational studies as they enabled researchers to assess the current state of variables without 
requiring longitudinal data.  
Study Setting and Participants  
The po pulation of this study consisted of nurses working in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna. This population was 
chosen due to the unique demands and challenges nurses face in these healthcare settings, where they often 
balanced intensive job responsibilities with personal and family obligations. Targeting this specific group 
allowed the study to provide insights into how work -life balance impacted organizational commitment within 
the context of nursing —a profession known for high stress levels and demandi ng schedule s [26]. 
The study employed a convenience sampling technique to re cruit participants. Convenience sampling is a non -
probability sampling method that involved selecting participants who were readily available and willi ng to 
participate in the study [12]. This technique proved practical and efficient, especially in healthcare settings, 
where nurses’ work schedules limited their availability for participation. Although convenience sa mpling may 
have limited the generalizability of findings, it allowed the authors to access a representative portion of the 
nursing population within the specified hospitals, providing valuable insights into the relationship between 
work -life balance and organizational commitment [14].

 Research Instrument  
The research instrument for the study  was a structured survey questionnaire specifically designed to collect 
quantitative data on the respondents' demographic profile, perceived work -life balance, and organizational 
commitment. Divided into three main sections, the instrument captured a comprehensive view of each 
respondent's experience and commitment level. The first section gathered demographic information, such as 
age, sex, mar ital status, years of service, and current position, which helped to contextu alize responses and 
enabled the researchers to analyze potential demographic influences on work -life balance and organizational 
commitment  [26]. 
The second section utilized a Work -Life Balance Scale, a 5 -point Likert scale that assessed the respondents' 
perception of their ability to balance work responsibilities with personal life. Statements in this section, such as 
"I am able to balance my work responsibilities with my personal life" and "My organization provides sufficient 
support for maintaining work -life balance," allowed respondents to express varying levels of agreement or 
disagreement, pro viding nuanced data about their work -life satisfaction. This scale captured essential aspects 
of the nurses' work -life balance, which was pivotal to understanding their organizational commitmen t [12]. 
The final section of the instrument assessed o rganizational commitment across three dimensions: affective 
commitment (emotional attachment), continuance commitment (cost of leaving), and normative commitment 
(sense of obligat ion). This section also employed a 5 -point Likert scale, with items such as "I feel a strong 
sense of belonging to my organization" (affective), "Leaving this organization would require significant 
personal sacrifice" (continuance), and "I feel an obligati on to remain with this organization" (normative). By 
including these three di mensions, the instrument offered a comprehensive measure of organizational 
commitment, which aligned well with the study's aim of exploring its relationship with work -life balance  [3]. 
The structured format of the questionnaire allowed for efficient data collection and ensured that responses 
could be objectively analyzed. This approach aligned wit h the study's quantitative correlational design, as it 
enabled the authors to gather consistent data that was used to assess relationships between work -life balance 
and commitment levels. Using standardized scales also enhanced the instrument's reliability  and validity, 
ensuring that the data collected accurately reflected the nurses' experienc es and perceptions [9]. Overall, this 
instrument was well -suited to address the study’s objectives, providing clear and measurable insights into the 
factors influencing organizational commitment among nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna.  
Validation and Reliability  
Ensuring the reliability and validity of the research instrument was essential for collecting data that accurately 
and consistently represented the constructs of work -life balance and organizational commitment among nurses. 
Reliability referred to the instrument's consistency, meaning it yielded similar results under consis tent 
conditions. In this study, reliability was assessed through internal con sistency, measured using Cronbach's 
alpha, which determined how well the items in each section (work -life balance and organizational 
commitment) correlated with one another [26]. The results of the reliability analysis indicated a Cronbach's 
alpha of 0.84 for the Work -Life Balance Scale and 0.89 for the Organizational Commitment Scale, 
demonstrati ng strong internal consistency for both sections. These values exceeded the g enerally accepted 
threshold of 0.7, suggesting that the items within each section reliably measured the same underlying 
construct.  
Validity, on the other hand, addressed the instr ument’s accuracy —whether it measured what it was intended to 
measure. Content validity for this study was established by ensuring that each item in the questionnaire was 
relevant to and representative of the concepts of work -life balance and organizational  commitment. This was 
achieved through expert review, where professionals in nursing and organizational psychology assessed the 
items to confirm they adequately covered all asp ects of these constructs [12]. Additionally, construct validity 
was confirmed, as the items aligned with theoretical frameworks, such as Meyer and Allen's (1991) model of 
organizational commitment, which included affective, continuance, and normative  dimensions. The use of 
well-established scales for work -life balance and org anizational commitment further supported construct 
validity, as these scales had been validated in previous studies, confirming their appropriateness for this 
research [9].

 To enhance reliability and validity, pilot testing was conducted before the main data collection phase. Pilot 
testing involved administering the survey to a small, representati ve sample of 30 nurses in Level 2 hospitals in 
a nearby region with similar characteristics. This preliminary phase allowed researchers to assess the clarity, 
relevance, and appropriateness of each item, identifying potential issues that could arise during  the actual 
survey (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Feedback from pilot test partici pants highlighted that all items were clear 
and relevant, and no major revisions were necessary.  
A pilot testing provided an initial measure of reliability through Cronbach's a lpha for each scale within the 
instrument. The Work -Life Balance Scale achieved a Cronbach's alpha of 0.82, while the Organizational 
Commitment Scale yielded a Cronbach's alpha of 0.88, indicat ing strong internal consistency . Additionally, the 
pilot test s upported content validity by allowing experts and respondents to confirm that th e instrument 
adequately covered all aspects of work -life balance and organizational commitment relevant to nurses. This 
phase confirmed that the survey accurately captured the intended constructs and identified no missing 
components or  unnecessary items [9]. 
Construct validity was further strengthened through the pilot testing process, as the scales aligned with 
theoretical frameworks and accurately measured the specified dimensions, such as affective, continuance, and 
normative commitment within the Organizational Commitment Scale. Incorporating pilot testing into the 
research process allowed researchers to refine the instrument to ensure it was both reliable and valid. This 
process minimized the risk of measurement errors and enhanced the credibility of the findings, providing a 
more accurate and robust analysis of the relationship between wor k-life balance and organizational 
commitment among nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna.  
Data Collection Procedure  
This study involves several structured steps to ensure the collection of accurate and reliable data from the 
target population.  
Step 1: Prep aration and Coordination  
The data gathering process began with obtaining necessary permissions and ethical clearance from the relevant 
hospital authorities and ethics re view boards. Approval ensured that the study adhered to ethical standards, 
including in formed consent, confidentiality, and voluntary participation. The author also coordinated with 
hospital administrators or nursing department heads to arrange logistics and scheduled the data collection in a 
way that minimized disruptions to the nurse s' wor kflow [26]. 
Step 2: Pilot Testing of the Instrument  
Before the main data collection , a pilot test of the survey instrument was conducted with a small sample of 
nurses in similar healthcare settings, such as Level 2 hospitals in nearby regions. This pilot test allowed the 
researcher to assess the clarity, reliability, and validity of the questionnaire items. Feedback from pilot test 
participants was used to revise any uncle ar or problematic questions, enhancing the instrument’s overall 
quality. Pilot testing also provided an initial measure of internal consistency, using Cronbach's alpha t o 
confirm reliability for the Work -Life Balance Scale and Organizational Commitment Sca le. The results 
showed a Cronbach's alpha of 0.82 for the Work -Life Balance Scale and 0.88 for the Organizational 
Commitment Scale, demonstrating strong reliabi lity [12]. 
Step 3: Recruitment and Informed Consent  
After refining the instrument, the researcher began recruiting participants from the target population. Potential 
participants were approached and informed about the study’s purpose, procedures, benefits, and any p otential 
risks. An informed consent form was provided, detailing their right to confidentiality and the voluntary nature 
of their participation. Only those who agreed to participate by signing the informed consent form were 
included in the study.

 Step 4: D istribution of the Survey Questionnaire  
With consent obtained, the survey questionnaire was distributed to the participants. Depending on feasibility 
and convenience for the nurses, the questionnaire was administered either as a paper -based survey or an on line 
survey using a secure platform. Each questionnaire included instructions for completion, along with a 
designated timeframe to ensure that responses were gathered promptly. A 5 -point Likert scale was used for 
sections on work -life balance and organizat ional commitment, allowing for standardized responses that were 
suitable for quan titative analysis [9]. 
Step 5: Data Collection and Monitoring  
During the data collection period, the author  was available to clarify any questions participants had regarding 
the survey. If the survey was administered in person, the author visited the hospitals to monitor the process, 
collect completed surveys, and ensure adherence to the timel ine. In the case of an online survey, periodic 
reminders were sent to participants to encourage timely completion and submission. This monitoring helped 
maximize response rates and ensured that data was collected within the planne d timeframe [26]. 
Step 6: Data Verification and Handling  
Once all responses were collected, the author reviewed the questionnaires to check for completeness and 
accuracy. Incomplete or er roneous r esponses were identified, and any unusable data was excluded from 
analysis. For online responses, data was automatically organized in a spreadsheet, simplifying the verification 
process. The data was then prepared for statistical analysis by encoding respo nses into a database, ensuring 
that data entry was accurate and consistent.  
Step 7: Data Analysis  
After data verification, the collected data was analyzed statistically. Descriptive statistics were used to 
summarize demographic information and ass ess the l evels of work -life balance and organizational 
commitment among respondents. Correlation and regression analysis were conducted to determine the 
relationship between work -life balance and organizational commitment, providing insights into whether higher 
levels of work -life balance were associated with greater organizational commitment among nurses in the 
sample [12]. 
Step 8: Data Storage and Confidentiality  
To ensu re confid entiality, all physical questionnaires were securely stored, and digital data was encrypted and 
saved on a password -protected computer. Identifying information was removed to maintain anonymity. The 
data was stored securely for a specified period before be ing destroyed, in line with ethical guidelines and data  
protection policies [9]. 
Data Analysis  
The data analysis for this study was structured to address each re search qu estion systematically , using both 
descriptive and inferential statistical methods. To begin, the demographic profile of the respondents, including 
age, sex, marital status, years of service, and current position, was analyzed using descriptive statistics.  
Frequency counts and percentages were calculated for categorical data, while mean and standard deviation 
were used for continuous data such as age and years of service.   
This analysis provided a clear summary of the sample's composition, offerin g context  for interpreting the 
findings.  
The second research question, which investigated the level of work -life balance perceived by nurses , utilized 
descriptive statistics. Mean scores and standard deviations were calculated based on responses to the Likert -
scale items , indicating whether nurses generally perceived high, moderate, or low levels of work -life balance. 
Similarly, the third question, which examined the level of organizational commitment among nurses , was

 analyzed by calculating mean scores  and stan dard deviations for each dimension of organizational 
commitment —affective, continuance, and normative —as well as the overall commitment score. This approach 
helped identify the general level of commitment and highlighted any specific commitment dimensions that 
were more prominent among the nurses.  
To address the fourth question, which explored the relationship between work -life balance and organizational 
commitment , Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used. This test measured the strength and d irection of the 
relationship between these two variables . A significant positive correlation indicated that higher levels of 
work -life balance were associated with greater organizational commitment, while a weak or non -significant 
correlation suggested little to n o relationship between the variables.  
Finally, for the fifth question, which investigated whether the relationship between work -life balance and 
organizational commitment  varied by demographic profile, inferential tests were employed. Independen t t-tests 
were used to compare means between two groups, such as male and female nurses, while one -way ANOVA 
was applied to demographic variables with more than two categories, such as age groups and years of service. 
If significant differences were found in ANOVA,  post hoc tests (e.g., Tukey's HSD) were conducted to 
pinpoint specific group differences.  
Statement of the Problem  
This study aims to explore the relationship between organizational commitment and work -life balance among 
nurses working at Laguna 's Level 2 hospitals. Specifically, this study sought to answer the following 
questions:  
1. What is the demographic profile of the respondents in terms of:  
a. Age 
b. Sex 
c. Marital Status  
d. Years of Service  
e. Current Position  
2. What is the level of work -life balance perceived by nur ses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna?  
3. What is the level of organizational commitment among nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna?  
4. Is there a significant relationship between work -life balance and organizational commitment among nurses 
in Level 2 hospitals in  Laguna?  
5. Is there any significant relationship between nurses' perception of work -life balance and organizational 
commitment when grouped according to the demographic profile?  
6. Based on the results of the study, what output can be made?  
In summary, this ana lysis plan combined descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and inferential testing to 
provide comprehensive answers to each research question. Descriptive statistics offered a profile of the 
respondents and their perceptions of work -life balance and  commitment, while correlation and inferential tests 
explored the strength of relationships and the potential influence of demographic factors. This structured 
approach ensured  a thorough understanding of how work -life balance and organizational commitment  were 
experienced by nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna.  
Ethical Considerations  
The Informed Consent: Participants were fully informed about the purpose, scope, procedures, potential risks, 
and benefits of the study. They received a clear explanation th at their participation was voluntary and that they 
could withdraw from the study at any time without any consequences. The informed consent form outlined 
these details and ensu red that participants understood their rights before agreeing to participate. Ob taining 
informed consent was crucial to respecting participants’ autonomy and right to make an informed decision 
regarding their involvement in the study [26]. 
Confidenti ality and Anonymity: The study ensured confidentiality and anonymity of participants’ responses. 
Identifying information, such as names, addresses, or specific job titles, was not collected unless absolutely

 necessary. Data was coded to prevent direct iden tification of individual participants, and responses were 
reported in aggregate form. This helped protect participants’ identities and encouraged honest responses, 
knowing that their personal information would not be discl osed [12]. 
Philippine Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173): The study complied with the Philippine Data 
Privacy  Act of 2012, which mandated the protection of personal data collected, processe d, and stored in the 
Philippines. Under this law, the researcher ensured that participants’ data was handled responsibly and 
securely. This included using appropriate safeguards to protect data from unauthorized access, ensuring that 
data processing was li mited to the purposes of the study, and implementing data disposal measures once the 
study was complete. Any personal information collected was stored securely, with digital da ta encrypted and 
physical documents kept in locked storage. Only the research te am had access to the data, which was retained 
only as long as necessary for the study’s purposes before being securely destroyed (National Privacy 
Commission, 2012).  
Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI): If AI tools were used for data analysis o r assistance in data 
organization, the researcher ensured the ethical use of AI. This included selecting AI tools that complied with 
data protection laws and did not store or share participants’ personal data without consent. The use of AI was 
limited to a nalysis, aggregation, and organization of data, with careful attention to preserving the anonymity 
and confidentiality of the information. Furthermore, any AI -based insights were validated by human oversight 
to avoid biases or errors in interpretation. The  researcher ensured that AI did not compromise the ethical 
standards of the study and that any AI usage was disclosed to participants.  
Data Storage and Disposal: Data security was a priority in this study. Collected data was stored in a password -
protected digital system or a secure physical location to prevent unauthorized access. Once the data was 
analyzed and the study was complete, all personal data was disposed of  in accordance with ethical guidelines 
and the Philippine Data Privacy Act. Physical data w as shredded, and electronic data was permanently deleted, 
ensuring no residual data that could potentially compromise participan t confidentiality [9]. 
Avoiding Harm and E nsuring Beneficence: The study was designed to avoid causing psychological or 
emotional harm to participants. Survey questions were reviewed to ensure that they did not include sensitive or 
invasive content. The research process was transparent, and partic ipants had access to the researcher to ask 
questions or address any concerns that arose during or after the study. Additionally, the potential benefits of 
the study, such as insights into improving nurses' work -life balance and organizational commitment, w ere 
communicated to participants, fulfilling the principle of beneficence.  
Presentation of Data  
Demographic Profile  
Research Question 1 focuses on understanding the demographic profile of the respondents, specifically nurses 
working in Level 2 hospitals in  Laguna. Examining demographic factors such as age, sex, marital status, years 
of service, and current position provides essential context for interpreting the study's findings. These variables 
can influence perceptions of work -life balance and organizatio nal commitment, as previous studies suggest 
that individual characteristics and professional roles often shape how employees manage their responsibilities 
and feel c onnected to their organizations. By identifying the demographic makeup of the respondents, the 
study lays a foundation for analyzing potential patterns and relationships within the data, ensuring a 
comprehensive exploration of the research objectives.  
Age 
Table 1 shows the age distribution of the respondents. The majority of the nurses (40%) fal l within the 31 –40 
age group, followed by 35% in the 21 –30 age group. This indicates that most of the respondents are relatively 
young, which could be attributed to the physically demanding nature of nursing work. Fewer respondents 
(25%) were aged 41 and a bove, reflecting the potential challenges in retaining older nurses in these roles.

The demographic profile of the respondents indicates that the sample is predominantly young, female, and 
married, with the majority holding staff nurse positions and possessing 5 –10 years of experience. These 
characteristics provide critical context for understanding their perceptions of work -life balance and 
organizational commitment.  
Level of Work -Life Balance Perceived by Nurses in Level 2 Hospitals in Laguna  
Resear ch Question 2 examines the level of work -life balance perceived by nurses in Level 2 hospitals in 
Laguna. Work -life balance refers to the ability of individuals to effectively manage and prioritize their 
professional responsibilities alongside personal and  family commitments. This question seeks to explore how 
nurses perceive their capacity to achieve this balance, considering the demanding nature of their roles in 
healthcare settings. Understanding these perceptions is essential, as work -life balance signi ficantly influences 
job satisfaction, well -being, and overall organizational commitment. By assessing these levels, the study aims 
to provide insights into the challenges nurses face and the support systems that may enhance their work -life 
integration.

 satisfaction as well as opportunities for improvement.  The high est-rated statement, "I am able to balance my 
work responsibilities with my personal life" (mean = 4.0, interpreted as " Agree"), suggests that many nurses 
feel capable of managing their work and personal lives effectively. This finding reflects positively on the 
adaptability and resilience of the respondents in navigating the demands of their profession. Similarly, the 
statement "I rarely feel overwhelmed by work demands that affect my personal life" (mean = 3.6, interpreted 
as "Agree") shows that a notable  proportion of nurses experience manageable workloads and minimal 
interference with their personal lives. These results highlight a relatively positive aspect of work -life balance 
among the respondents, which may contribute to reduced stress levels and inc reased job satisfa ction [12]. 
However, certain aspects of work -life balance were rated lower, reflecting challenges faced by nurses in 
achieving an optimal balance. The s tatement "I am satisfied with the amount of time I have for my hobbies or 
personal interests" received a mean score of 3.2, indicating a "Neutral" response. This suggests that while 
some nurses may find time for personal interests, others struggle to engag e in activities outside of work due to 
time constraints. Similarly, "My organization provides sufficient support fo r maintaining work -life balance" 
scored a mean of 3.0, also interpreted as "Neutral." This indicates a lack of consensus regarding organizati onal 
support, such as flexible work schedules, leave options, or well -being programs, which are crucial for 
promoting work -life integration [26].The findings align with e xisting research highlighting the challenges 
healthcare professionals face in balancing their demanding work respon sibilities with personal commitments. 
Long and irregular working hours, coupled with the emotional and physical demands of nursing, are well -
documented barriers to achieving work -life balance [9]. These challenges may lead to reduced job satisfaction, 
increased stress, and potential burnout if not addressed ef fectively.  
Improving work -life balance requires targeted interventions from healthcare organizations. For example, 
offering flexible work arrangements, implementing wellness programs, and ensuring adequate staffing levels 
to reduce workload can help addres s these concerns. Supporting nurses in achieving a healthier balance 
between work and personal life is essential not only for their well -being but also for enhancing organizational 
outcomes, such as improved employee retention, higher productivity, and str onger organizational commitment 
[3]. 
Overall, the findings for Research Question 2 provide valuable insights into how nurses perceive their work -
life balance. While there  are areas of strength, such as the ability to balance work and personal life, there are 
also clear opportunities for improvement, particularly in terms of organizational support and personal time 
allocation. Addressing these areas will require concerted e fforts from both nurses and healthcare institutions to 
foster a more supportive work environment.  
Level Of Organiza tional Commitment Among Nurses in Level 2 Hospitals in Laguna  
Research Question 3 focuses on examining the level of organizational commitment  among nurses in Level 2 
hospitals in Laguna. Organizational commitment refers to the emotional attachment, sense of obligation, and 
perceived necessity that employees feel toward their organization. Understanding this commitment is critical 
as it influenc es employee performance, retention, and overall organizational effectiveness. By exploring the 
dimensions of affect ive commitment (emotional attachment), continuance commitment (cost of leaving), and 
normative commitment (sense of obligation), this questio n seeks to assess how nurses perceive their 
relationship with their organization. This exploration is essential in identifying factors that motivate nurses to 
stay committed to their roles, which is particularly important in the healthcare sector, where hi gh levels of 
stress and turnover are prevalent. Insights from this inquiry can guide strategies to foster stronger commitment 
and improve workplace satisfaction among nurses.

Table 7 reveals the level of organizational commitment among nurses, classified into three dimensions: 
affective, continuance, and normative commitment. The overall mean score of 4.01, int erpreted as "Agree," 
suggests that the respondents generally feel a positive connection and obligation to their organizations. 
Organizational commitment plays a vital role in influencing work behaviors, such as performance, job 
satisfaction, and retention.  The findings indicate that nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna pe rceive their 
commitment as strong across all dimensions, reflecting a healthy organizational rel ationship [3].The mean 
score of 4.15 for affective commitment, ranging from "Agree" to "Strongly Agree," demonstrates a significant 
emotional attachment to the organization among nurses. This dimension was the highest -rated among the three, 
with statements like "I feel a strong sense of belonging to my organization" (mean = 4.2)  and "I care about the 
future of this organization" (mean = 4.3) reflecting deep personal and professional bonds. These high scores 
suggest that nurses are motivated by a genuine connectio n to their organization’s mission and values, which 
likely enhances their engagement and performance. Research has shown that affective commitment correlates 
strongly with positive work outcomes, such as reduced absenteeism, higher job satisfaction, and gr eater 
organi zational citizenship behaviors [9]. 
The continuance commitment dimension scored a mean of 3.9, interpreted as "Agree." This finding highlights 
that nurses per ceive staying with their organization as beneficial due to the perceived costs of leaving, such as 
loss of benefits, professional stability, or career progression opportunities. Statements like "Leaving this 
organization would require significant personal sacrifice" (mean = 4.0) and "It would be difficult for me to 
leave t his organization, even if I wanted to" (mean = 3.9) underscore the role of practical considerations in 
organizational commitment. While continuance commitment ensures retention, it is ofte n driven by external 
factors rather than intrinsic motivation, making it essential for organizations to address these practical concerns 
while fostering af fective ties [26]. 
The mean score for normative commitment, 3.97 (Agree), reflects a strong sense of obligation among nurses to 
remain with their organization. Statements such as "I believe it is my duty to support my organization" (mean 
= 4.0) and "I feel loyalty to my organization because it has supported me" (mean = 4.1) suggest that nurses 
view their commitment as reciprocal. When organizations provide support, such as professional development 
opportunities, career growth, and emotional well -being resources, employees  feel morally responsible to stay 
loyal. Studies have found that nor mative commitment is positively associated with retention and reduces 
turnover intentions, particularly in professions like nursing, where trust and reciprocity are crucial [12]. 
The overall mean score of 4.01 indicates that nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna exhibit a balanced 
combination of affective, continuance, and normative commitment, all rated p ositively. The high level of

 affective commitment is particularly no table, as it suggests that many nurses are engaged and motivated by 
their emotional connection to their workplace. This emotional bond often translates into higher job satisfaction 
and a w illingness to go above and beyond their job requirements. At the same time, the presence of 
continuance and normative commitment indicates that both practical and moral considerations play roles in 
their decision to stay within the organization.  
These find ings have significant implications for hospital administrators and policymakers. To sustain and 
enhance organizational commitment, healthcare organizations should prioritize initiatives that address all three 
dimensions. Strengthening affective commitment may involve creating a positive work culture, promoting 
organizational pride, and aligning organizational goals with employees' personal values. To address 
continuance commitment, organizations could offer competitive benefits, job security, and  clear care er 
advancement pathways to reduce the perceived cost of leaving. Finally, normative commitment can be 
bolstered by fostering a sense of reciprocity through support systems, such as mentoring programs, 
professional development opportunities, and recognition  of employees' contributions.  While the results are 
promising, challenges such as high workload, stress, and resource limitations in healthcare settings can 
undermine organizational commitment if not addressed. Nurses often face demanding schedu les and emo tional 
exhaustion, which can erode their commitment over time. Addressing these issues by improving work -life 
balance, as highlighted in Research Question 2, can further reinforce organizational loyalty and satisfaction.  
In summary, the findings indicate t hat nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna possess a strong sense of 
organizational commitment, driven by emotional connection, practical considerations, and moral obligation. 
By leveraging these insights and addressing the challenges faced by nu rses, healt hcare organizations can foster 
a committed workforce that contributes to improved patient care, reduced turnover rates, and overall 
organizational success.  
Relationship Between Work -Life Balance and Organizational Commitment Among Nurses in Level 2 
Hospita ls in Laguna  
Research Question 4 investigates whether there is a significant relationship between work -life balance and 
organizational commitment among nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna. This question aims to explore how 
the ability to balance work res ponsibilities with personal life influences nurses' emotional attachment, 
perceived cost of leaving, and sense of obligation to their organization. The relationship between these 
variables is critical in understanding how organizational policies and indivi dual c oping strategies impact job 
satisfaction, performance, and retention. By examining this connection, the study seeks to provide valuable 
insights into the dynamics between work -life integration and workplace loyalty, offering evidence -based 
recommenda tions for fostering a supportive environment in healthcare settings.

The results in Table 8 indicate a significant positive relationship between work -life balance and organizational 
commitment among nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna. The overall correlation coe fficient (r = 0.62, p < 
0.001) suggests a moderate positive relationship, meaning that as nurses perceive better work -life balance, 
their overall organizational commitment increases.

 The strongest correlation is observed between work -life balance and affec tive commitment (r = 0.68, p < 
0.001). This indicates that nurses who are able to balance their work and personal responsibilities are more 
likely to feel an emotional attachment and sense of belonging to their organization. Research supports this 
finding,  as emotional well -being and job satisfaction are often linked to a supportive work environment that 
enables employee s to achieve work -life harmony [3]; [26]. Hospitals that offer flexible schedules or resources 
to support work -life balance can enhance this emotional bond, fostering a stronger commitment to the 
organization.A weaker but s till significant correlation is found between work -life balance and continuance 
commitment (r = 0.45, p < 0.001). This suggests that while work -life balance does influence the practic al or 
financial reasons nurses stay with their organization, the relation ship is not as strong as for affective or 
normative commitment. Continuance commitment often stems from external factors, such as job security or 
benefits, rather than personal satisfaction, which may explain the weaker correlation (Creswell & Creswell, 
2018). 
The correlation between work -life balance and normative commitment (r = 0.59, p < 0.001) reflects a moderate 
positive relationship, indicating that nurses who experience better work -life balance are more likely to feel a 
moral obligation to remain wit h their organization. This could be due to organizational support mechanisms, 
such as flexible work arrangements or wellness programs, which foster a sense of loyalty and reciprocity. 
Employees are more likely to remain committed to organizations that prio ritize their well -being and personal 
needs [9]. 
The overall correlation highlights the importance of work -life balance as a factor influencing organizational 
commitment. Nurses who perceive a better balance between their work and personal lives are more likely to 
develop a stronger emotional connection, recognize the practical benefits of staying, and feel a sense of loyalty 
to their organization. These findings align with  existing research, which emphasizes that work -life balance not 
only improves job satisfaction but also contributes to higher retention rates and reduced burnout in the 
health care sector [26]. Healthcare organizations can leverage these findings by implementing policies and 
programs that promote work -life balance. Providing flexible work hours, mental health resources, and family 
support programs can enhance nurses' percep tions of balance, ultimately strengthening their organizational 
commitment. By prioritizing work -life balance, hospitals can reduce turnover, improve employee satisfaction, 
and ensure consistent quality care for patients.  
In conclusion, the study confirms that work -life balance significantly influences organizational commitment, 
particularly in terms of emotional attachment and moral obligation. By addressing the work -life needs of 
nurses, healthcare organizations can create a supportive environment that fo sters loyalty and commitment, 
benefiting both employees and the institution as a whole.  
Relationship Between Nurses' Perception of Work -Life Balance and Organizational Commitment When 
Grouped According to the Demographic Profile  
Research Question 5 explore s whether the relationship between work -life balance and organizational 
commitment varies based on the demographic profile of nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna. By examining 
demographic factors such as age, sex, marital status, years of service, and cu rrent position, this question aims 
to uncover potential differences in how nurses perceive and experience the interplay between their work -life 
balance and organizational commitment. These variations can pr ovide valuable insights into how individual 
charac teristics influence workplace dynamics and employee retention. Understanding these nuances is critical 
for developing targeted strategies and policies that cater to the unique needs of diverse groups within the 
nursing workforce, ultimately enhancing both employee satisfaction and organizational outcomes.

Table 4 provides a detailed analysis of the relationship between work -life balance and organizational 
commitment across different demographic groups of nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna. The results 
highlight how demographic factors such as age, sex, marital status, years of service, and current position 
influence the strength of this relationship, offering valuable insights into the varying experiences and needs of 
nurses in the workforce.  
The relationship between work -life balance and organizati onal commitment is strongest among younger nurses 
aged 21 –30 years (r = 0.65, p < 0.001) compared to those in older age groups. This strong correlation suggests 
that younger nurses place a higher emphasis on achieving work -life balance, which significantly  impacts their 
commitment to the organization. Younger nurses are often at the early stages of their careers, navigating new 
professional responsibilities alongside personal aspirations, such as purs uing further education, developing 
relationships, or star ting families. The findings align with research indicating that younger employees tend to 
prioritize flexible work conditions and personal fulfilment  when evaluating their commitment to an 
organization (Polit & Beck, 2017). For nurses aged 41 and above, th e correlation weakens (r = 0.48, p < 
0.001), reflecting a possible shift in priorities as they become more accustomed to their roles or focus more on 
financial stability and long -term career achievem ents. Older nurses may have developed coping mechanisms t o 
balance work and personal life, making their organizational commitment less dependent on perceived work -
life balance [3]. 
Both male (r = 0.62, p < 0.001) and female nur ses (r = 0.60, p < 0.001) show moderate positive correlations, 
indicating that work -life balance is equally important in influencing organizational commitment across 
genders. This finding is consiste nt with global trends in nursing, where both male and fem ale professionals are 
increasingly seeking environments that allow them to balance their demanding work responsibilities with 
personal well -being. While the nursing profession has historically been dominated by women, the growing 
presence of men in the fie ld highlights the universal need for wor k-life integration [9]. For both sexes, 
achieving work -life balance can l ead to increased satisfaction and loyalty, suggesting tha t healthcare 
organizations should adopt inclusive policies and programs that address the shared challenges faced by all 
nurses, regardless of gender.  
Among the demographic factors, marital status reveals notable differences in the strength of the relations hip 
between work -life balance and organizational commitment. Single nurses exhibit the highest correlation (r = 
0.68, p < 0.001), suggesting that their ability to balance work and personal life plays  a critical role in shaping 
their commitment to the organ ization. Single nurses may have more opportunities to focus on personal growth 
and leisure activities, making their perception of work -life balance particularly impactful. In contrast, married 
nurses (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and widowed or separated nurses (r  = 0.40, p = 0.02) show weaker correlations. 
Married nurses may face additional family responsibilities that influence their ability to achieve work -life 
balance, while widowed or separated nurses ma y encounter unique challenges that complicate their workp lace 
experiences. These findings suggest that marital status significantly shapes how nurses perceive and prioritize 
work -life balance, highlighting the importance of tailored interventions to address the varying needs of these 
groups (Creswell & Creswell,  2018).  
The relationship between work -life balance and organizational commitment is strongest among nurses with 
less than 5 years of service (r = 0.70, p < 0.001). This finding underscores the critic al role of work -life balance 
INTERNATIONAL  JOURNAL  OF RESEARCH  AND  INNOVATION  IN APPLIED  SCIENCE  (IJRIAS)

 for early -career professiona ls who are still establishing themselves in their roles. For these nurses, achieving a 
sense of balance can enhance their commitment and motivate them to remain with the organization. As years 
of service increase, the correlation weakens, with nurses havin g more than 10 years of service showing a 
weaker correlation (r = 0.50, p < 0.001). This pattern suggests that experienced nurses may have developed 
strategies to manage work -life demands or rely mor e on factors such as job security and professional 
relati onships to maintain their organizational commitment. The findings emphasize the need for healthcare 
organizations to provide robust support systems for early -career nurses to foster long -term retention and 
satisfaction (Polit & Beck, 2017).  
Staff nurses de monstrate a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.62, p < 0.001) between work -life balance and 
organizational commitment, indicating that their ability to balance personal and professional responsibil ities 
significantly influences their loyalty to the organ ization. This finding is expected, as staff nurses typically face 
high workloads and irregular schedules, making work -life balance a crucial determinant of their overall 
satisfaction. For head nurses (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and nursing supervisors (r = 0.49,  p < 0.001), the correlation 
weakens slightly, likely due to the increased administrative and leadership responsibilities associated with 
these roles. Higher -level positions often come with additiona l demands that may limit the ability to achieve a 
work -life balance, necessitating targeted support to ensure these professionals remain committed to their 
organizations (Bryman, 2016).  
The findings from Research Question 5 highlight the nuanced ways in which demographic factors shape the 
relationship between wo rk-life balance and organizational commitment. Younger nurses, single nurses, and 
those with fewer years of service show stronger correlations, underscoring the importance of providing flexible 
work arrangements, career development opportunities, and welln ess programs to address their needs. For older 
nurses, married nurses, and those in leadership roles, stress management initiatives and workload redistribution 
can help mitigate the challenges they face in maintaining work -life balance.  
By understanding th ese demographic -specific variations, healthcare organizations can implement targeted 
interventions to enhance work -life balance across all employee groups. Such initiatives not only improve 
organizat ional commitment but also foster a supportive work enviro nment that promotes employee 
satisfaction, retention, and productivity. The findings also emphasize the importance of inclusivity in policy 
design, ensuring that the unique needs of diverse demographic groups are addressed effectively.  
In conclusion, the s tudy reveals that the relationship between work -life balance and organizational 
commitment varies across demographic profiles, reflecting the diverse experiences and priorities of nurses in 
Level 2 h ospitals in Laguna. These insights can guide the developm ent of tailored strategies to support a 
committed and satisfied workforce, ultimately benefiting both the employees and the healthcare institution.

The Work -Life Balance and Commitment Enhancement Program (WLBCEP)  is specifically designed to 
address the key findings of the study. The program targets critical areas identified in the research, such as the 
need for flexible scheduling, emotional  support, and stress management, to improve work -life balance and 
organizational commitment.  
The first objective focuses on establishing flexible work schedules and wellness programs during the initial 
three months. Flexible scheduling accommodates nurses’  diverse needs based on their demographic profiles, 
while wellness programs, such as fitness activities and nutrition counseling, aim to enhance their overall well -
being. These initiatives align with findings from [26], which emphasize the importance of supportiv e work 
environments in improving organizational outcomes.  
The second objective involves strengthening emotional attachment and loyalty through team -building activi ties 
and recognition programs. By fostering camaraderie and appreciating employees’ contributions, these activities 
aim to boost affective commitment, as highligh ted by [3]. Recognition programs, such as awarding outstanding 
nurses, also reinforce a sense of belo nging and pride in the organization.  Stress -reduction initiatives are 
prioritized in the third phase. Free counseling sessions and mindfulness workshops are includ ed to address the 
moderate levels of stress reported by respondents. These activities provide nurses with coping mechanisms to 
manage professional demands, ensuring that work -life balance remains sustainable in the long term [9]. 
Finally, the program includes an evaluation phase, where surveys and focus group discussions assess its 
effectiveness. By gathering feedback, the organization can identify successful elements and areas for 
improvement, ensuring that the program evolves to meet the nurses’ needs.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
This study aimed to explore the rela tionship between work -life balance and organizational commitment among 
nurses working in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna. It specifically sought to determine the demog raphic profile of 
the respondents, assess their perceptions of work -life balance and organizational commitment, examine the 
relationship between these two variables, and evaluate whether demographic factors influenced this 
relationship. The study also aime d to propose actionable outputs based on its findings . The findings revealed 
that the majori ty of the respondents were aged 31 –40, predominantly female, married, with 5 –10 years of 
service, and holding staff nurse positions. Nurses generally perceived the ir work -life balance to be moderate, 
with higher satisfaction in balancing work and personal life but lower satisfaction in organizational support for 
achieving balance. They also exhibited strong organizational commitment, particularly in affective (emoti onal 
attachment) and normative (sense of obligation) dimensions, while continuance commitment  (perceived cost of 
leaving) was slightly weaker.A significant moderate positive correlation was found between work -life balance 
and organizational commitment, ind icating that better work -life balance is associated with stronger 
organizational commitment. This relationship varied across demographic profiles, with younger nurses, single 
nurses, and those with fewer years of service showing stronger correlations, emph asizing the need for tailored 
interventions.Based on the findings, the Work -Life Balance and Commitment Enhancement Program 
(WLBCEP) was proposed. This program includes flexible scheduling, wellness programs, team -building 
activities, stress -reduction init iatives, and evaluation mechanisms to address the identified needs and improve 
organizational outcomes. The study underscores the importance of fostering work -life balance to strengthen 
organizational commitment, particularly in high -stress professions lik e nursing. By addressing the unique

Discussion  
This study concludes that work -life balance plays a crucial role in influencing organizational commit ment 
among nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna. This study aimed to explore the relationshi p between work -life 
balance and organizational commitment among nurses working in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna. It specifically 
sought to determine the demographic profile of the respondents, assess their perceptions of work -life balance 
and organizational commitment, examine the relationship between these two variables, and evaluate whether 
demographic factors influenced this relationship. The study also aimed to pr opose actionable outputs based on 
its findings.  Using a quantitative research approach, data were collected through a structured survey 
questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised sections on demographic profile, a Work -Life Balance Scale, and 
an Organizati onal Commitment Scale, all measured using a 5 -point Likert scale. Statistical methods such as 
descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation analysis, and subgroup analysis were employed to address the 
research questions systematically.  The findings reveale d that the majority of the respondents were aged 31 –40, 
predominantly female, married, with 5 –10 years of service, and holding staff nurse positions. Nurses generally 
perceived their work -life balance to be moderate, with higher satisfaction in balancing w ork and personal life 
but lower satisfaction in organizational support for achieving balance. They also exhibited strong 
organizational commitment, particularly in affective (emotional attachment) and normative (sense of 
obligation) dimensions, while conti nuance commitment (perceived cost of leaving) was slightly weaker.  A 
significant moderate pos itive correlation was found between work -life balance and organizational 
commitment, indicating that better work -life balance is associated with stronger organizat ional commitment. 
This relationship varied across demographic profiles, with younger nurses, single nurses, and those with fewer 
years of service showing stronger correlations, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions.  Based on the 
findings, the Wor k-Life Balance and Commitment Enhancement Program (WLBCEP) was proposed. This 
program include s flexible scheduling, wellness programs, team -building activities, stress -reduction initiatives, 
and evaluation mechanisms to address the identified needs and imp rove organizational outcomes. The study 
underscores the importance of fostering work -life balance to strengthen organizational commitment,

 particularly in high -stress professions like nursing. By addressing the unique needs of nurses across different 
demog raphic groups, healthcare organizations can create supportive environments that enhance emplo yee 
satisfaction, reduce turnover, and improve the quality of patient care. These findings provide a foundation for

professionals.  
CONCLUSION  
This study concludes that work -life balance plays a crucial role in influencing organizational commitment 
among nurses in Level 2 hospitals in Laguna. The findings revealed tha t nurses generally perceive their work -
life balance as moderate, with strengths in managing p ersonal and professional responsibilities but challenges 
in organizational support for achieving balance. Organizational commitment was found to be strong, 
particu larly in terms of emotional attachment (affective commitment) and moral obligation (normative 
commitment), while practical considerations (continuance commitment) showed slightly weaker associations.  
A significant positive correlation between work -life bal ance and organizational commitment indicates that 
nurses who perceive better work -life balanc e are more likely to exhibit stronger organizational commitment. 
Furthermore, this relationship varies across demographic profiles, with younger nurses, single nur ses, and 
those with fewer years of service showing stronger correlations. These variations highlight the need for 
targeted interventions to address the unique needs of different groups within the nursing workforce.  The study 
emphasizes the importance of fo stering a supportive work environment that enhances work -life balance, as it 
directly impacts  nurses' loyalty and satisfaction within their organizations. Programs such as the proposed 
Work -Life Balance and Commitment Enhancement Program (WLBCEP) can provi de practical solutions to 
address these needs, including flexible scheduling, wellness initiatives, and stress -reduction strategies. By 
implementing such interventions, healthcare organizations can reduce turnover, improve job satisfaction, and 
ensure bett er patient care outcomes.  In conclusion, addressing the interplay between work -life balance a nd 
organizational commitment is vital for maintaining a satisfied and committed nursing workforce, contributing 
to the overall success and sustainability of health care institutions.
