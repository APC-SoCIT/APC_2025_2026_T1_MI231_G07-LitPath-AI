ABSTRACT
This study aimed to determine the consumer acceptability and perceptions for
brown rice among household heads in selected barangays in Caloocan City. The
study employed a multimethod design utilizing quantitative and qualitative
phases. The quantitative phase included a face-to-face interview (survey) on the
basic sociodemographic and economic profiles of the household heads, self-
administered knowledge assessment, and consumer acceptability test of the
sensory attributes of brown rice. The qualitative phase included the conduct of
focus group discussions (FGDs) discussing major themes that affect brown rice
consumption among Filipinos. A total of 584, 104, and 176 respondents
participated in the survey, consumer acceptability test, and FGDs, respectively.
This research has been reviewed and approved by the UP Manila Research Ethics
Board (UPMREB) - Ethics Review Panel via expedited review on 20 January 2017

with study protocol code: UPMREB 2016-403-01.

The study revealed that the acceptability of brown rice was lower as compared to
white rice, with significant mean differences in the consumer acceptability of the
sensory attributes and the overall acceptability of brown rice (p<0.0001).
Knowledge scores on the nutritional properties of brown rice and its attributes were
low, with mean score of 53.7 percent. When the different covariates were tested
for significance, it was revealed that price, color and appearance, and taste were
all associated with the overall acceptability of brown rice among consumers.
Specifically, the odds of acceptability of brown rice were 11 times higher if the

consumer liked the color and appearance of rice (OR= 10.76, 95%CI: 2.50; 46.27),

wv

20 times higher if the consumer liked the taste of rice (OR= 19.80; 95%CI: 2.99;
131.15), and 10 times higher when price was acceptable to the consumer (OR=
21.29; 95%CI: 3.87; 117.25). On the other hand, other factors associated with the
acceptability of brown rice as based on the qualitative FGDs were awareness of
the nutritional properties of brown rice, availability of brown rice in local wet
markets, familiarity with brown rice, and the acceptability of brown rice to other

family members, among others

Keywords: brown rice, consumer acceptability, FGDs

CHAPTER!
INTRODUCTION

‘A. Background of the Study

Rice is a staple food in many parts of the world especially across Asia
(Rohman et al., 2014). It is synonymous with food and nutrition security throughout
Asia and rice production is one of the most important economic activities in the
world. In 2010, rice production totaled to 696 million metric tons (MMT) (GRISP,
2013). Current global milled rice utilization is at 480 million metric tons per annum,

with over 85 percent for human consumption (Muthayya et al., 2014),

In Asian countries, at least 30 percent of caloric intake comes from rice
(GRiSP, 2013). The latest National Nutrition Survey (NNS) in 2014 conducted by
the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and
Technology (FNRI-DOST) in the Philippines showed that cereal and cereal
products (majority of which is rice) constitutes 40.3 percent of the daily household
consumption. Furthermore, at least 1 cup and 2 % tablespoons (220 g) of rice is
eaten by Filipinos per meal at the individual level (FNRI-DOST, 2014). It can
therefore be concluded that rice plays an important role in the diet of Filipinos.
However, majority of consumers still prefer white rice, with the consumption and
preference for brown rice and other whole grain foods remaining at relatively lower

levels compared to their milled counterparts (Pabuayon and Quilloy, 2011)

Rice preferences vary from country to country and across cultures (Galawat

and Yabe, 2010). Since the advent of modern milling technologies which produces

al

well-polished rice or white rice, the affinity for brown rice reduced drastically.
Today, the most commonly consumed type of rice is white rice, which has a whiter
texture and longer shelf-life compared to brown rice. Production of brown rice
involves minimal milling and processing as compared to white rice. In brown rice,
only the hull is removed and the bran layer is retained which gives it its
characteristic brown color wherein in white rice, the bran layer is removed to
produce polished grains. When rice is milled, an average of 60 percent of the
nutrient content is lost since majority of these can be found in the bran layer
(Danquah and Egyir, 2014). Brown rice is a good source of dietary fiber, along with
other nutrients such as thiamin, niacin, phosphorus and calcium in addition to

carbohydrates (FNRI-DOST, 2011).

Due to the reduced nutrient content, consumption of white rice has been
shown to be associated with risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
such as an increase in body mass index (BMI) in duplicate homogeneous groups
studied by Kim et al. (2012) (group 1 OR=1.16, 95% Cl: 1.04, 1.30; and group 2
OR=1.19, 95% Cl: 1.06, 1.33), which is an indicator for overnutrition. Consumption
of white rice has also been found to be associated with NCDs such as type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary heart disease, and ischemic stroke. In a meta-
analysis on the association of white rice consumption and the risk of T2DM, the
random effects model summarizing the comparisons suggested a positive
association (pooled RR=1.27, 95% Cl: 1.04, 1.54) between white rice consumption
and the risk of T2DM (Hu et al., 2012). Regular white rice consumption has also

been associated with coronary heart diseases (HR=1.80, 95% Cl: 1.01, 3.17) and

2

ischemic stroke (adjusted OR=2.73, 95% Cl: 1.31, 5.69), among others (Yu et al.,

2013; Liang et al., 2013).

B. Statement of the Problem

This study aimed to answer the research problem: “What is the consumer

acceptability and perceptions for brown rice among household heads in selected

barangays in Caloocan City?”

Sub-problems include the following:

1.

What is the level of acceptability of cooked brown rice among household
heads?
What is the difference in the level of acceptability of brown rice as compared

to white rice among household heads?

. What is the level of knowledge on the nutritional properties and attributes of

brown rice among household heads?

Are the following factors associated with the acceptability of brown rice

among household heads:

a. Attributes of brown rice (sensory attributes, cost, ease of preparation);

b. Individual characteristics (knowledge on the nutritional properties of
brown rice, customs/tradition, health consciousness), and

c. Household characteristics (household income, household size, daily
food expenditure)?

What are the consumer perceptions for brown rice among household

heads?

ho

C. Objectives of the Study

The general objective of the study was to determine the consumer acceptability

and perceptions for brown rice among household heads in selected barangays in

Caloocan City

Specifically, the study aimed to:

1

determine the level of acceptability of cooked brown rice among household

heads;

. compare the level of acceptability of brown rice and white rice among

household heads;

. determine the level of knowledge on the nutritional properties and attributes

of brown rice among household heads;

. determine if the following factors are associated with the acceptability of

brown rice among household heads:

a. Attributes of brown rice (sensory attributes, cost, ease of preparation);

b. Individual characteristics (knowledge on the nutritional properties of
brown rice, customs/tradition, health consciousness); and

c. Household characteristics (household income, household size, daily

food expenditure)

. determine the consumer perceptions for brown rice among household

heads.

D. Significance of the Study

Brown rice consumption has been promoted in the Philippines to help
alleviate the increasing rate of overnutrition and increasing prevalence of NCDs in
the early 2000s. Despite the different promotional activities conducted, such as the
National Brown Rice Day set by the Department of Agriculture (DA), and other
public and private initiatives, brown rice consumption is still minimal among
Filipinos. Average monthly consumption was 6.75 kilograms but majority of the
brown rice consumers did not use brown rice exclusively (Pabuayon and Quilloy,
2011). Local studies on ascertaining the factors affecting brown rice consumption
are not available. While the health benefits of the consumption of brown rice have
already been established, understanding the underlying social, behavioral,
cultural, economic and other factors affecting brown rice consumption is vital.

Significance for the different benefactors are enumerated below.

For the policy makers. This study would help establish baseline data on
acceptability of brown rice among the consumers. It will further aid in
drafting policies and ordinances targeting promotion of healthy food choices
among consumers. Promotion of the consumption of healthier food choices
such as brown rice may be made more specific to target different
sociocultural determinants in the population which prevents its
consumption. Allocation of funds may become more effective since target
populations and age groups may be characterized more deeply and actions

may be made more specific to these populations.

In

For the researchers. Agencies that aim to develop brown rice to increase
its acceptability can use the data to target specific attributes of brown rice
which makes it less acceptable than white rice. Blind spots on the lack of
local and current acceptability studies may be filled in by the study and

direction of research may be more clearly defined.

For health professionals. Promotion of brown rice may help the
consumers become more aware on healthy food choices wherein balance,
variety, and moderation are also taken into consideration. Promotion of
healthier behavior, such as choosing brown rice over white rice, would
eventually lead to the regular consumption of healthy food items that may
help prevent diseases in the future. This would in turn help alleviate the
double burden of malnutrition of the country. Furthermore, since brown rice
has higher fiber and nutrient content, it can also help alleviate overnutrition
and NCDs. Decreased prevalence and risk for NCDs may divert funds for
other health problems of the society. On the other hand, due to its high
satiety value, brown rice can also extend fullness and therefore target
hunger in the population with limited resources. Furthermore, its high
nutritional value can help prevent specific micronutrient deficiencies which
are also usual in the indigent populations. This may help in finally
decreasing the prevalence of undernutrition in the country, in which nutrition

funds are highly allocated.

roy

For the consumers. Brown rice has been proven to have protective and
preventive effects from NCDs, which is a growing concern in the Philippines,
and also in most developing and developed countries today. Due to its high
fiber content and high satiety effects, brown rice may also help prevent
hunger among marginalized individuals. The promotion of the consumption
of healthier food alternatives, such as brown rice, would help the consumers
become more aware of the benefits of choosing healthy foods and eating in

moderation, thus enhancing their behavior towards healthy diet in the future.

CHAPTER Il
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

A. Review of Related Literature
2.1. Rice

Rice (Oryza sativa) is a dietary staple food and one of the most important
cereal crops, especially for people in Asia (Rohman et al., 2014). Thousands of
rice varieties are farmed and rice is closely associated with food and nutrition
security for a vast majority of populations living in the developing world (Muthayya
et al., 2014). Rice production is one of the most important economic activities

globally and in 2010, rice production totaled 696 million tons (GRiSP, 2013).

Production of rice involves three major phases: pre-planting, growth, and
postproduction (Figure 2.1). The pre-planting stage involves choosing rice variety
to be planted, preparation of the crop calendar and land preparation. The second
stage, growth, is the stage where rice is planted, grown, and other extrinsic factors
such as weeds and pests are managed. Finally, post-production involves

harvesting and post-harvest activities to prepare the product for the market.

Figure 2.1 Step-by-step production of rice (IRRI, 2016)

Terms used in the milling of rice (Figure 2.2):

Rough rice. Also called paddy rice, is the individual rice kernels in their natural,

unprocessed state.

Hull. Also called husk; is the outer covering of a fruit or seed, in this instance, the

outer covering of the rice kernel.

Brown rice. Also called un-milled, under-polished, or raw rice; is a form of rice in
its unprocessed state wherein only the hull is removed and the bran layer is
retained.

Bran. Bran is the hard outer layer of the cereal grain where most nutrients are

found.

Milled rice. Also called polished, well-milled or white rice, is the most common form
of rice at the present wherein the bran layer is removed to produce its final white

or polished form.

Figure 2.2 The milling process of rice

The final process in the postproduction stage is milling and processing in
which rough rice undergoes to produce the most commonly sold type of rice in the
market, which is white rice. Milling is a crucial step in the post-production of rice.
The basic objective of a rice milling system is to remove the husk and the bran
layers, and produce an edible, white rice kernel that is sufficiently milled and free
of impurities (IRRI, 2016). The milling stage determines the type of rice (white rice
or brown rice) that will be sold in the market. Milling white rice removes 38 percent
of the husk compared to milling brown rice which only removes 28 percent
(Karunungan, 2015). Therefore, there is a ten percent higher milling recovery in
brown rice compared to white rice, meaning that higher yield can be expected from
brown rice production due to both the retention of the bran layer and the prevention

of damaging the grain due to milling processes.

The by-products of milling and processing includes the husk and bran layer
which are utilized for other purposes. Rice husks are usually used as bedding

materials, and as source of energy. In the modern rice milling industry, rice husks

10

are increasingly being used as a fuel source for grain drying and parboiling, and
for electricity generation (IRRI, 2016). On the other hand, because of the high
nutritive value and oil content of the bran layer, it is commonly used as binder for
animal feeds, vegetable oil for human consumption or as waxes for cosmetics
(IRRI, 2016). However, in the developing countries, rice bran is underutilized due

to a lack of suitable stabilization techniques (IRRI, 2016).

2.1.1. Brown rice

Brown rice or “pinawa’ in Filipino is the original form of rice consumed by
Filipinos even before the 1950s, but the advent of modern technologies for
milling resulted in lower consumption of brown rice and brown rice being
regarded as dirty rice (ARF, 2001). Despite its dirty appearance, brown rice is
healthier compared to white rice since the bran layer is conserved. The bran
layer contains most of the nutrients and fatty acids of the rice grain. Therefore,
the distinctive characteristic of brown rice is not its brown color, but the
unpolished feature. Thus, any variety of rice can be called brown rice, as long

as it only underwent minimal milling and processing

Due to its nutritional value, brown rice has been utilized in several
intervention studies, the most prominent is the Bataan Rice Enrichment Project
in 1952, which recommends the use of brown rice, due to its high nutritional
content (especially B-vitamin content), for the cure of beriberi in the Philippines
(Quiogue, 1952). The bran layer of rice is also the material used for the

production of “Tiki Tiki", an anti-beriberi drug avaitable until the present.

Brown rice contains higher amounts of nutrients and fiber compared to white
tice. When rice is milled, an average of 60 percent (Figure 2.3) of the nutrient
content is lost since majority of these nutrients can be found in the bran layer.
Based from the data in the 1997 Philippine Food Composition Tables (FCT),
brown rice contains higher nutrient and fiber content compared to white rice
(Table 2.1). Furthermore, in the study by Juliano in 2013, it was revealed that
local varieties of brown rice contain higher antioxidant content, specifically
Vitamin E, as compared to white rice (Table 2.2).

2.1.2. Local availability of brown rice

Brown rice costs less to produce since minimal processing is necessary in
its production. However, the low demand and constraints of brown rice (i.e.,
shorter shelf life due to higher fat content) make it more expensive compared
to white rice. Brown rice is only popular among well-informed, middle-class

professionals, but not the vast majority of Filipinos (Santiaguel, 2013).

Based from the study by Pabuayon and Quilloy in 2011 on the brown rice
market chains in Luzon, Philippines, there are only ten major producers of
brown rice in the country, and Nueva Ecija is the main producer based from the
volume of production. The annual output of the ten producers was
approximately 397 metric tons only. The geographical flow of brown rice largely
depends on the volume of production and the consumer demand. The study
of brown rice market chains in Luzon also concluded that brown rice reached
consumers through retailers such as super/hypermarkets and
specialized/health shops, which limits the availability of brown rice in local
markets and stores. Since prices at supermarkets are higher, consumers are
better off with the relatively cheaper brown rice they get from their present

sources (Pabuayon and Quilloy, 2011)

2.1.3. Allergic reactions to brown rice
Despite the higher nutritional quality of brown rice. the retention of the bran
layer translates to higher chances of having allergic components. Various

proteins (albumins, amylase/trypsin inhibitors, profilin, and glyoxalase) are

44

responsible for brown rice allergic reactions (Steinman, 2012). Although not
usual, several cases of brown rice allergy have been reported especially where
rice consumption is high. Rice allergy is more common in infants and children
since the gastrointestinal tract is still at the early stages of development. Brown
rice allergy through ingestion is not common as compared to inhalation, but
several symptoms of allergic reactions to brown rice ingestion include
abdominal cramping and similar pain, nausea, and vomiting (Steinman, 2012).
Brown rice also contains lectins. Lectins may attach themselves to components
of various cells, such as the cells that line the wall of the intestines and may
result to a variety of problems, including allergic reactions (Zimmermann,

2013)

2.2. Rice consumption

Rice consumption is highest in Asia, but the consumption outside Asia has
increased recently (Rohman et al., 2014). In Asian countries, at least 30 percent
of the caloric intake comes from rice (Figure 2.4). However, the most common type
of rice consumed is white rice, which is relatively less healthy than brown rice.
Locally, the latest NNS results showed that a total of 40.3 percent of the daily
household consumption comes from cereals and cereal products, majority of which
is rice (Table 2.3 and Figure 2.5). The important role of rice in the diet of Filipinos
and other rice-consuming countries cannot be undermined and therefore,
promoting healthier forms of rice may determine the nutritional status of the

consumers.

2.3. Rice consumption and disease

The milling of rice removes most of its nutrients including its dietary fiber
content. Due to this, white rice consumption has been associated with NCDs and
their risk factors such as T2DM; obesity or high body mass index (BMI); coronary
heart disease (CHD); and ischemic stroke (Hu et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2012; Yu et

al., 2013; Liang et al., 2013).

2.3.1. Obesity

White rice consumption has been found to be associated with obesity in a
cross-sectional study by Kim et al. (2012) among South Korean adults. The
results revealed that a diet of white rice and “kimchi” (caloric intake coming
mostly from white rice and kimchi) was positively associated with the risk of
obesity in the two similar groups (group 1 OR=1.16, 95% Cl: 1.04, 1.30; group
2 OR=1.19, 95% Cl: 1.06, 1.33).

2.3.2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus

Hu et al. (2012) conducted a meta-analysis to determine the association of
white rice consumption with the risk of T2DM which included seven prospective
cohort studies from Western and Asian countries. Pooled data suggest that
white rice consumption is associated with an elevated risk of T2DM (pooled
RR=1.27, 95% Cl: 1.04, 1.54). This association is stronger and significant only
for Asian (Chinese and Japanese) populations (pooled RR=1.55, 95% Cl: 1.20,
2.01) as compared to Western populations (pooled RR=1.12, 95% Cl: 0.94,
1.33), suggesting a relationship between rice intake and ethnicity. The dose-
Tesponse analysis showed that consumption of one serving per day of white
rice was associated with an 11 percent increase in risk of diabetes in the overall

population.

2.3.3. Cardiovascular diseases

Several studies have been conducted to ascertain the association of white
rice consumption and cardiovascular diseases and its risk factors. In a
prospective cohort study among Chinese adults, results revealed that diets with
higher calories coming from white rice have an association with CHD risk
(pooled HR=1.80, 95% Cl: 1.01, 3.17) (Yu et al., 2013). Another study among
Southern Chinese adults revealed that the increasing the consumption of
cooked rice was associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke (adjusted
OR=2.73, 95% Cl: 1.31, 5.69) (Liang et al., 2009). Conflicting results were
presented in a cross-sectional study by Khosravi-Boroujeni et al. (2013), which

revealed that there is no statistical difference in biomarkers of cardiovascular

18

diseases among males who were regular rice consumers (consumes white rice
7-14 times/week) and those who were not (consumes white rice less seven

times/week).

2.3.4. Brown rice consumption and disease

The major health benefit of brown rice besides its B-vitamin and vitamin E
content is its high dietary fiber content. While consumption of white rice is
closely linked to NCD risk factors, consumption of brown rice has been found

to be associated with decreased risk for NCDs.

In a randomized cross-over clinical trial by Kazemzadeh et al. (2013) among
overweight and obese adult Iranian women, substituting brown rice for white
tice for six weeks improved anthropometric characteristics showing reduction
in weight (mean difference=1.2kg, 95% Cl: 0.69, 1.96; p-value=0.001), waist
circumference (mean difference=2.38cm, 95% Cl: 0.51, 4.25; p-value=0.014),
hip circumference (mean difference=2.98cm, 95% Cl: 1.55, 4.44; p-
value<0.001), and BMI (mean difference=0.52kg/m?, 95% Cl: 0.26, 0.78; p-
value<0.001). Furthermore, inflammatory markers for heart disease (hsCRP
levels) decreased markedly in the brown rice group as compared to the white
rice group (mean difference=0.98mg/L, 95% Cl: 0.23, 1.73; p-value=0.012)

(Kazemzadeh et al., 2013).

In another randomized cross-over clinical trial (Mohan et al., 2014) among
Indian adults, replacement of white rice with brown rice in two meals per day

(breakfast and lunch) for five days resulted in a significantly lower glycemic

19

response (percent difference= -19.8, 95% Cl: -32.8, -6.7; p-value=0.004)
Better insulin response was also observed after brown rice consumption
compared to after white rice consumption (percent difference= -57, 95%

Cl: -84, -30; p-value=0.0001) (Mohan et al., 2014).

Local clinical trial among adult Filipinos with T2DM who consumed one cup
of brown rice per meal daily for eight weeks showed statistically significant
teduction in fasting blood sugar (FBS), random blood sugar (RBS), and BMI

from pre-test to post-test (p-values<0.05) (Gomez, 2015).

Despite these statistical associations, conflicting findings were revealed in
an intervention trial by Brownlee et al. (2010) and Zhang et al. (2011). In the
46-week randomized controlled trial in two groups (British adults) with different
amounts of whole grains, no evidence of changes on biomarkers of
cardiovascular health were observed in those who were given whole grains
compared to the control after the trial (p-values>0.05) (Brownlee et al., 2010).
On the other hand, in a randomized dietary intervention trial by Zhang et al.
(2011) among Chinese adults with T2DM, results showed no sufficient
evidence of differences in anthropometric and biochemical markers for T2DM

after substituting white rice with brown rice for 16 weeks (p-values>0.05).

2.4. Consumer acceptability of brown rice

Studies on the consumer acceptability of brown rice are limited and
comparison products are often varied, depending on locally available and
traditionally consumed products. This includes locally produced white rice, other
rice varieties and other cereals such as corn. Background of the panel members
also vary, with some studies having trained panelists and some having untrained
panelists. All of the studies concerning the acceptability of brown rice used
convenience sampling to attain the required population. Majority of the studies, on
the other hand, have small sample sizes which could have affected the results of

the study.

The results of the quantitative studies (Table 2.5) revealed that brown rice
is generally acceptable based on color and appearance, texture, taste, and overall
quality. However, ratings for brown rice were substantially lower than those of the
other carbohydrate sources such as white rice and majority of the studies showed
that white rice is still more preferred compared to brown rice (Sareepuang et al.,
2008; Sudha et al., 2013; Ebuehi and Oyewole, 2007; Muhihi et al., 2013; Shobana

et al., 2011; Monge-Rojas et al., 2014).

2.5. Consumer perceptions for rice

2.5.1. Elements of perception

Perception is the process of selecting, organizing, and interpreting
sensations into a meaningful whole (Hanna and Mozniak; 2013). The
development of perception led to a deeper understanding of human nature
resulting in viewing perception in a more holistic approach involving not only
using the five senses as basis but other elements as well. The elements of
perception according to Schiffman and Kanuk (2010) includes sensation,

absolute threshold, differential threshold, and subliminal perception.

Sensation is defined as the responses of a person's sensory receptors to
environmental stimuli and the transmission of this information to the brain via
the nervous system (Hanna and Mozniak; 2013). This includes the acquisition
of sensory information through the sense organs such as the eyes, ears,
mouth, nose, and skin. Individuals tend to rely more on visual cues and only
resort to the other senses when vision is unavailable (e.g., in the dark). During
food consumption, the brain receives different sensory inputs and the
information from physiologically distinct sensory modes is integrated in the final

sensory perception

Absolute threshold, on the other hand, is the lowest level at which an
individual can experience a sensation (Schiffman and Kanuk; 2010)
Introduction of new products using novel advertisements stimulate the absolute

threshold of an individual and therefore creates more impact compared to using

conventional methods. Consumers can allocate mental capacity to a stimulus

either planned, involuntary or spontaneous.

Differential threshold or just noticeable difference is the minimal difference
that can be detected between two similar stimuli (Schiffman and Kanuk, 2010).
The stronger the initial stimulus, the greater the additional intensity needed for
the second stimulus to be perceived as different. Negative aspects of the
product should not be readily discernible while positive changes should be

made more distinct so as to attract the attention of consumers.

Lastly, subliminal perceptions are stimuli that are too weak or too brief to be
consciously seen or heard (Schiffman and Kanuk, 2010). Despite some
evidence that subliminal stimuli may influence affective reactions, extensive
research has shown no evidence that subliminal advertising can cause

behavior changes

The perceived quality and price also influences consumer perceptions.
Perceived quality depends on intrinsic cues which concern the physical
characteristics of the product (color and appearance, taste, odor) while extrinsic
cues are aspects not part of the product but which define the quality of the
product such as brand name, reputation of manufacturer, and product source.
After assessing the perceived quality of a product, perceived price should
reflect the value of item. Reference prices are used as a basis for comparison

in judging the likeliness to buy the product.

Another factor affecting consumer perception is the perceived risk. This
refers to the degree of uncertainty perceived by the consumer as to the
consequences (outcome) of a specific purchase decision (Schiffman and
Kanuk, 2010). This does not only involve functional risk but also includes
physical, financial, social, psychological and time risks. In order to address this,
information on the product should be provided to the consumers along with
building of good reputation both of the product and the manufacturer to ensure

credibility of the product's function to the consumer.

2.5.2. Factors affecting acceptability of brown rice

Consumer preferences for rice vary from country to country (Galawat and
Yabe, 2010). Consumer response to a given food is mainly defined by: 1) a
sensory component, related with the sensory properties of the product; 2) an
affective component, responsible for positive or negative response towards a
product, 3) a cognitive component, coming from the knowledge and opinions
about a product; and 4) a behavioral component, involving intentions or actions,
defining how willing a consumer is to do something in certain situations (Costell
et al., 2010). The sensory component reflects an individual's sensory
perception of the product; the affective component summarizes the general
response a person has to a product: the cognitive component is related to the
information that a person has about a product and to his/her attitudes and
beliefs, while the behavioral component is related to an action or intention and
reflects the person's intentions about his/her future behavior (Costell et al.,

2010).

Several studies have ascertained several factors affecting acceptability of
rice which include attributes of brown rice (sensory attributes, cost, ease of
preparation), individual characteristics (knowledge of the nutritional properties
of brown rice, customs/tradition, health consciousness of an individual,
consumer perception), and household characteristics (household income,

household size, monthly expenditure on food) (Table 2.6).

2.5.2.1. Attributes of brown rice

2.5.2.1.1. Consumer acceptability of the sensory attributes of rice

In most acceptability studies, sensory attributes ultimately determine
the acceptability of brown rice. As discussed earlier, several studies showed
that brown rice was generally acceptable but ratings for brown rice were
substantially lower as compared to other common carbohydrate sources
(ie. sorghum, wheat, and others) (Sareepuang et al., 2008; Sudha et al.,
2013; Ebuehi and Oyewole, 2007; Muhihi et al., 2013; Shobana et al., 2011;
Monge-Rojas et al, 2014). Primary characteristics of brown rice not
acceptable to the respondents in different studies include appearance
(Sudha et al., 2013) and taste (Danso-Abbeam et al., 2012; Danquah and
Egyir, 2014). Focus group discussions (FGDs) also revealed that major
barriers in the consumption of brown rice is its different texture and ‘nutty’

flavor (Monge-Rojas et al., 2014; Phan et al. 2010; Kumar et al. 2011)

2.5.2.1.2. Cost of brown rice

In the study by Sudha et al. (2013), majority (92.4%) the participants
were willing to switch to brown rice if the cost was affordable. Several FGDs
conducted in different populations have also revealed that cost of brown

tice affects its acceptability and the consumers’ food choices.

2.5.2.1.3. Ease of preparation

Several qualitative studies have revealed that ease of preparation is
a major factor affecting acceptability of rice (Phan et al., 2010). In most
FGDs conducted determining factors affecting rice choices, ease of
preparation affects acceptability of brown rice as stated by the participants.
Despite this, less than half of the respondents in the study by Muhihi et al.

(2013) regarded ease of preparation as a factor affecting their food choices.

2.5.2.2. Individual characteristics

2.5.2.2.1. Knowledge on the nutritional properties of brown rice

A contributing factor to the low acceptability of brown rice is the lack
of familiarity and promotion of the nutritive value of brown rice (Danquah et
al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2011). Limited awareness of the
nutritional properties of brown rice resulted to lower acceptability scores
among Indian respondents (mean scores for sensory attributes=4.6-4.7
points out of 7 points, overall acceptability=4.9 points out of 7 points) (Sudha
et al., 2013). In contrast, higher knowledge on the nutritional properties of
brown rice resulted in higher sensory evaluation scores as exhibited in the

study by Shobana et al. (2011) which revealed a higher consumer rating for

31

the overall acceptability for brown rice (mean scores for sensory attributes=
5.3-9.5 points out of 12 points, overall acceptability=8.8-9.4 out of 12 points)
given that the panelists were more knowledgeable on the nutritional
properties and health benefits of brown rice since most had come from the

food sciences background.

These findings were supported by the FGD conducted by Kumar et
al. (2011) which stated that apart from color, size, texture, and habit,
another major barrier to the acceptance of brown rice was poor awareness
about its attributes and its nutritive properties. In contrast, in the FGD
conducted by Phan et al. (2010) among Vietnamese and American adults,
it was revealed that majority of the participants were aware that brown rice

contains better nutritional value compared to white rice.

2.5.2.2.2. Customsstradition

Tradition and history also play a major role in the perception of brown
rice, for example, Vietnamese participants regarded brown rice negatively
due to its association with a period of poverty in Vietnam (Phan et al., 2012;
Kumar et al. 2011). Participants from the studies by Kumar et al. (2011) and
Zhang et al. (2010) stated that until all household members were willing to
accept any of these new varieties of brown rice, it would be difficult to give
up the highly polished rice that people were used to eating. Similarly,
majority of the respondents from the study by Muhihi et al. (2013) regarded
customsitradition as a significant factor affecting their food choices. Similar

results were presented by Kumar et al. (2011) from FGDs conducted among

32

Indian adults which included traditional practices as a major deterrent in the

consumption of brown rice.

2.5.2.2.3. Health consciousness

Health consciousness directly affect acceptability and consumption
of brown rice. In several FGDs, it was revealed that self-proclaimed health
conscious individuals tend to have higher acceptability scores compared to
those who did not deem themselves as health conscious (Muhihi et al.,

2013).

2.5.2.2.4. Consumer perceptions

Consumer perception was directly associated with acceptability of
brown rice as revealed in several FGDs conducted in different populations

(Zhang et al., 2010; Phan et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2011).

2.5.2.3. Household characteristics

2.5.2.3.1. Household income

Household income was not found to be associated with brown rice
acceptability (p=0.648) in the study by Danso-Abbeam et al. (2012) but
contrasting results were presented by Danquah and Egyir (2014) which
revealed that the attributes of brown rice (price, color, taste, nutritional
value, texture), attributes of white rice (taste, color, nutritional value), and
socioeconomic characteristics of the respondent (income) are statistically
significant in explaining the share of brown rice to total rice consumption

using the Tobit regression model (p-value<0.0000).

2.5.2.3.2. Household size
In the study by Danso-Abbeam et al. (2012), it has been found out

that household size has a positive relationship with preference for rice

(p<0.0001)

2.5.2.3.3. Monthly food expenditure
The study by Danso-Abbeam et al. (2012) has also revealed that the
consumer's monthly expenditure on food had significant positive effects on

their preference for rice (p-value<0.0001).

The acceptability of brown rice is influenced by several factors such as
attributes of brown rice (sensory attributes, cost, ease of preparation), individual
characteristics (knowledge of the nutritional properties of brown tice,
customs/tradition, health consciousness of an individual), and household
characteristics (household income, household size, monthly expenditure on food)
as well as consumer perceptions (Figure 2.6). All these factors were ascertained
in the study quantitatively except for the consumer perceptions which was purely

qualitative and was not analyzed for association with the outcome.

Due to the inherent relationship of the outcome variable to forming a
behavior, the conceptual framework for this study was guided by the Theory of
Planned Behavior. The Theory of Planned Behavior suggests that behavior is
dependent on one’s intention to perform the behavior. Intention is determined by
an individual's attitude (beliefs and values about the outcome of the behavior) and
subjective norms (beliefs about what other people think the person should do or
general social pressure, and motivations to comply with the behavior) (Morris et
al., 2012). Based from the literature review, attitudes towards brown rice
consumption are influenced by the sensory attributes of brown rice, knowledge on
the nutritional properties of brown rice, and an individual's consumer perception.
Subjective norms include customsf/tradition, health consciousness, and ease of
preparation, which are influenced by extrinsic factors aside from individual

reasons.

Behavior is also determined by an individual's perceived behavioral control,
defined as an individual's perceptions of their ability or feelings of self-efficacy to
perform behavior (Morris et al., 2012). Perceived behavioral control is influenced
by the capacity of the consumer to perform the behavior which is influenced by the
socioeconomic characteristics such as household income, household size,

monthly expenditure on food, as well as the cost of brown rice

C. Operational definition of variables

Acceptability of brown rice (Outcome): Defined as the experience
characterized by an overall positive (e.g., approach in a pleasant) attitude or
response. This was measured by doing a sensory evaluation of different brown
tice samples (using a self-administered form) and asking the respondent to rate
the overall acceptability of brown rice a 9-point Hedonic scale (with “1” as ‘Dislike
extremely’ and "9" as ‘Like extremely’). The ratings of the panelists were
categorized as ‘Low acceptability’ for those with ratings between “1 — Dislike
extremely” to “5 — Neither like nor dislike”, and ‘High acceptability’ for those with
ratings between “6 — Like slightly” and “9 - Like extremely” for use in the logistic

regression analysis (Figure 2.7)

Consumer acceptability of the sensory attributes of brown rice (Exposure):
Refers to the acceptability of the physical characteristics of cooked brown rice such
as appearance, odor, taste, and texture. This was measured using a sensory
evaluation of different brown rice samples (self-administered) and asking the
respondent to rate the acceptability of the attributes using a 9-point Hedonic scale
(with “1” as ‘Dislike extremely’ and “9” as ‘Like extremely’). Acceptability of the
sensory attributes of brown rice was coded and analyzed as mean acceptability
scores. For the logistic regression analysis, consumer acceptability scores for the
sensory attributes were categorized as ‘Low acceptability’ for those with ratings
between “1 — Dislike extremely” to “5 — Neither like nor dislike", and ‘High
acceptability’ for those with ratings between “6 — Like slightly” and “9 — Like
extremely” (Table 2.7)

Table 2.7 Classification of the Hedonic ratings of the panelists for the consumer

Level of Acceptability Hedonic Rating
High level of acceptability 6-9 points
Low level of acceptability 1-5 points

Level of knowledge (Exposure): The proficiency of the individual on the basic
information on the nutritional properties, health benefits and attributes of brown
rice. An in-depth 15-item test questionnaire on the knowledge assessment was
self-administered by the respondents after the face-to-face interview (Form 1,

Appendix 3). Level of knowledge remained as a quantitative variable and was used

41

for analysis as percentage scores for the overall correct answers of the

respondents and percentage scores for each individual question.

Customs/tradition (Exposure): The environment of the respondent indicating the
decisions of the household members with regards brown rice consumption as well
as past experiences on brown rice. This was measured through a face-to-face
interview using Form 1 (Appendix 3) and included three questions such as
previous experience in tasting brown rice, willingness to substitute white rice with
brown rice, and negative experiences in eating brown rice. Customs/tradition was
categorized as supportive if answered at least two positive response on the three
questions under customs/tradition (e.g. ‘Yes’ to having previous experience in
tasting brown rice and willingness to substitute white rice with brown rice; and
answered ‘No’ to having negative experiences in eating brown rice), otherwise,

customs/tradition was classified as inhibitive (Table 2.8).

Table 2.8 Classification of the customs/tradition of the household heads with regards to

brown rice
Customs/tradition Classification Positive Answers
Supportive More than 2

Inhibitive Less than 2

Health consciousness (Exposure): Health consciousness is the self-declared
level of concem on health and nutrition of the respondent. This was asked during
the face-to-face interview and the respondent was categorized as ‘Health

conscious’ if answered ‘1 — Very Health Conscious’ or ‘2 — Health Consious’ to

question number 14 in Form 1 (Appendix 3), otherwise, the response was

classified as ‘Not health conscious’ (Table 2.9).

Ease of preparation (Exposure): Refers to the acceptability of brown rice to the
respondents based on the length of cooking time. This was measured by using a
self-administered questionnaire included in the sensory evaluation part wherein
the respondents were asked to rate the acceptability of brown rice based on ease
of preparation. Ratings were from 1 to 10, with 1 being the highest. Ratings for
ease of preparation were categorized as ‘Low acceptability’ for those with ratings
between 6 to 10, and ‘High acceptability’ for those with ratings between 1-5, for

utilization in the logistic regression analysis (Table 2.10).

Cost of brown rice (Exposure): Refers the affordability of the current price of

brown rice per kilogram in the market among the respondents. This was measured

43

by using a self-administered questionnaire included in the sensory evaluation part
wherein the respondents were asked to rate the affordability of brown rice based
on its current cost (R 60.00 to ® 80.00) (Form 3, see Appendix 3). Ratings were
from 1 to 10, with 1 being the highest. Ratings for cost were categorized as ‘Low
acceptability’ for those with ratings between 6 to 10, and ‘High acceptability’ for
those with ratings between 1-5, for utilization in the logistic regression analysis

(Table 2.11).

Monthly household income. Refers to the measure of the combined incomes of
all individuals sharing a place of residence. This includes all forms of income such
as salaries and wages, pensions, and profit from businesses. Monthly household
income was classified after data encoding into ‘0’ for monthly household income
lesser than or equal to PhP10,000 and ‘1’ for more than PhP 10,000, for use in the

analysis (Table 2.12)

Monthly food expenditure. Refers to the expenses or disbursements made by
the household purely for food consumption of the household members. Monthly
food expenditure was classified into ‘0’ for expenditures less than or equal to
PhP5,000 and ‘1’ for expenditures more than PhP5,000, for use in the analysis

Consumer perceptions. The positive or negative impression of an individual to a
specific food item based on previous experience, knowledge, tradition, and other
facts. Consumer perception was measured by using FGDs among two groups of
individuals — those who participated in the consumer acceptability test (SE Group)
and those who did not (NSE Group). Discussions were recorded verbatim and
were encoded and reported based on major classification of answers using the
FGD Guide Questions adapted from Phan et al., 2012 and Monge-Rojas et al.,
2014. Data obtained during the FGDs remained qualitative and was presented

separately from the quantitative data.

Major discussion points on the FGD on brown rice:
Typical meal. The type and combination of food items consumed by the
participants on a regular basis. Participants were asked what comes into mind

when the term ‘meal’ is mentioned.

Factors considered when buying food. This refers to the different parameters
taken into consideration by the buyer in the purchase of food for consumption

of the entire household.

Consumer perceptions for rice. The positive or negative impression of an
individual to rice and rice products. Participants were asked what comes to

mind when the term ‘rice’ is mentioned.

Typically consumed type of rice. This refers to the usual type and variety of rice

consumed by the household. Participants enumerated the most common

variety of rice consumed by the household and provided reasons for choosing

this type of rice.

Consumer perceptions for brown rice. The positive or negative impression of
an individual to brown rice as based on previous knowledge, tradition, and other
attributes of brown rice. Participants were asked of their opinion on brown rice
based from personal experiences and acquired knowledge as well as based

from their social interactions.

Factors affecting acceptability of brown rice. This refers to the different

parameters which plays a role in the acceptability of brown rice among the

participants and their household members.

Willingness to switch to brown rice. The level of willingness to change the usual
type of rice consumed by the household with brown rice. All FGD participants
were asked of their willingness to switch to brown rice if mentioned that there
were several studies which showed that brown rice is beneficial to the health.
On the other hand, the FGD SE group were also asked their level of willingness
to switch to brown rice given that they have already tried brown rice during the

consumer acceptability test.

Ways to convince others to eat brown rice. These are the different statements

which can be used to persuade other individuals to taste or consume brown
tice. Participants were asked what would be the most effective convincing

characteristics for other individuals to try brown rice.

People who can incorporate brown rice in daily meals. This refers to the groups

of people who can consume brown rice on a regular basis. Participants were
asked what groups or characteristics of people can and will regularly consume

brown rice.

Suggestions to improve brown rice. These are major recommendations from
participants on the ways to improve brown rice to increase its acceptability
among consumers. Participants were asked to enumerate the different
characteristics of brown rice which should be improved which can help increase

its acceptability among consumers.

CHAPTER Ill
METHODOLOGY
A. Study Design
The study employed a multi-method study design utilizing two separate
study phases for quantitative and qualitative data collection. Phase | was the
quantitative phase and included the face-to-face interviews (survey) and the
consumer acceptability of brown rice while Phase II was the qualitative phase and

included the FGD on the consumer perceptions for brown rice.

The data collection utilized a cross-sectional study design which
ascertained all variables (exposure and outcome) at a single point in time, during
Phase | of the study. The use of this type of study design allowed the collection of
data on the different exposures which can affect the consumer acceptability of
brown rice (outcome). Also, it maximized the resources and schedule, giving time
to conduct Phase I (and its subphases) and Phase II of the study at the same day
which prevented loss to follow up or attrition. Despite controlling this, the sample
size computed for the study allowed for 20 percent non-response. Even though the
study design has its advantages, causality still cannot be established. The study
can only conclude if the enumerated factors were associated with the outcome

(consumer acceptability of rice)

B. Study Phases

Phase |: Survey and Sensory Evaluation

Sub phase 1: Survey. |Information on the socio-demographic characteristics and
level of knowledge of the respondents were ascertained. Data on the socio-
demographic characteristics were obtained using a structured questionnaire (Form
1) by face-to-face interview with the respondents while the knowledge assessment

(Form 2) was self-administered.

Sub phase 2: Consumer Acceptability of Brown Rice. After the survey, consumer
acceptability of the sensory attributes and overall acceptability of brown rice was
ascertained through sensory evaluation among a subsample of the respondents.
The acceptability was measured using a self-administered questionnaire which
utilized a 9-point Hedonic scale with “1” as ‘Dislike extremely’ and “9" as ‘Like

extremely’

Phase Il: Focus group discussions

For the respondents who completed Phase |, FGD groups were formed from
those who have underwent the consumer acceptability test (SE group) and those
who did not (NSE Group) (see Data Collection Procedure). For each barangay,
one SE and one NSE group were formed for the FGDs. Overall, a total of 16 FGD
groups were formed in which FGDs were conducted which was aimed to delve
more deeply on the consumer perceptions for brown rice of the households.
Answers were recorded verbatim and were classified based on the major

classifications found on the FGD Guide Questions (Appendix 7) such as typical

50

meal, factors considered when buying food, consumer perceptions for rice,
typically consumed type of rice, consumer perceptions for brown rice, factors
affecting acceptability of brown rice, willingness to switch to brown rice, ways to
convince others to eat brown rice, people who can incorporate brown rice in daily

meals and suggestions to improve brown rice.

of Manila. North Caloocan is bounded on

the north-northwest by the province of Bulacan; on the south-southeast by Quezon

City; and southwest by Valenzuela

Caloocan is an urban first-class city based on income. Majority of the land
area is used for residential purposes with some used for commercial purposes.

There is a total of 188 barangays with a population of 1.48 million people in 2010

51

This population accounted for 12.56 percent of the population in the NCR with a
growth rate of 2.37 percent growth rate. Caloocan city is the third largest city in the

Philippines.

In 2013, local health data on the ten causes of mortality among residents of
Caloocan City included NCDs and complications of NCDs such as cardiovascular
diseases (CVDs) and other heart diseases, myocardial infarction, multi-organ
failure, hypertension and renal disease (pooled rate: 160/100,000 population)
(CHO, 2014). Data on the leading causes of morbidity is not available among adult
residents of Caloocan City. Majority of nutrition programs in Caloocan are focused
‘on children and mothers, with minimal attention provided for improving nutrition
among adults. In 2013, only 0.79 percent of the city’s budget has been allocated
for mobilizing adults in Caloocan with projects under the Healthy Lifestyle Program
which includes “Hataw Exercise” (exercise campaign) and provision of free fasting

blood sugar (FBS) tests

D. Sampling Technique
Sample Size Determination

This was computed using the OpenEpi website (http:/www.openepi.com).
The sample size was computed assuming 80 percent power, 95 percent level of
confidence, and has been adjusted for 20 percent non-response (buffer). Sample

size was computed for specific objective numbers 1 and 4.

Objective 1. To determine the level of acceptability of cooked brown rice among
household heads

Based from a previous study by Heinemann et al. (2006), which indicated
that a total of 33.2 percent of the population who tasted brown rice ranked it as
desirable (like very much and like moderately). The computed sample size for
objective 1 was 341. Adjusting for 20 percent non-response rate, the minimum

ssample size for this objective was 410 respondents.

Objective 4. To determine if the sensory attributes of brown rice are associated
with its the acceptability among household heads

Based from a sensory evaluation study by Muhihi et al. (2013) which
indicated that 34 percent of the population's post-tasting acceptability was
influenced by the sensory attributes of rice. Also, the result of a previous study by
Zhang et al. (2010) indicated that a total of 72 percent of the population's pre-
tasting acceptability was influenced by the sensory attributes of rice would result
to a very low sample size, a value of 50 percent for those unexposed with outcome
was assumed for the purpose of this study. The computed sample size for
objective 4: Sensory attributes was 308. Adjusting for 20 percent non-response

rate, the minimum sample size for this objective was 370 respondents

Objective 4. To determine if the cost_of brown rice is associated with its
acceptability among household heads

Based from a previous study by Muhihi et al. (2013) which indicated that a
total of 38 percent of the population's post-tasting acceptability was influenced by

the cost of rice. Also, since there were no previous studies associating cost and

53

acceptability among individuals who have not tasted brown rice, a value of 50
percent for those unexposed with outcome was assumed for the purpose of this
study. The computed sample size for objective 4: cost was 528. Adjusting for 20
percent non-response rate, the minimum sample size for this objective was 634

respondents.

Objective 4. To determine if the ease of preparation of brown rice is associated
with its acceptability among household heads

Based from a previous study by Muhihi et al. (2013) which indicated that a
total of 21 percent of the population's post-tasting acceptability was influenced by
the ease of preparation of rice. Also, since there were no previous studies
associating ease of preparation and acceptability among individuals who have not
tasted brown rice, a value of 35 percent for those unexposed with outcome was
assumed for the purpose of this study. The computed sample size for objective 4:
ease of preparation was 318. Adjusting for 20 percent non-response rate, the

minimum sample size for this objective was 382 respondents.

Objective 4. To determine if the knowledge on the nutritional properties of brown
tice is associated with its acceptability among household heads

Based from a previous study by Heinemann et al. (2006) which indicated
that a total of 71.7 percent of the population's acceptability were influenced by the
knowledge on the nutritional properties of brown rice. Also, since there were no
previous studies associating knowledge on the nutritional property of brown rice
and acceptability among individuals who have not tasted brown rice, a value of 50

percent for those unexposed with outcome was assumed for the purpose of this

54

study. The computed sample size for objective 4: knowledge on the nutritional
properties of brown rice was 160. Adjusting for 20 percent non-response rate, the
minimum sample size for this objective was 192 respondents.

Objective 4. To determine if customs/traditions is associated with its acceptability
among household heads

Based from a previous study by Muhihi et al. (2013) which indicated that a
total of 41 percent of the population's post-tasting acceptability were influenced by
their customs/traditions. Furthermore, based from a previous study by Zhang et al.
(2010) which indicated that a total of 22 percent of the population's pre-tasting
acceptability were influenced by their customs/traditions. The computed sample
size for objective 4: customs/traditions was 190. Adjusting for 20 percent non-
response rate, the minimum sample size for this objective was 228 respondents

Objective 4. To determine if health consciousness is associated with its
acceptability among household heads

Based from a previous study by Muhihi et al. (2013) which indicated that a
total of 36 percent of the population's post-tasting acceptability were influenced by
their health consciousness. Also, since there were no previous studies associating
health consciousness and acceptability of brown rice among individuals who have
not tasted brown rice, a value of 50 percent for those unexposed with outcome
was assumed for the purpose of this study. The computed sample size for
objective 4: customs/traditions was 388. Adjusting for 20 percent non-response

rate, the minimum sample size for this objective was 466 respondents.

Based from the sample size calculation from the two objectives, the highest
computed sample size was for objective number 4 (cost) which was 634
respondents. Although a target of 634 respondents was computed for
ascertaining the outcome and the exposure variables, logistical and financial
barriers hindered conducting the consumer acceptability test (which was the
source of data for the outcome) among the targeted sample size. Therefore,
exposure variables were obtained, achieving the target sample size of 634, but the
outcome variable (overall acceptability of brown rice) was only obtained in the

subsample of 104 sensory panelists.

Sampling Design (Figure 3.2)

The quantitative part of the study utilized multi-level stratified simple random
sampling. Caloocan City was stratified to its geographical location (North and
South Caloocan). The list of barangays per stratum was obtained from the
sociodemographic data of Caloocan City (Caloocan City, 2014). In South
Caloocan, barangays included in the random sampling were Barangays 1 to 164
while for North Caloocan, Barangays 165 to 188 (except Barangay 177, since it
was utilized for the pre- and pilot testing) were included. Simple random sampling
via Fishbowl method was used to determine the participating barangays for North

and South Caloocan. A total of four barangays per stratified location was obtained

In each participating barangay, the list of registered voters was obtained
from the barangay records and simple random sampling was used to ascertain 380
households from the barangays in North Caloocan (95 households per each
barangay) and 256 households from the barangays in South Caloocan (64
households per each barangay). With the assistance from the barangay officials.
chosen households were visited individually and household members were asked
to determine their household head based on the definition below. If multiple
individuals were chosen in a single household via random sampling, only the
chosen household head was included in the study. Substitution for duplications
were not done since the sample size computation already accounted for 20 percent

non-response.

Household (Sampling population): Refers to an aggregate of persons, generally
but not necessarily bound by ties of kinship, who live together under the same roof
and eat together or share in common the household food (PSA, 2003). A person

who lives alone is also considered a separate household.

Household heads (Elementary unit): Refers to the person who manages the
food preparations including, but not limited to, purchasing and preparing the food.
The household head is the one who has authority over the decisions of the
household members when it comes to food consumption and whose opinion on
food consumption has the greatest impact in the decision of the household

members.

The study was explained to each household head verbally and through the
Informed Consent Form (ICF) (Appendix 2) by the data collectors and were asked
for their informed consent without the presence of the barangay officials to prevent

coercion or unwilling participation in the study.

For the consumer acceptability test, a subsample of eligible respondents
from Phase | was ascertained by simple random sampling. In sensory evaluation
or consumer acceptability tests, a minimum sample size of 100 subjects is enough
to determine a difference of about 0.4 standard deviations with minimal chance of
missing true differences as compared to using smaller sample sizes (20 to 50)
(Lawless and Heymann, 2010). Therefore, for the consumer acceptability
conducted in this study, a subsample of 100 subjects was targeted. The number
of respondents sampled for the consumer acceptability test per stratified location

58

was proportional to the total number of households in North and South Caloocan.
A total of 59 North Caloocan household heads (a total of 15 panelists per
barangay) and 41 South Caloocan household heads (a total of 11 panelists per
barangay) were selected for the consumer acceptability test. The procedures for
subphase II or the consumer acceptability phase was again verbally explained to
the sampled population prior to the actual conduct of Phase II. Participants were
allowed to back out at this phase of the study, but substitution was made to achieve

the target 100 participants for the consumer acceptability test.

After Phase |, the respondents were asked if they were willing to participate
in the FGD. Due to the time consumed for the FGD, each FGD group consist of
only six to 13 members. Also, the initial proposal to homogenize (based on
nutritional status, age, and sex) the FGD groups was not accomplished due to
logistical barriers. Since the target sample size was high, computation of the BMI
was not accomplished at the end of Phase |, also, barangays chosen for
participation were geographically distant from each other, making it difficult to
transport respondents with similar characteristics from one barangay to another.
Hence, only willingness to participate in the FGDs became the sole inclusion
criteria for the FGD groups. For each barangay, two groups were formed (SE and
NSE group). Respondents for Phase | were not coerced to join the FGD and
provision of meals after the FGD was not mentioned to the respondents to prevent

influencing their decision to participate.

A total of 584 respondents (92.1% response rate) participated in the survey
and knowledge assessment, 104 panelists for the consumer acceptability test, and
146 participants for the FGDs (76 participants for the NSE Group and 70

participants for the SE Group).

Although a target of 634 respondents was computed for ascertaining the
outcome and the exposure variables, logistical and financial barriers hindered
conducting the consumer acceptability test (which was the source of data for the
outcome) among the targeted sample size. Therefore, exposure variables were
obtained, achieving the target sample size of 634, but the outcome variable (overall
acceptability of brown rice) was only obtained in the subsample of 104 sensory

E. Data Collection Procedure

3.1. Preparation
3.1.1. Validity testing of data collection instruments

Construct, content, and face validity of the questionnaires were

tested by consulting individuals who specialize in brown rice research and
development. This included four researchers from the Department of
Science and Technology (DOST) who were asked to review the
questionnaires and provide inputs as to its relevance, applicability, and
comprehensiveness in the local context. Major comments from the validity
testing included using the Filipino translation of Form 2 and ICF, changing
the choices of answer for the willingness and health consciousness

61

question in Form 1 (from ‘Yes/No’ to range of 1-5), conctruct and content
changes in Form 1, Form 2, and Form 3. Validity testing was conducted
prior to pretesting and data collection and comments and suggestions from

the consultation were incorporated prior to the start of the study.

3.1.2, Manpower and data collection instruments

All data collection procedures were done by the study proponent and
data collectors in coordination with the barangay officials. Four additional
manpower were hired for the purpose of the study especially for the survey
and consumer acceptability phase. The study proponent was previously
trained in face-to-face interview to obtain sociodemographic and economic
data and anthropometric measurements (height and weight). The study
proponent trained the data collectors on proper face-to-face interview
procedures to prevent leading questions and incomplete or inappropriate
answers. Data collectors were also trained in anthropometric
measurements using a bathroom scale and tape measure. For the specific

terms of reference of the data collectors, see Appendix 4

For the sensory evalutation, procedures were followed according to
Lawless and Heymann (2010). The study proponent trained the data
collectors on proper set-up of the consumer acceptability test area,
preparation of the rice samples, randomization of the individual samples,
and other important protocols for the consumer acceptability test. A mock

consumer acceptability test was conducted to test the knowledge of the data

62

collectors on the processes involved in the consumer acceptability test and

to adjust the processes accordingly.

Lastly, for the FGD, the study proponent trained the Field
Coordinator on actual FGD procedures as guided by the FGD Guide
Questions (Appendix 7). Since the study proponent was not present during
majority of the data collection schedule, the FGD was conducted by the
Field Coordinator in all sample barangays except the first barangay (in
which the study proponent conducted the FGD). One of the hired data
collector have previous experience in the conduct of FGDs in qualitative

research which aided in standardizing the processes for the FGDs.

Several data collection instruments were used in the study. This
included the ICF, Form 1: Subject Profile, Form 2: Knowledge Assessment.
and Form 3: Sensory Evaluation. The ICF was read and the processes of
the study was explained to the sampled household heads prior to the
conduct of the face-to-face interview. Household heads were given ample
time to decide in the participation in the study, and questions were still
entertained even if the survey, knowledge assessment, consumer
acceptability test, and FGDs were already ongoing. Household heads who
agreed to participate in the study were asked to sign the ICF wherein a
duplicate copy was retained for their reference. The subject profile of the
household heads (Form 1, see Appendix 3) was collected through face-to-

face interview. Knowledge assessment form (Form 2, see Appendix 3) was

63

self-administered for most of the respondents, however, some respondents
requested the questionnaire to be administered through face-to-face
interview due to their difficulty in reading the questionnaires or due to being
more comfortable in a face-to-face interview rather than the test being self-
administered. The consumer acceptability form (Form 3, see Appendix 3)
was self-administered during the consumer acceptability test in the
barangay hall/consumer acceptability test venue. This form included the
question on the acceptability of cost and ease of preparation of brown rice.
Forms 1 to 3 originally used the English language as a medium but Form 2
and the ICF were translated to Filipino. Although the translated versions
were used as based on the comments during the validity testing, the English

version of Form 2 and the ICF were still retained for reference.

The FGD was conducted using a topic guide adapted from Phan et
al. (2012) and Monge-Rojas et al. (2014) (see Appendix 7). Participants of
the FGD were asked questions on the major concepts for consumer
perceptions on brown rice such as typical meal, factors considered when
buying food, consumer perceptions for rice, typically consumed type of rice,
consumer perceptions for brown rice, factors affecting acceptability of
brown rice, willingness to switch to brown rice, ways to convince others to
eat brown rice, people who can incorporate brown rice in daily meals and
suggestions to improve brown rice. All questionnaires were pre-tested and
pilot tested prior to the conduct of the actual data collection, for the

standardization of procedures

ig

3.1.3. Pretesting

Questionnaires were pretested in a barangay in Caloocan which was
not chosen for participation in the study (Barangay 177). Pretesting involved
answering the questionnaires as well as conducting an open forum to obtain
the comments of the participants regarding the adequacy and relevance of
the questionnaires in the local context. Generally, minimal revisions were
commented in the questionnaire (revisions include enlarging the size of
text), but no major revisions were incorporated in the questionnaire prior to
the pilot testing and actual data collection. Revised questionnaires were
then pilot tested in another set of respondents in the same barangay. Pilot
testing involved undergoing all the phases to check the feasibility of the
processes indicated from the study proposal. Processes were standardized
with the data collectors during the pilot testing for implementation in all

sampled barangays for the actual data collection.

3.1.4. Coordination

The study was coordinated with the City Nutrition Action Office for
permission for ethical clearance. After the approval of the proposal from the
panel and the ethical review board, the study was coordinated directly to
the barangays chosen for participation, as recommended at the city level
The coordination oriented the barangay officials on the data collection
procedures, the target participants and the significance of the study for

Caloocan City. The benefits of the study for the residents in Caloocan City

65

were also emphasized. Households were then chosen for participation in
the study through random sampling of the list of registered voters in the
barangays. Households were asked who they see as household heads and
the determined household heads were oriented verbally and through the
ICF prior to agreement of participating in the study. Household heads were
provided transportation to and from the data collection site (especially for
the consumer acceptability test and FGDs) to prevent incurring additional

expenses on the part of the respondent.

3.2. Phase 1: Survey and Consumer Acceptability Test
3.2.1. Sub phase 1: Survey

After the agreement between the household head and the study
proponent, a face-to-face interview, which took at most 20 minutes, on basic
subject information was done among all sampled household heads using
Form 1: Subject Profile. The respondents were given ample time to answer
each question. Height and weight of the respondents were also ascertained
using a tape measure and a bathroom scale. Specific processes on
determining the height and weight is explained by Gibson (2005). After the
face-to-face interview, the respondents were asked to self-administer the
knowledge assessment form and were given ample amount of time to do
so. However, several respondents requested to conduct the knowledge
assessment through face-to-face interview due to their difficulty in reading
the questionnaires or due to being more comfortable in face-to-face
interview rather than the test being self-administered. Form 2 was translated

68

to Filipino and was used for all respondents (as commented during the
validity testing, in which the translated version was more appropriate to be
used during the study). After answering, the forms were checked for

completeness before moving on to another respondent.

3.2.2. Sub phase 2: Sensory Evaluation

Sensory evaluation or the consumer acceptability test was done as
previously described by Lawless and Heymann (2010). The consumer
acceptability test was aimed to accomplish one to two barangays per day
at strictly set schedules between 9 to 11 in the morning and 2 to 4 in the
afternoon. Each panelist was able to finish the evaluation in a maximum of
30 minutes from start of evaluation. Detailed procedures are explained

below.

3.2.2.1. Panelist

A subsample (n = 104) of the household heads served as the
panelists for the study. For the purpose of the study, the panelists
were not trained or pre-oriented on the nutritional properties of brown
rice and other facts about brown rice. A total of 104 participants were
chosen by random sampling per each stratified location (see
Sampling Technique). Pregnant/actating individuals, persons with
allergy to brown rice, and individuals with altered taste due to
medication or special diet were excluded from the consumer

acceptability test.

3.2.2.2. Sample

A total of four samples were used in the study: Sample A -
Brown Rice (supermarket), Sample B - Brown Rice (supermarket),
Sample C - Brown Rice (local wet market) and Control Sample D -
(Sinandomeng variety). All the rice samples used in the study are
available in major supermarkets and wet markets in Caloocan. Brand
names of the samples used were not disclosed to prevent

association of the study to major brand players in the rice industry

Rice samples were cooked in four separate rice cookers in the
barangay hall/consumer acceptability room prior to the start of the
consumer acceptability test. Brown rice samples were cooked in a
tice cooker with a 1:2 rice and water ratio, while the control was
cooked with a 1:1 rice and water ratio. A total of 200g raw rice was
cooked per batch per sample to produce 400g cooked rice. Cooked
samples were placed in individual plastic cups (with approximately
20g each), labeled using a random three-digit number, and was used
for consumer acceptability test immediately with a maximum holding
period of 60 minutes from cooking time. Serving temperature was
maintained at more than or equal to 50°C. Placement of the samples

on the tray was randomized per panelist.

3.2.2.3. Test setup

Panelists were accompanied by the data collectors from place
of residence to the consumer acceptability test area. A waiting area
was provided in a location near the barangay hall/ consumer
acceptability test area. The panelists were asked to wait in this area
prior to their turn simultaneous with a verbal orientation on the
consumer acceptability test procedure, proper filling up of forms,
proper decorum during consumer acceptability test, and other

important details.

All the samples, four spoons, the consumer acceptability test
forms (one for each sample, and the form for the acceptability of the
cost and ease of preparation. A total of seven forms including the
instruction page), water and pencil were placed in a tray and were
given to the panelists. Water was provided and the panelists were
asked to rinse their mouth before and after testing of each sample.
The panelists were asked to rate the rice samples based on color
and appearance, odor, taste, texture, and overall acceptability using
a 9-point Hedonic scale with “1" representing ‘Dislike extremely’ and
“9” representing ‘Like extremely’. Trays were removed from the booth
right after the evaluation of the panelist, before a new panelist was

asked to enter the evaluation area.

3.2.2.4. Test area

A temporary consumer acceptability test area was created in
the barangay hall/consumer acceptability test area for the use in the
study. The consumer acceptability test venue was chosen and
inspected prior to actual data collection to check the appropriateness
facilities. In majority of the barangays, the consumer acceptability
test was conducted in the barangay hall. However, if the barangay
hall was not available, not appropriate, or did not contain the
necessary requirements for a consumer acceptability test area, a

function room near the barangay hall was rented.

Four booths for evaluation with a size of 1 m by 1 m by size
were created. Panelists were not allowed to wander in the consumer
acceptability test area before, during or after the consumer
acceptability test. It was ensured in the setup that the panelists were
not able to see each other. The data collectors observed the
consumer acceptability test to prevent the panelists from
communicating and for assuring that the procedures were carried out
well. It was ensured that the evaluation area was well-lighted
(fluorescent lighting equivalent to daylight), well-ventilated, and with

no extraneous odors present.

The preparation area was located on an adjacent room in the

barangay hall/consumer acceptability test area. This housed four

70

different rice cookers for the samples and the utensils and other

paraphernalia used by the panelists.

3.2.2.5. Test run or pilot testing

To test the flow of the procedures for Phase |, a test run or
pilot testing was done among ten individuals (equivalent to one batch
of panelists) of Barangay 177, a barangay with similar characteristics
to the sampled barangays but was not included in the sampling. All
the procedures from the face-to-face interviews to the consumer
acceptability test were conducted to simulate actual data collection
procedure. After the test run, the participants were gathered to gain
comments on the processes involved and suggestions for

improvement.

3.3. Phase Il: Focus Group Discussion

The FGDs were done after the consumer acceptability test (for the SE
Group) and after the survey and knowledge assessment (for the NSE Group). As
mentioned before, the initial proposal to homogenize (based on nutritional status,
age, and sex) the FGD groups was not accomplished due to logistical barriers.
Since the target sample size was high, computation of the BMI was not
accomplished at the end of Phase |, barangays chosen for participation were
geographically distant from each other, making it difficult to transport respondents.
with similar characteristics from one barangay to another. Hence, only willingness
to participate in the FGDs became the sole inclusion criteria for the FGD groups.
For each barangay, two groups were formed (SE and NSE group). Respondents
for Phase | were not coerced to join the FGD and provision of meals after the FGD
was not mentioned to the respondents to prevent influencing their decision to

participate.

A total of 16 groups with six to 13 members per group (Table 3.2) were
asked to participate in the study (eight groups for SE and eight groups for NSE).
Topics discussed include typical meal, factors considered when buying food,
consumer perceptions for rice, typically consumed type of rice, consumer
perceptions for brown rice, factors affecting acceptability of brown rice, willingness
to switch to brown rice, ways to convince others to eat brown rice, people who can
incorporate brown rice in daily meals and suggestions to improve brown rice. FGDs
were recorded verbatim. The FGDs lasted for about 30 to 45 minutes, depending

on the level of participation of the FGD participants. Results of the FGDs were
7)

presented based on the most usual and noteworthy statements of the participants,

which may support the results of the quantitative phase.

F. Data Processing and Analysis

Data cleaning and editing were done right after each data collection day.
Each form was checked for completeness and afterwards, data were encoded
using Microsoft Office Excel 2013. As a guide to the coding and encoding process,
a coding manual was developed by the study proponent (see Appendix 5). This
helped in the standardization of answers for coding and as well as for the
categorization of variables. Data encoding was done by the study proponent while
data validation was done twice (first by the Field Coordinator then by the Study
Proponent) to ensure the correctness of the data. Raw data were categorized as

guided by the Operational Definition of the variables and the Coding Manual (see

Operational Definition of Terms and Coding Manual). Data were analyzed using

Stata Software version 12 and were presented in appropriate graphs and tables.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the socioeconomic and
demographic profiles of the household heads. For the qualitative variables
(nominal and ordinal) in Form 1 (Subject Profile), frequencies and proportions were
computed while for the quantitative variables in the ratio scale, the mean and

standard deviation were computed.

In the consumer acceptability test of different attributes of brown rice, mean
Hedonic ratings were presented per attribute for each sample. Differences of the
mean ratings of the brown rice samples from the control for the different sensory

attributes were ascertained using Dunnett's test using a=0.05.

Multiple binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the
factors associated with overall acceptability of rice. Overall acceptability (outcome)
was categorized after data processing which came up with binary values which
was then used for logistic regression. Stepwise logistic regression was run for each
covariate until the final logit model was obtained. Level of significance was set at

a = 0.05 for ail the statistical tests.

G. Scope and Delimitations of the Study

The study employed a multi-method study design utilizing two separate
study phases for quantitative and qualitative data collection. The study was
conducted in a single urban area which is Caloocan City. Participants for the study
were delimited to household heads of selected barangays in Caloocan City, which
were only those who are listed as current registered voters in the barangays. Also,
the study utilized questionnaires developed by the study proponent and for the
consumer acceptability, the 9-point Hedonic scale was used to ascertain
acceptability, since it was the most common and recommended scale for
consumer acceptability tests. Exposure variables used in the study are delimited
to the attributes of brown rice (sensory attributes, cost, ease of preparation);
individual characteristics (knowledge on the nutritional properties of brown rice,
customs/tradition, health consciousness); and household characteristics

(household income, household size, daily food expenditure).

H. Ethical Considerations
This research has been reviewed and approved by the UP Manila Research
Ethics Board (UPMREB) - Ethics Review Panel via expedited review on 20

January 2017 with study protocol code: UPMREB 2016-403-01 (Appendix 1).

The study was explained both through verbal and written form (ICF).
including possible risks of allergic reactions to brown rice consumption such as
diarrhea, flatulence or a bloated feeling, abdominal pain, and nausea. While the

possibility of allergies is uncommon especially in adults, the participants were still

16

made aware of the possibility. It was also explained that the data collected will help
to understand and improve the factors associated with acceptability of brown rice
among households and that there may not be any benefit to participants or the
society at this stage of the research, but future generations are likely to benefit
from the results of this study. Also, participants in the consumer acceptability test
phase would have the chance to taste brown rice and appreciate its sensory
characteristics thus widening the horizon of the participants to include brown rice

in their daily diets and consequently better their health by doing so.

The participants were given ample time to decide after the orientation. The
‘study proponent was the one who asked the prospective participants if they were
willing to take part in the study, without the presence of any barangay official
Inquiries regarding the study were entertained during the orientation and before
signing the informed consent form. After agreement to the study, the ICF was
obtained from the participants and counterchecked for completeness. Inquiries
were still entertained even after the signing of the consent form within the duration
of the study. The collected ICFs were filed and are kept securely in a locked cabinet
for counterchecking in the future. A duplicate copy of the ICF was also provided to

the household head for their reference.

The participants will not be identified individually in any publication
Confidential participant information including the pre-assessments done will be
made available to the participants and the project team upon request. Anonymity

was ensured by providing an alphanumeric code for the households. If it is

vad

necessary to identify the participant because of safety and regulatory reasons,
agreement between the participant, proponent, and other individuals concerned
shall be needed on maintaining the confidentiality of the participant to any outside

parties.

A participant may dropout from the study due to any personal and health
reasons without any consequences and/or fees. Appropriate documentation of the
reasons for not participating or completing the study was maintained by the project
team. Participants were provided transportation to and from the data collection site,
thus, no compensatory allowance was provided for the entire duration of the study.
However, incentives, in the form of food packs or meals, were still provided for

those who completed participated in the consumer acceptability test and FGDs.

This study was funded by government and academic institutions such
Department of Science and Technology-Science Education Institute (DOST-SE!)
and the UP Manila National Graduate Office for the Health Sciences (UPM-
NGOHS). The principal investigator did not seek any funding and do not have any
personal relationship with private institutions, people, and organizations that could

inappropriately influence or bias the content of the paper.

CHAPTER IV

RESULTS

A. Phase |: Results of the Survey and consumer acceptability test

For Phase | of the study, a total of 584 respondents participated in the survey
(subject profile and knowledge assessment) wherein 346 are from North Caloocan
and 238 are from South Caloocan. For the consumer acceptability test, a total of 104
out of the 584 participated wherein 60 are from North Caloocan and 44 are from South

Caloocan.

Demographic Characteristics of Household Heads

The result of the survey is summarized in Table 4.1. Out of the 584
respondents, a total of 67.1 percent were females with mean age of 42.3 years old.
More than half (59.6%) of the respondents had normal body mass index (BMI) based
from the WHO Classification but significant percentage of the sample were
overnourished (24.7% were overweight and 8.6% were obese). More than half of the
respondents were married (67.8%) with nuclear family types (71.8%). Mean
household size mirrored the city data at an average of five members per household
Household heads were mostly high school graduates (39.0%) while some were

college undergraduates (19.0%).

Socioeconomic Characteristics of Sample Households and Household Heads
For the socioeconomic characteristics of the households (Table 4.2), only an
average of two household members were earning for the household. Mean estimated
monthly household income was at PhP21,293.5, of this income, an average of
PhP8,266.2 was allocated for food expenditure of the household members. Average

rice expenditure was at PhP72.5 per day.

Customs and Traditions

For the customs and traditions (Table 4.3), more than half of the respondents
(60.6%) had already tasted brown rice in the past. Similarly, 345 respondents (59.1%)
were willing to substitute white rice with brown rice while only 42 respondents (7.2%)
had negative experiences in eating brown rice. Negative experiences in brown rice
consumption was identified as a factor affecting acceptability of brown rice in the study
by Phan et al. in 2012 wherein Vietnamese respondents associate brown rice with a
period of poverty in Vietnam, with brown rice being one of the primary food item during
the period of poverty. Among the respondents, negative experiences in the

consumption of brown rice primarily involved having allergies or diarrhea when brown

81

rice was consumed in the past. Summarizing the answers under customs/tradition
(tasted brown rice in the past, willingness to switch to brown rice, and negative
experiences on brown rice), a total of 447 (76.54%) had supportive customs/tradition

which can improve the acceptability of brown rice.

Health Consciousness

Respondents were asked of their level of perceived health consciousness.
Majority (56.9%) of the respondents were self-perceived health conscious (answered
‘Very Health Conscious’ and ‘Health Conscious’ in the question “How do you perceive
yourself in terms of health consciousness?”) while the rest (43.2%) answered
‘Neither’, ‘Not Health Conscious’ and ‘Very Health Unconscious’ to the health

consciousness question.

Consumer Acceptability of Brown Rice

The study utilized three different samples of brown rice and one control (white
tice) for the consumer acceptability test. Comparison of the samples revealed that
sample A has the lowest ratings for the different attributes of brown rice while the
control (sample D) has the highest mean Hedonic rating. Among the brown rice
samples, sample C was the most acceptable, followed by sample B, and lastly, sample

A. The summary of the results of the consumer acceptability test are presented in

Knowledge Characteristics of Household Heads

The knowledge assessment consisted of a 15-point self-administered
questionnaire administered to the respondents after the face-to-face interview (Form
1). Questions were based on the nutritional facts and attributes of brown rice based
from pertinent literature as discussed in the previous chapters (see Theoretical
Background). Mean score was 53.7 percent with minimum and maximum scores of

zero and 93.3 percent, respectively (Table 4.5).

When looked into the specific questions asked (Table 4.6), highest frequency
of correct answers were in the following questions: (1) Brown rice has higher
nutritional content (vitamins and minerals) compared to white rice (82.7%); (2) Brown
rice is generally regarded as a low-glycemic food, with beneficial effects on blood
sugar control (79.1%); (3) Regular brown rice consumption helps prevent vitamin B
deficiencies such as beriberi (73.6%); and (4) Consumption of brown rice does not

affect an individual's cholesterol levels positively (70.2%).

On the other hand, questions with lowest frequencies of correct answers

included the following questions: (1) Brown rice is a good source of protein (9.6%); (2)

84

White rice and brown rice grains comes from different rice plant sources (21.8%); and
(3) A cup of cooked brown rice have a different caloric content compared to white rice

Factors Affecting Acceptability of Brown Rice

Prevalence of the outcome (low and high acceptability of brown rice) as cross-
tabulated with the covariates are summarized in Table 4.7. High acceptability of the
sensory attributes and cost of brown rice yielded high acceptability of the outcome.
Specifically, high acceptability of the sensory attributes of brown rice such as color
and appearance, odor, taste, and texture resulted to higher frequency of respondents
rating the outcome (overall acceptability of brown rice) as acceptable at 87.0 percent,
94.9 percent, 93.0 percent, and 94.7 percent, respectively. Finally, high acceptability
of the cost yielded high number of the respondents rating brown rice as acceptable at

73.5 percent

Despite the significance of some factors when crude logistic regression was
used, the result of the multiple binary logistic regression (Table 4.9) found that the
factors associated with the overall acceptability of brown rice were the following: color
and appearance, taste, and price. Controlling for the other effects of the other
variables, the odds of acceptability of brown rice were 11 times higher if the consumer
liked the color and appearance of rice (AOR = 10.8, 95%CI: 2.50; 46.27), 20 times
higher if the consumer liked the taste of rice (AOR = 19.80; 95%CI: 2.99; 131.15), and
10 times higher when price was acceptable to the consumer (OR = 21.29; 95%CI:

B. Phase I: Consumer Perceptions for Brown Rice: Results of the Focus-Group

The FGDs were done after the consumer acceptability test (for the SE Group)
and after the survey and knowledge assessment (for the NSE Group). As mentioned
before, the initial proposal to homogenize (based on nutritional status, age, and sex)
the FGD groups was not accomplished due to logistical barriers. Since the target
sample size was high, computation of the BMI was not accomplished at the end of
Phase |, barangays chosen for participation were geographically distant from each
other, making it difficult to transport respondents with similar characteristics from one
barangay to another. Hence, only willingness to participate in the FGDs became the
sole inclusion criteria for the FGD groups. For each barangay, two groups were formed
(SE and NSE group). Respondents for Phase | were not coerced to join the FGD and
provision of meals after the FGD was not mentioned to the respondents to prevent

influencing their decision to participate

A total of 146 respondents participated in the FGDs forming 16 groups. These
groups comprised two FGD groups per barangay (SE and NSE). The characteristics
of the FGD participants are shown in Table 4.10. Further, the verbatim transcript of

the FGDs is found in Appendix 9.

For the NSE group, majority were females (64.47%) with a mean age of 43.75
years. A total of 51 (67.11%) had normal nutritional status while 25 (32.88%) were

overweight. Overall, a total of eight NSE groups were formed for the FGDs (one per

barangay) with a total number of 76 participants, each group ranging in size from six

to 12 people.

On the other hand, for the SE group, majority were also females (65.7%) with
a mean age of 42.0 years. A total of 50 (71.4%) had normal nutritional status while 20
(28.6%) were overweight. Overall, a total of eight SE groups were also formed for the
FGDs (one per barangay) with a total number of 70 participants, each group ranging

in size from six to 13 people.

The results of the FGDs are presented in the subsequent paragraphs based on
significant statements on the major discussion points based from the FGD guide
questions adapted from Phan et al., 2012 and Monge-Rojas et al., 2014 (Appendix 7)
— typical meal, factors considered when buying food, consumer perceptions for rice,
typically consumed type of rice, consumer perceptions for brown rice, factors affecting
acceptability of brown rice, willingness to switch to brown rice, ways to convince others.
to eat brown rice, people who can incorporate brown rice in daily meals and
suggestions to improve brown rice. Qualitative statements were chosen by the study
proponent based on recurring answers of the participants. A list of selected qualitative

statements are found in Appendix 8.

Typical Meal

Generally, the typical meal consumed by majority of the participants are rice-
based complemented with home-cooked dishes ("lutong bahay”) such as “sinigang”
(sour pork stew), “adobo” (pork with soy sauce and vinegar), “nilaga” (pork/beef stew),
and “kare-kare” (peanut-based stew). Several participants mentioned preference for
meat — fish, chicken, pork — while some also mentioned preference for vegetables.
The term meal is usually associated with lunch and dinner but is also sometimes
associated with other food items such as bread, junk foods, juice/soft drinks, fruits,
and milk. A specific participant answered that when meal is mentioned, | think of a
complete meal, which includes fruits, chicken, vegetables with rice. Other participants
also mentioned fondness for pasta and other fast food items such as fries, burger, and
chicken with rice. Specifically, a participant mentioned we always prefer flavorful

dishes and not settle with average taste or quality. Several participants with children

92

or those who live with children particularly mentioned frequent consumption of fried
foods (usually processed foods such as hotdog and longganisa) because of the food
preferences of the children, specifically stating that we usually eat processed foods

such as hotdog and longganisa, due to the food preference of the children.

Factors Considered When Buying Food

Participants were asked of the factors considered when choosing or buying
food. Majority of the participants answered price as one of the priority considerations
when buying food due to increasing prices in the market at the current time.
Specifically, one participant responded that they prioritize price to make ends meet.
Also, most participants mentioned that they budget their incomes wisely but we do not
compromise the quality of food they [children] eat. Through proper budgeting and
choices, we can obtain cheap food which is also tasty. Several mentioned that price
dictates the food they will eat and that chosen food should be cheap or can be
accommodated in their budget since they are still allocating budget for other expenses
‘such as utilities, gas, education of children, and others. Next to price, nutrient content
of foods was also a consideration especially among those with NCDs such as diabetes
and hypertension. Participants with NCDs and those who live with family members
with NCDs tend to choose healthy foods and take into consideration the foods not
allowed to the patient. A participant mentioned that they consider healthy foods,
however, we also take into consideration our budget. Ultimately, nutritional value is
not considered alone but always partnered with other characteristics such as price
and taste. Also, majority of the participants considered taste as one of the primary
factors considered when buying food since they want to obtain satisfaction with their

93

meal. However, taste is not the sole factor considered as the participants always ties
taste with price or affordability, mentioning that foods they buy should be both tasty
and cheap. Other factors considered by the participants when choosing or buying food

are appearance, texture, freshness or quality, and ease of preparation.

Consumer Perceptions for Rice

When rice is mentioned, majority of the participants associate it with white rice
which have good taste, odor, and texture. Rice was also associated as part of a mea!
that is, always partnered with viand may it be a complicated dish (home-cooked
dishes) or just a simple dish (fried foods). Several participants were knowledgeable
that rice is composed of carbohydrates and that it is healthy in regulated amounts but
can cause weight gain and high blood sugar in excess. Some participants also
associate rice with satiety, that when mentioning rice, they think of the fullness after a
meal. Specifically, a participant mentioned that rice can easily make you full
Sometimes, eating too much rice have an effect on the blood sugar levels. Further,
when you enjoy eating rice meals, your cholesterol levels tend to increase due to
overconsumption of other food items. As a counterargument, another respondent
remarked that Filipinos would not survive without the consumption of rice. | think rice
is good for the health especially when eaten in moderation. If we do not eat rice, we
will not have enough energy to go on through the day. In contrast, some associate it
with hunger, that when rice is mentioned, they think that it is time for eating and that
they are already hungry, specifically saying that / fee! hunger when rice is mentioned
! always associate rice with mealtimes that is why when rice is mentioned | think that

itis time to eat

Typically Consumed Type of Rice

Commonly consumed type of rice at home were different varieties of white rice
such as National Food Authority (NFA), Jasmine, Dinorado, Maharlika, Angelica,
Sinandomeng, and Milagrosa. Reasons for choosing this type of rice is primarily due
to affordability and availability, specifically mentioning that we buy any type as long as.
it's white, while another stated that we choose cheap rice so that we have more budget
for other food items. Several mentioned that of the varieties of rice in the market, only
white rice have wide range to choose from both in terms of quality and price and that
white rice has the cheapest and most affordable variety. Brown rice is seldom seen
by the participants, especially in wet markets and this was seen as a hindrance in the
consumption of brown rice. Also, participants opt to choose rice which is tasty, have
good odor, soft when cooked, easy to prepare, and complements the taste of the
viand. A participant also mentioned not buying brown rice because their household
members were not familiar with brown rice and majority of the participants agreed that
white rice was chosen since it has been customary to consume white rice since their
childhood days. Lastly, participants choose rice which is acceptable to other family
members (children, spouse, and others) since it would be difficult to prepare separate

types of rice when one family member dislikes a specific type of rice.

Consumer Perceptions for Brown Rice

Consumer perceptions for brown rice varies from one person to another.
Several participants mentioned that brown rice was generally acceptable in terms of
taste and texture especially those belonging to the SE group. A general comment
would be that brown rice is acceptable when we tasted it moments ago but from what

95

| know, brown rice is expensive that is why we don't buy that type of rice. Still, many
participants deemed brown rice as inferior to white rice due to its taste and texture as
well as it does not complement the flavor of the viand partnered to it (bland taste).
Specifically a participant from the SE group mentioned that when / tasted brown rice,
the texture is rough and | do not like the odor of two out of the three samples. | also
do not like the taste. In my opinion, white rice is better. Furthermore, majority of the
participants finds brown rice unacceptable due to its high price as compared to white
tice and that its affordability was one of the determining factors in its acceptability,
even though many participants were aware of its nutrient content and health benefits.
Still, many participants associate brown rice to people with NCDs such as diabetes.
Several mentioned that the quality of brown rice does not match its price and that they
will continue to purchase white rice even if they know that brown rice is healthy.
Several participants were also not aware of brown rice or have not tasted brown rice

previously, limiting their opinions and acceptability of brown rice.

Factors Affecting Acceptability of Brown Rice

According to the participants, price was one of the major determining factor in
the acceptability of brown rice. Price limits the capacity of the participants to purchase
brown rice which leads to not tasting or trying brown rice and eventually, not including
brown rice in their daily meals. Participants mentioned that many were still not familiar
with brown rice in general and that many were still not aware of the health benefits of
brown rice. A participant mentioned that some people are not aware of brown rice.
Also, | think brown rice is not different from white rice, only more expensive. On the
other hand, for those familiar with brown rice, they associate it with NCDs and people

96

of the upper class, stating that only those who have high socioeconomic status can
purchase brown rice. Also, availability in the local wet markets is another factor
affecting acceptability. Participants mentioned that brown rice is only available in
supermarkets and not in wet markets, and since majority of the participants buy their
food in the wet markets, they are not able to purchase brown rice. An overall remark
would be that many people only know white rice. In the market, white rice have a lot
of varieties, some expensive some are not, for brown rice, it is only expensive and we
do not have a lot of choices. Apart from affordability, familiarity, and availability, taste
is another factor considered by the participants in choosing brown rice. Brown rice is
deemed inferior to white rice primarily due to its color (which some participants
perceives as dirty), texture (rough), and taste (bland). A participant particularly
mentioned that / do not mind eating brown rice especially since it is healthy, except
for its price. However, white rice is tastier than brown rice. Although some participants
mentioned that brown rice was acceptable, several participants still mentioned that it
is bland and it does not complement the viand well, making it unacceptable. Other
factors affecting the acceptability of rice include ease of preparation and acceptance
of household members especially among children. The factors affecting the
acceptability of brown rice enumerated by the participants shows that acceptability is
not a result of a single factor but of several interrelated factors affecting the

purchasing, cooking, tasting, and regular consumption of brown rice.

Willingness to Switch to Brown Rice

Participants were asked of their willingness to switch to brown rice when stated
that there are studies saying that brown rice is healthier as compared to white rice.
Decisions of the participants for switching to brown rice were diverse — some were
willing to switch conditionally, some were not willing, while some were still undecided.
Willingness to switch to brown rice was dictated by the major barriers affecting
acceptability of brown rice such as taste, affordability, and acceptance of other
household members. Some participants were willing to switch to brown rice if the price
is lower but several mentioned that they were willing to switch but they will not
consume brown rice on a regular basis due to its high price. They suggested eating
brown rice twice or thrice a week or mixing white rice with brown rice to lessen its cost.
A remarkable qualitative statement would be that we are willing to eat brown rice but
due to its high price, we cannot accommodate it in our budget. In one kilo of brown
rice, we can already buy two kilos of white rice. It is not practical to buy brown rice.
But if we have a choice, we will choose brown rice because it is healthier. But due to
its impracticality, we will not choose it and we will opt for other nutritious foods that are
affordable such as vegetables. We can plant vegetables or we can get it cheaply,
against buying expensive rice where you are left with nothing to buy other food items.
Generally, willingness to switch to brown rice completely is still a long and tedious
process due to the major barriers in the acceptability of brown rice which limits the

participants’ capacity to consume brown rice.

For the SE group, an additional question on the willingness to switch to brown

rice especially after tasting brown rice was asked. Several participants affirmed their

98

willingness to switch to brown but only after their household members also accept the
taste and also when the price of brown rice levels with white rice. Some were
undecided, claiming that we cannot decide now because | have not yet considered
our budget at home, and | am still not sure if my family would like brown rice. \n this
case, willingness to switch to brown rice is not only affected by taste alone but also of
several other factors such as price, acceptance of the family, and availability which

makes the participants hesitant to change to brown rice.

Ways to Convince Others to Eat Brown Rice

Primary convincing factors for brown rice was its health benefits (Say that
brown rice is good for the health even though it is expensive) although several
participants agreed that it was difficult to convince other people to eat brown rice when
they, themselves, were not convinced in consuming brown rice. Some participants
mentioned that brown rice was as good as white rice especially when consumers get
familiar with its taste. This can be facilitated by reducing its market price. Research on
the health benefits of brown rice, specifically the detailed nutrients which can be
obtained from eating brown rice may also help others consume brown rice (Also inform
the people that brown rice is healthy and what specific nutrients can it provide since
that's what they are paying for). Also, some participants mentioned that a convincing
statement depends on the age, sex, health consciousness and state of health (with
NCDs or without) of the person being convinced. Statements should be targeted
based on similar characteristics and values of groups of individuals being convinced,
for example, stating the health benefits for health conscious individuals and those with

NCDs.

People who can Incorporate Brown Rice in Daily Meals

When asked which group of people can incorporate brown rice in their daily
meals, majority of the participants mentioned only those with high income or
socioeconomic status, health conscious, individuals with NCDs, and elderly people
can incorporate brown rice in their daily meals primarily due to their capacity to buy
and their need for additional nutrients. A participant mentioned that she thinks that
those who are middle to upper class, can eat brown rice every day. In contrast, another
participant mentioned that brown rice can be consumed by normal people (middle
class citizens) if the price is reduced. Some participants also stated that only those
who likes the taste of brown rice can regularly consume brown rice but normal (or the
general public) can also consume brown rice regularly, provided that the market price

of brown rice is low or at the same level with white rice.

Suggestions to Improve Brown Rice

Suggestions to improve brown rice would be to conduct a massive information
campaign for the consumers to know the health benefits of brown rice, provide free
samples to consumers or let the consumers try brown rice so that they can know the
taste of brown rice, improve the taste of brown rice particularly the flavor, lower the
price of brown rice in the market to the same price of white rice varieties, and to make
it available in local wet markets and not only in supermarkets. Specifically, a
participant mentioned that people should also be given the chance to try brown rice
since there are still many who have not tasted it and do not plan to taste or try it due
to its price. Maybe if they will know the taste, it will be acceptable to them along with
the reduction of its price. However, most participants remarked that the price should

100

be reduced because even if they know that itis healthy, if they do not have the capacity

to buy it, then they will still not consume it regularly.

CHAPTER V
DISCUSSION

This study aimed to determine the consumer acceptability and perceptions for
brown rice among household heads in selected barangays in Caloocan City. Also,
the study ascertained the level of knowledge of the respondents with regards to the
nutritional properties and attributes of brown rice. Furthermore, the significant factors
associated with the consumer acceptability of brown rice were ascertained using
multiple binary logistic regression. The study achieved these objectives through
quantitative and qualitative data collection (Phase |: Survey and Consumer

Acceptability Test; and Phase II: FGDs) from the household heads in Caloocan City.

Rice is a dietary staple food and one of the most important cereal crops,
especially for people in Asia (Rohman et al., 2014). In the Philippines, rice is
customarily part of a meal. During the 2013 NNS, it was revealed that cereal and
cereal products (majority of which is rice) constitute 40.3 % of the mean one-day per
capita food intake of Filipinos (FNRI-DOST, 2014). However, the most commonly
consumed type of rice is still white rice, the regular consumption of which, is
associated with NCDs and their risk factors such as T2DM, obesity or high BMI, CHD,
and ischemic stroke (Hu et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2013; Liang et al.,
2013). Regular brown rice consumption in Asia, specifically in the Philippines, is stil
low due to several factors affecting its acceptability such as the attributes of brown
rice (sensory attributes, cost, ease of preparation), individual characteristics

(knowledge on the nutritional properties of brown rice, customs/tradition, health

102

consciousness), and household characteristics (household income, household size,

daily food expenditure).

Subject Profile

Generally, a majority of the households deem females as their household
heads (67.1 %), indicating the important role of women in food purchasing and
preparation. A majority of the household heads had normal nutritional status (59.6 %),
but significant percentage of the respondents were overweight (24.7 %) and obese
(8.6 %). Nutritional status influences food choices and specifically, the acceptability of
brown rice. It also affects the knowledge on the nutritional properties of brown rice,

health consciousness, and consumer perceptions for brown rice.

Mean household income was at PhP 21,293.5 while mean monthly food
expenditure was at PhP 8,266.2. This implies that almost half of the mean monthly
household income was allocated for food, with the mean daily expenditure for rice at
PhP 72.5, which is equivalent to two kilos of rice per day. Food choices are affected
by the purchasing power of an individual or a household. Results of previous studies
were contrasting, indicating that household income was not associated with brown
rice acceptability (Danso-Abbeam et al., 2012) and also highlighting that household
income has significant effects on the acceptability of brown rice (Danquah and Egyir

2014)

Majority of the respondents had supportive customsj/traditions with regards to
brown rice (76.5 %). Tradition, experience, and history play a major role in the
perception of brown rice, for example, Vietnamese participants regarded brown rice

103

negatively due to its association with a period of poverty in Vietnam (Phan et al., 2012;
Kumar et al., 2011). Participants from the studies by Kumar et al. (2011) and Zhang
et al. (2010) stated that until all household members were willing to accept any of
these varieties of brown rice, it would be difficult to give up the highly polished rice

that people were used to eating.

Lastly, more than half of the respondents (56.9 %) were health conscious.
Health consciousness directly affects acceptability and consumption of brown rice. In
several FGDs, it was revealed that self-proclaimed health conscious individuals tend
to have higher acceptability scores compared to those who did not deem themselves

as health conscious (Muhihi et al., 2013)

Consumer Acceptability Test

Since brown rice is being promoted as a healthier alternative for white rice,
several quantitative and qualitative studies have been conducted to ascertain the
acceptability of brown rice both in Asian and in Western populations. However, all
previous studies utilized convenience sampling with small sample sizes among trained
or untrained panelists which would have affected the results of the study. For this
study, among untrained panelists, the overall acceptability of brown rice (using three
samples) was comparatively lower as compared to white rice (control). For the
different attributes of rice such as color and appearance, odor, taste, and texture, the
mean Hedonic ratings for brown rice ranged from 4.6 to 6.1 points, which are relatively
lower as compared to white rice (7.2 to 7.7 points). Furthermore, the overall

acceptability of brown rice was lower at 5.0, 5.2, and 6.0 points for Samples A, B, and

104

C, respectively, which were also relatively lower as compared to white rice (7.7 points)
Sensory attributes and the overall acceptability of brown rice were significantly lower

(in all three samples) when compared to white rice using Dunnett's test.

The results of this study mirrored the results of other studies conducted in
several countries, which revealed that brown rice was generally acceptable but ratings
for brown rice were significantly lower compared to other carbohydrate sources such
as white rice. Additionally, a number of the studies showed that white rice is still more
preferred by the consumers as compared to brown rice (Sareepuang et al., 2008;
Sudha et al., 2013; Ebuehi and Oyewole 2007; Muhihi et al., 2013; Shobana et al.,

2011; Monge-Rojas et al., 2014).

For this study, the use of untrained panelists implicates the general
acceptability of brown rice in an unbiased population, which could reflect the actual
acceptability of brown rice at the individual level. However, the lack of inclusion and
exclusion criteria limited the results of the study since some respondents were not
familiar or have not encountered brown rice in the past, thereby affecting their answers
in Phase | and Phase Il. Also, previous exposure or experience to brown rice may also
bias the ratings of the panelists during the consumer acceptability test. Aside from
these, several cultural factors may have affected the scores of the respondents that

were not taken into consideration during the data collection.

With regards to the samples used, the samples were obtained from the

supermarket and local wet market. Although the study proponent has ensured that all

105

samples were produced or processed at the same time, several extrinsic and intrinsic
factors may have affected the quality of the rice. Specifically, rice from supermarkets
has undergone different processing and packaging procedures while the sample from
the local wet market was directly sourced from the rice millers. Also, the level of bran
(or the polishing degree) of the brown rice was not ascertained in the study, which
may have affected the acceptability. The higher acceptability of Sample C may be
explained by its freshness, amylose level, or the degree of polishing, which were not

ascertained in the study.

Although several studies have ascertained the acceptability of rice, the conduct
of consumer acceptability tests using rice alone may not capture the actual
acceptability of rice. This is due to the fact that rice is not consumed alone but is
always partnered with viands or other food items. The use of rice alone in this study
may not have ascertained the actual acceptability since panelists were not able to
determine the sensory attributes of brown rice when partnered with a viand. In the
study by Sudha et al. (2013), the rice samples were partnered with “sambar", which is
a gravy dish made from lentils and vegetables cooked in a spicy tamarind sauce. This
may be effective in determining the actual acceptability of brown rice, however, since
the Philippine cuisine is very much varied, several considerations are still needed
before settling with the use of a specific type of viand. Also, different cultural factors
regarding rice may have affected the ratings since some value the quality of rice more

than the viand while others value the quality of the viand as compared to rice.

Knowledge on the Nutritional Properties and Attributes of Brown Rice

Several qualitative and quantitative studies have found out that a contributing
factor to the low acceptability of brown rice is the lack of familiarity and promotion of
the nutritive value of brown rice (Danquah et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010; Kumar et
al., 2011). In the current study, the mean knowledge test score was 53.7 percent with
a minimum score of 0.0 percent and a maximum score of 93.3 percent. Majority of the
respondents were familiar that brown rice is more nutritious (i.e., contains more
vitamins and minerals) as compared to white rice. Also, respondents were familiar that
brown rice has beneficial effects on blood sugar control, cholesterol levels, and vitamin
B deficiency. However, a majority of the respondents were not familiar that brown rice
is not a good source of protein, that brown rice and white rice may come from the
same plant source, and that a cup of brown rice and white rice have the same caloric

content.

Although it cannot be concluded that the respondents have limited knowledge
or awareness on the nutritional properties or attributes of brown rice, the low scores
for some questions may be a factor in the acceptability of brown rice in the population.
Limited awareness of the nutritional properties of brown rice resulted in lower
acceptability scores among Indian respondents (Sudha et al., 2013). In contrast,
higher knowledge on the nutritional properties of brown rice resulted in higher
consumer acceptability scores as exhibited in the study by Shobana et al. (2011).
which revealed a higher consumer rating for the overall acceptability for brown rice

given that the panelists were more knowledgeable on the nutritional properties and

IS

health benefits of brown rice since most have come from the food sciences
background.

These findings were also supported by the qualitative studies (FGDs)
conducted by Kumar et al. (2011), which stated that apart from color, size, texture,
and habit, another major barrier to the acceptance of brown rice was poor awareness
about it and its nutritive properties. In contrast, the FGD conducted by Phan et al.
(2010) among Vietnamese and American adults revealed that majority of the
participants were aware that brown rice contains more nutritional value compared to

white rice.

Despite having an effect on the acceptability of brown rice, knowledge and
awareness are still affected by different cultural and social factors, which may

determine the level of knowledge and awareness of an individual

Factors Affecting Acceptability of Brown Rice

The food choice process is complex, dynamic and situational, and the value
assigned to each food is defined by a personal food system (Commors et al., 2001).
The results of this study showed that household heads in Caloocan City define their
personal food system primarily based on three values: color and appearance, taste,
and cost of rice, which were all significant factors influencing the consumer

acceptability of brown rice.

Crude associations revealed that the sensory attributes (color, appearance,
odor, taste, and texture) and the cost of brown rice were significantly associated with
the acceptability of brown rice. This is in line with several studies conducted in other

108

countries indicating that attributes of brown rice (sensory attributes, cost, ease of
preparation), individual characteristics (knowledge of the nutritional properties of
brown rice, customsj/tradition, health consciousness of an individual, consumer
perception), and household characteristics (household income, household size,
monthly expenditure on food) utlimatedly determine the acceptance of consumers of
a food product, specifically brown rice (Zhang et al., 2010; Ahmad Hanis et al., 2012;

Danquah and Egyir 2014; Phan et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2011).

On the other hand, determination of binary associations using multiple logistic
regression analysis revealed that color and appearance, taste, and price were
associated with the consumer acceptability of brown rice. Specifically, the odds of
acceptability of brown rice was 11 times higher if the consumer likes the color and
appearance of rice (OR = 10.76, 95 %CI: 2.50; 46.27), 20 times higher if the consumer
likes the taste of rice (OR = 19.80; 95 %CI: 2.99; 131.15), and ten times higher when
price is acceptable to the consumer (OR = 21.29; 95 %CI: 3.87; 117.25). This is
supported by a study conducted in China, which revealed the same associations
indicating that taste, texture, appearance, and cost were the main factors influencing
brown rice consumption (Zhang et al., 2012). Other studies conducted in Egypt and
India also supported this finding, indicating that sensory attributes ultimately determine

the acceptability of brown rice (Danquah and Egyir 2014; Kumar et al. 2011).

Although the study attempted to enumerate and determine alll significant factors
associated with the consumer acceptability of brown rice, there are still many other

cultural, behavioral and social factors that were not ascertained in this study. The

109

intensive review of related literature resulted in a list of all covariates associated with
the consumer acceptability of brown rice, but there may be other literatures that
enumerate several other factors. The behavioral nature of this study implicates that
despite the results, there are still other behavioral factors which should be taken into
consideration before generalizing the results. Also, confounders were not controlled
in this study, which could have an effect on the overall consumer acceptability of brown

rice and can also be associated with the different covariates.

Also, although a target of 634 respondents was computed for ascertaining the
outcome and the exposure variables, logistical and financial barriers hindered
conducting the consumer acceptability test (which was the source of data for the
outcome) among the targeted sample size. Therefore, exposure variables were
obtained, achieving the target sample size of 634, but the outcome variable (overall
acceptability of brown rice) was only obtained in the subsample of 104 sensory
panelists. This may be the possible reason for the wide Cl range in the factors

associated with consumer acceptability of brown rice

Sensory Attributes of Brown Rice

Preference of rice varies from country to country. In this study, it was found
that the sensory attributes of brown rice (color and appearance, odor, taste, and
texture) were all significantly associated with the consumer acceptability of brown
rice based on crude association, and that color and appearance and taste were
both significantly associated with the consumer acceptability of brown rice.
Among others, this revealed that household heads in Caloocan City value the
appearance and taste of rice, while also taking into consideration the other

110

sensory attributes. High acceptability of color and appearance consequently
resulted to the higher overall acceptability of brown rice. In other studies, similar
results were observed, indicating that appearance (Sudha et al., 2013) and taste
(Danso-Abbeam et al., 2012; Danquah and Egyir 2014) were the most prioritized

characteristics of brown rice affecting the overall consumer acceptability.

Brown rice is generally regarded as dirty, due to its color, and along with the
proliferation of the market with white rice, resulted in lower consumption of brown
rice (ARF, 2001). Also, brown rice has a characteristic nutty flavor, which is
considered as a major barrier to its consumption since a majority of rice eaters
eat rice in partnership with other food items. Therefore, rice should complement

other food items and not overpower their flavor.

Cost

Cost is another emerging barrier to the consumption of brown rice. The cost
was significantly associated with brown consumption among household heads in
Caloocan City, indicating that a higher cost acceptability resulted in a higher
overall consumer acceptability of rice. In the study by Sudha et al. (2013), a
majority of the participants were willing to switch to brown rice if the cost was
affordable. Several FGDs conducted in different populations have also revealed

that cost of brown rice affects its acceptability and the consumers’ food choices.

Consumer Perceptions for Brown Rice

The results of the FGDs supported the results of Phase | of this study. Based
‘on the FGDs, many participants deem brown rice as inferior to white rice due to its
taste and texture. Additionally, it does not complement the flavors of the viand
partnered to it (i.e., bland taste). Also, a majority of the participants finds brown rice
unacceptable due to its high price as compared to white rice and that its affordability
is one of the determining factors in its acceptability, even though many participants
are aware of its nutrient content and health benefits. Specifically, a participant
mentioned that brown rice is acceptable when we tasted it moments ago but from what
| know, brown rice is expensive that is why we don't buy that type of rice. Another
participant mentioned that we do not mind eating brown rice especially since it is
healthy, except for its price. However, white rice is tastier than brown rice. Although
only the sensory attributes of brown rice and its price were found to be significantly
associated with its acceptability, another factor seen as a barrier in the acceptance of
brown rice is its availability in the local markets. A participant particularly mentioned
that many people only know white rice. In the market, white rice have a lot of varieties,
some expensive some are not, for brown rice, it is only expensive and we do not have
a lot of choices. This factor is closely related to the price of rice, in which participants
specified that brown rice is only available in supermarkets and is, therefore, more
expensive as compared to white rice, which is available not only in local wet markets

but also in small stores in their locality.

Although the study by Kumar et al. (2011) in India mentioned that poor
awareness about brown rice and its nutritive properties was a major barrier in the

112

consumption of brown rice, participants for the FGD generally knew that brown rice is
healthy, however, they still recommended information campaign on the specific
nutrients, which can be obtained from brown rice. To support this, a participant
specifically responded that some people are not aware of brown rice. Also, | think
brown rice is not different from white rice, only more expensive. Despite several
factors enumerated, which inhibit the consumption of rice, price or affordability is still
the major concern. Among consumers in India, white rice is associated with higher
socioeconomic status (Sudha et al., 2013), which is opposite to the perception of
Filipinos with white rice. In the Philippines, white rice is cheaper compared with other
varieties of rice and FGD participants even associates white rice with affordability. On
the other hand, associating brown rice as the choice of those with higher
socioeconomic status (with participants mentioning that only those who are middle to
upper class, can eat brown rice every day) leads to a conclusion that only those who

have a high socioeconomic status can incorporate brown rice in their daily meals.

Majority of the FGD participants mentioned that white rice is the customary type
of rice and switching to brown rice may be difficult due to its taste and price. Generally,
willingness to switch to brown rice completely is still a long and tedious process due
to the major barriers in the acceptability of brown rice that limits the participants’
capacity to consume brown rice. Suggestions to improve brown rice includes massive
information campaign for the consumers to know the health benefits of brown rice,
provision of free samples to consumers or let the consumers try brown rice so that
they can know the taste of brown rice, improve the taste of brown rice particularly the
flavor, lower the price of brown rice in the market to the same price of white rice

113

varieties, and make it available in local wet markets and not only in supermarkets.
Despite this, as stated by Kumar et al. (2013), the change in the types of rice
consumed is likely to be met with resistance and will require continued reinforcement

of positive messages aimed at enhancing people's acceptance of brown rice.

CHAPTER VI
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS,

Summary

This study aimed to determine the consumer acceptability and perceptions for
brown rice among household heads in selected barangays in Caloocan City. The
study revealed that the acceptability of brown rice was lower as compared to white
rice, with significant mean differences in the consumer acceptability of the sensory
attributes and the overall acceptability of brown rice (p-vaue<0.0001). Knowledge
scores on the nutritional properties of brown rice and its attributes were low, with mean

percentage scores of 53.7 percent.

When the different covariates were tested for significance, it was revealed that
price, color and appearance, and taste dictated the overall acceptability of brown rice
among consumers. Specifically, the odds of acceptability of brown rice is 11 times
higher if the consumer likes the color and appearance of rice (OR: 10.76, 95%Cl: 2.50;
46.27), 20 times higher if the consumer likes the taste of rice (OR: 19.80; 95%CI: 2.99;
131.15), and 10 times higher when price is acceptable to the consumer (OR: 21.29;

95%CI: 3.87; 117.25).

On the other hand, other factors associated with the acceptability of brown rice
as based on the qualitative FGDs were awareness of the nutritional properties of
brown rice, availability of brown rice in local wet markets, familiarity with brown rice,

and the acceptability of brown rice to other family members, among others.

Conclusion

The emerging problem of overnutrition is affected by several factors, primarily
by food habits. In the Philippines, rice is customarily part of a meal. During the 2013
NNS, it was revealed that cereal and cereal products (including rice) constitutes 40.3
percent of the mean one-day per capita food intake of Filipinos (FNRI-DOST, 2014).
However, the most commonly consumed type of rice is still white rice, which is
associated with NCDs and their risk factors such as T2DM; obesity or high BMI; CHD;
and ischemic stroke (Hu et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2013; Liang et al.,
2013). Brown rice consumption in Asia is still relatively low due to the low acceptability

of this this type of rice among the population.

Preference for rice vary from country to country and across cultures. The
current study revealed that household heads in Caloocan City still prefer white rice as
compared to brown rice. Brown rice received lower Hedonic ratings at 4.6 to 6.1 points
as compared to white rice at 7.2 to 7.7 points in terms of color and appearance, odor,
taste, and texture. Furthermore, the overall acceptability of brown rice was lower at
5.0, 5.2, and 6.0 points for Samples A, B, and C, respectively; which were also
relatively lower as compared to white rice (7.7 points). Sensory attributes and the
overall acceptability of brown rice were significantly lower (in all three samples) when

compared to white rice using Dunnett's Test.

Acceptability of brown rice is determined by several factors. Since local studies
on the acceptability of brown rice are limited, the study provided significant data that

shows that brown rice is still less acceptable as compared to white rice when mean

116

Hedonic ratings are considered. This study revealed that several factors such as color
and appearance, taste and cost of brown rice were all significantly associated with the

overall consumer acceptability of brown rice.

In conclusion, this study provided concrete factors which affects the
acceptability of rice. Apart from the quantitative significant findings, qualitative data
from the FGDs revealed several other factors associated with the acceptability of
brown rice. Major determining factor in the consumption of brown rice based on the
qualitative FGDs was the awareness of the nutritional properties of brown rice,
availability of brown rice in local wet markets, familiarity with brown rice, taste of brown
rice and the acceptability of brown rice to other family members, among others.
Despite the numerous factors tested for association in this study, there may still be
other significant factors which may play a significant role in the acceptability of brown

rice.

Recommendations

For future researches, it should be noted that this study has only been
conducted in a single urban city in the Philippines. Results of this study may not be
generalizeable outside Caloocan City and may need further regional and national
research studies in which the data can be applied to the entire population. Also,
several unknown factors may also have an effect in the consumer acceptability of
brown rice and it would be vital to determine these factors. Food preference is a
complex process and the consumer acceptability of rice may be a result of various

interrelated factors.

IN

Brown tice is less acceptable as compared to white rice, as revealed by this
study. Also, knowledge levels on the nutritional propertis and attibutes of brown rice
were also found to be relatively low in this study. Therefore, several interventions may
be done to promote brown rice along with the promotion of healthy diets among
households across all age groups. Several studies have revealed that consumption of
brown rice is associated with better nutritional outcomes but the principles of a healthy
diet should always be taken into consideration when consuming a meal. This involves
balance, variety, and moderation, indicating that any excess in consumption will

eventually lead to diseases, no matter how healthy the food item is.

January 2018

This informed consent form is intended for the household heads and will encompass the
participation of the of the household in the study “Factors affecting acceptability and consumer
perceptions for brown rice among households in selected barangays in Caloocan City.”

This Informed Consent Form has two parts:

1. Information Sheet (discussing information about the research)
2. Certificate of Consent (for signatures if you agree to take part in the study)

You will be given a copy of the full Informed Consent Form
Part |: Information Sheet

Dear household head,

| am a student at the University of the Philippines Manila taking up MS in Public Health
(Nutrition). In line with the curriculum of the program, | am conducting a study on the
acceptability of brown rice in Caloocan City which aims to determine the factors associated
with the acceptability of cooked brown rice and consumer perceptions for brown rice
Promotion of brown rice has been done in the Philippines since the early 2000s but data on
the acceptability and deterring factors affecting its consumption is still lacking. Therefore, this
study is pioneering and will provide a baseline data for policy makers and health professionals.
The study will be accomplished in 10 months, from ethical review until the approval of results
by a technical panel

This study will include the following phases:

Phase! Face-to-face interviews (which will take at most 20 minutes) which will include
collection of household information and knowledge assessment (in 634 Caloocan
City households)

Sensory evaluation which includes tasting and rating of brown rice samples. The
sensory evaluation will only be done by 100 randomly selected eligible individuals
who finished the face-to-face interviews and the sensory evaluation area would be
in the barangay hall. Ample time will be given to participants to complete the
sensory evaluation

Phase — Focus group discussions (FGDs) will be done among several groups with similar
u characteristics (based on age, gender, and nutritional status). A total of 16 groups
with 6-8 members per group will be asked to participate in the study (8 groups from
those who participated in the sensory evaluation and 8 groups from those who did
not). Topics to be discussed include perceptions on brown rice, main barriers on

129

the consumption of brown rice, and suggestions for improving brown rice. FGDs
will be recorded verbatim. Each FGD session will take about 30 to 45 minutes,
depending on the level of participation of the participants.

Should you allow to participate in the study, | will collect data regarding your household profile
and you will have a chance to be chosen for the sensory evaluation and FGDs. The data
collected will help to understand and improve the factors associated with acceptability of
brown rice among households. There may not be any benefit to you or the society at this stage
of the research, but future generations are likely to benefit from the results of this study.

If you participate in this study, it is possible to have allergic reactions to brown rice
consumption in the sensory evaluation part. Symptoms of allergy include diarrhea, flatulence
or a bloated feeling, abdominal pain, and nausea. While the possibility of allergies is
uncommon especially in adults, you should still be aware of the possibility. If something
unexpected happens, | will provide you with medical assistance and treatment until the allergic
reaction subsides.

Please be assured that information that will be obtained through the study will remain
confidential and will be used only for the purpose indicated in the study. Households and
respondents will not be identified by name but will be number coded. Forms will be kept in a
locked cabinet and will only be made available to the research team, and the participants upon
approval by the study team and relevant authorities. Participants of the study will be provided
information sheets summarizing the major findings of the study, after the deliberation and
approval of a technical panel of the presentation of study results. Full report on the findings in
the study may be requested from the principal investigator, subsequent to the publication of
results in a peer-reviewed scientific journal

Participation in this study is voluntary and you may freely drop out anytime during the study
without any penalty

‘A small token in the form of food packs will be given only to those who completed the sensory
evaluation and FGDs.

This research has been reviewed and approved by the UP Manila Research Ethics Board
(UPMREB) ~ Ethics Review Panel, which is a committee whose task it is to make sure that
research participants are protected from harm. The UPMREB may be contacted for
information regarding rights of study participants, including grievances and complaints

Mga household head,

Ako ay mag-aaral ng MS in Public Health (Nutrition) sa University of the Philippines Manila.
Kaugnay ng kurikulum para sa aking kurso, ako ay magsasagawa ng saliksik tungkol sa
pagtanggap sa brown rice sa Caloocan City na naglalayon na matukoy ang mga salik sa
Pagtanggap ng brown rice at ang consumer perceptions para sa brown rice. Ang promotion
ng brown rice ay isinasagawa na sa Pilipinas mula pa noong taong 2000 ngunit mayroon pa
ring kakulangan sa datos ukol sa pagtanggap dito pati na rin ang mga partikular na dahilan
ng hindi pagkonsumo nito. Dahil dito, ang pag-aaral na ito ay gagawin upang magkaroon ng
lokal na datos and Pilipinas ukol sa acceptability at consumer perception ng brown rice na
makatututlong upang makagawa ng nararapat na batas sa pag-promote nito. Ang pag-aaral
na ito ay matatapos sa loob ng 10 buwan, simula sa ethical review hanggang sa pag-aapruba
ng resulta ng pag-aaral

‘Ang pag-aaral na ito ay may dalawang bahagi

Phase! Harapang panayam (na tatagal ng di lalampas sa 20 minuto) kung saan aalamin
ang mga impormasyon ukol sa household, pati na rin ang patukoy sa kaalaman
tungkol sa brown rice ng household head (sa 634 households sa Caloocan City)

Sensory evaluation kung saan titikman at mamarkahan ang lutong brown rice
samples base sa iba't ibang katangian. Ang sensory evaluation ay gagawin
lamang ng 100 tao na pinili ng random mula sa mga nakatapos ng panayam.
‘Ang sensory evaluation ay gagawin sa barangay hall. Bibigyan ng sapat na oras
ang mga kalahok para matapos ang sensory evaluation.

Phase Il Focus group discussions (FGDs) ay gagawin sa ilang grupo na may katulad na
katangian (edad, kasarian, at nutritional status. May kabuuan na 16 na grupo na
may 6-8 na miyembro ang makikilahok sa FGD (8 grupo mula sa mga
nagsensory evaluation at 8 mula sa hindi). Ang mga tatalakaying paksa ay
tungkol sa perceptions sa brown rice, mga pangunahing salik sa hindi pagkain

132

ng brown rice at mga mungkahi kung papaano mapapataas ang bilang ng
kumakain ng brown rice. Ang lahat ng FGDs ay irerekord. Ang FGD ay
magtatagal ng 30 hanggang 45 minuto, depende sa lebel ng partisipasyon ng
mga kalahok sa pag-uusap.

Kung sakaling kayo ay pumayag sa pagsali, ako ay lilikom ng datos ukol sa inyong household,
at maaari rin kayong mapili upang sumali sa sensory evaluation at FGDs. Ang malilikom na
impormasyon ay makatutulong sap ag-intindi at pag-aayos sa mga salik sa acceptability ng
brown rice sa mga household. Wala man direktang benepisyo ito sa inyo at sa lipunan ang

that respondents are only giving out information because they trust you and the research team
you work for. Prior to the interview, you are mandated to always guarantee respondents that
the information they provide will be kept strictly anonymous and confidential, and will be used
for analysis purposes only.

APPENDIX 8

Typical Meal
‘Female/31 years old/Normal NS

“Sa akin, pag sinabing “meal” ang naiisip ko ay prutas, chicken, gulay tapos with rice, yung
complete na pagkain.”

(‘When meal is mentioned, | think of a complete meal, which included fruits, chicken, vegetables
with rice.)

Male/20 years old/Normal NS

“Sa bahay di pwedeng ok lang yung ulam, dapat masarap, kadalasan naggugulay kami pero
may baboy din, para sa mga bata, ang laging kinakain niyan ay mga processed foods, hotdog,
longganisa, mga ganyan. Saka mahilig din kami sa prutas pero madalas saging lang ang
nabibil.”

(‘We always prefer flavorful dishes and not settle with just right taste. At home, we usually eat
processed foods such as hotdog and longganisa, due to the food preference of the children.

We also like fruits, but we settle with banana since it is the only fruit usually available.)

Factors Considered When Buying Food
Female/31 years old/Normal NS
“Ako pag bumibili siyempre yung masustansya pero mura, mahirap na ang buhay ngayon pero
kahit papaano naman may mabibiling mura pero okay na.”

(‘We consider nutritional value and price. We need to prioritize with the budget so we choose

_cheaper food items with good quality.) _
Female/38 years old/Normal NS
“Kami madalas naming isinasaalang alang kung masustansiya, pero siyempre dapat kaya din
ng budget. Kaya madalas gulay ang kinakain namin kasi yun yung mura at masustansiya

(We consider healthy foods, however, we also take into consideration our budget. That is why
_we always opt to eat vegetables since vegetables are cheap and healthy’ _

‘Male/66 years old/Overweight NS

“Sa amin naman, yung lasa ang priority. Kasi di ka naman mabubusog kung kaunti lang

makakain mo kasi di masarap yung pagkain.”

(“For our family, taste is the priority. We want to feel longer satiety with the food we eat and we
can achieve it by choosing tasty food items.)

Female/44 years old/Overweight NS

“Samin po presyo kasi mahirap na po ang buhay ngayon, mahal magpaaral ng mga bata at
dapat sapat din ang kinakain at masarap, kaya namang pagsabayin. Meron namang mura at
masarap.”

(‘For us, we prionitize price to make ends meet. We also budget on the education of our
children but we do not compromise the quality of food they eat. Through proper budgeting and

choices, we can obtain cheap food which is also tasty.

Consumer Perceptions for
Female/36 years old/Overweight NS

“Sobrang nakakabusog kaya minsan nakakataas din ng blood sugar, tapos dahil napapasarap
sa ulam, tataas cholesterol mo.”

ice

("it [ice] can easily make you full. Sometimes, eating too much rice have an effect on the blood
sugar levels. Further, when you enjoy eating rice meals, your cholesterol levels tend to increase
due to overconsumption of foods.)

‘Male/55 years old/Overweight NS

“Pero di naman siguro tayo mabubuhay pag walang kanin diba. Maganda din naman siya sa
kalusugan, basta hinay hinay lang. Kasi pag di tayo kumain ng kanin, manghihina tayo. Parang
dirin kumain yun.”

(‘We would not survive without the consumption of rice. | think rice is good for the health
especially when eaten in moderation. iff we do not eat rice, we will not have enough energy to
goon through the day.)

Female/39 years old/Normal NS

“Maganda, masarap, masustansya yung kanin, kulang ang kain pag walang kanin.”

(Rice is both healthy and delicious, a meal is not complete if rice is not included.")

‘Female/69 years old/Normal NS

“Nakakagutom yung kanin, parang pag sinabing kanin, kakain na, o kaya maghahain na kasi
gutom na.”

(‘Ifeel hunger when rice is mentioned. | always associate rice with mealtimes that is why when
_tice is mentioned | think that it is time to eat’)

Female/51 years old/Overweight NS

“Sang ayon ako diyan, dapat yung pinipiling bigas yung masarap para yung ulam kahit di
masyado masarap, okay parin, busog pa rin."

(‘I agree, we should choose rice grains which are tasty so that even if the viand is not good, we
would still fee! full and satisfied. ”)
Female/44 years old/Normal NS
*Sakin naman po ang naiisip ko pag kanin ay kapares sa ulam. Di pwedeng kanin lang. dapat
aging may ulam.”

("In my opinion, rice is always associated with viand or home-cooked meals. Rice cannot be

served alone, but always with viands.’)

Typically Consumed Type of Rice

Female/20 years old/Normal NS
“Kahit anong white rice na affordable kasi bibili pa ng ulam eh.”

(Any white rice which is affordable so that we still have budget for other food items.")
Female/27 years old/Normal NS
“Puti rin kasi yun na nakasanayan namin simula pagkabata pa.”

(‘We also buy and eat white rice because that's what we are used to since childhood.)
Female/31 years old/Overweight NS
“Bukod sa nakasanayan, masarap kasi yung puti kahit anong ulam ang isama mo."

(‘Apart from being used to white rice, itis also tasty whatever viand you eat with it")

IS
Io

‘Male/28 years oid/Normal NS
“Sa amin kahit ano basta puti, yung mura lang para makabili ng masarap na ulam.”

(‘For us, we buy any type as long as it's white, we choose cheap rice so that we have more

budget for other food items.")

Female/31 years old/Overweight NS

“Kami din po white rice kasi yun lang kaya naming bilhin, maliit lang budget sa pagkain kasi

naglalaan din kami ng pangpuhunan, pangbaon ng mga bata, at para sa iba pang gastusin sa
ay.”

(‘We also eat white rice since we can only buy white rice due to limited budget for food, Our
budget is allotted not only for food but also for business capital, schoo! allowance for the children,
and for other expenses at home.")

‘Male/45 years old/Normal NS

“Samin naman white rice din kasi yun naman talaga ang binibili na kasi mura, pare-pareho lang
namang bigas yan eh, nakakabusog naman lahat.”

(For us, we also consume white rice due to its affordability, all types of rice are the same, they

all makes us full, so we opt for cheaper rice.

Consumer Perceptions for Brown Rice

Female/42 years old/Normal NS
“Ako di pa ko nakatikim niyan pero nakakita nako. Ang alam ko healthy yan kaya mahal.”

("I haven't tasted brown rice but | have already seen it. From what | know, brown rice is healthy
that is why it is expensive.")
‘Female/26 years old/Normal NS
“Healthy nga kaso mahal tapos yung lasa di magustuhan kasi matabang pero mabigat naman
sa tiyan.”

(‘l agree that it is healthy but it is expensive and the taste is not so good due to its blandness.
But itis heavy on the stomach.")
Female/68 years old/Normal NS
“Okay naman siya nung tinikman namin kanina pero ang pagkakaalam ko diyan mahal siya kaya
nga di kami bumibili eh.”

(‘itis acceptable when we tasted it moments ago but from what | know, brown rice is expensive
that is why we don't buy that type of rice.")_
Male/40 years old/Overweight NS

“Para sa akin matabang tapos mahal ang per kilo. Parang di nga sulit sa presyo.”

(For me, brown rice is bland and expensive. You do not get the quality for what you pay for.)
Female/69 years old/Normal NS
“Masarap nga pero medyo matabang tsaka di ko matantiya kung okay ipartner sa ulam.”

Female/38 years old/Overweight NS
“Kanina nung kumain kami ng brown rice, parang magaspang sa bibig tapos yung dalawa sa
tatlo parang di ko gusto yung amoy. Sa lasa naman, di ko rin masyadong gusto. Mas okay pa
rin yung kulay puti.”

(CA while ago, when we tasted brown rice, the texture is rough and | do not like the odor of two
out of the three samples. | also do not like the taste. In my opinion, white rice is better") _


Female/47 years old/Overweight NS

“Okay sakin yung isang Klase kanina, parang masarap, di ko lang alam kung masarap pag
‘sinamahan ng ulam, para kasing kakanin. Pero ang pagkakaalam ko mahirap lutuin, pero okay
Jang naman kasi naiiwan naman ako sa bahay, kaya naman lutuin.”

(“The variety of brown rice we tasted a while ago is acceptable for me, it seems delicious, but |
am not sure if itis okay to partner with viands since it seems good as it is. But from what | know,
it is dificult to cook but this is fine with me since | am usually left at home and have more time
to prepare food.”)

Female/73 years old/Normal NS

“Alam ko pang may diabetes lang yan, ako wala pa naman diabetes pero matanda na ko, parang
akong kumakain ng jpa diyan sa brown rice, maaligasgas kasi sa bibig.”

(‘I think brown rice is only for diabetics. | still do not have diabetes but ! am already ageing, it
seems like | am eating rice hull when | eat brown rice since it has @ rough texture.")

Female/29 years old/Normal NS

“Mahal yang brown rice, mayayaman lang kumakain nyan.”

(‘Brown rice is expensive, only upper classes eat that.”)

‘Male/35 years old/Normal NS

“Naririnig ko lang yang brown rice, kinakain daw yan nung may mga diabetes, tama ba? Kasi
yung biyenan ko yan na yung kinakain kasi nga may diabetes siya. Gamot daw yan sa diabetes
eh. Nung tinikman ko kanina, medyo okay naman.”

(‘I have already heard about brown rice, it is usually eaten by diabetics, right? My mother-in-law
eats brown rice due to her diabetes. | think brown rice is a cure for diabetes. When | tasted it

earlier, it seems acceptable.)

Factors Affecting Acceptability of Brown Rice
Male/34 years old/Normal NS
“Di siguro alam nung iba gaya ko. Tsaka parang wala naman yatang pinagkaiba sa puti, mas
mahal lang.”

(‘Some people are not aware of brown rice. Also, | think brown rice is not different from white
fice, only more expensive.")
Female/43 years old/Normal NS
*Sa amin naman, willing naman kaming kumain ng brown rice kung mura ang presyo kaso mahal
talaga, di kaya sa budget namin.”

(For us, we are willing to eat brown rice if it is affordable, however, since it is very expensive,
we cannot fit it in our budget.”)

‘Male/20 years old/Normal NS

“Tama, mas mura yung white rice. Alam naman natin yun, praktikal na dapat tayo lalo mahirap
ang buhay, mahal ang mga bilhin.”

(‘I agree, white rice is cheaper. We already know that we should be practical especially now that
the prices of goods are increasing.)

‘Female/45 years old/Normal NS

*Sa amin, mas masarap talaga ang puti, mas mabango pa at mas mura.”

(‘For us, we think white rice is more tasty, have good odor, and also cheaper.’)


Female/3i years old/Normal NS
“Tsaka kasi nakasanayan na namin ang white rice, hirap na magpalit, baka di pa gusto ng
pamilya ko.”

(‘Also, we are used to eating white rice, itis difficult to change since my family might not like it”)
‘Male/62 years old/Normal NS

“Marami ang di pa nakakakilala sa brown rice, yung iba di pa nga nakakita nun. Tsaka kung
nakatikim na, di naman kaya ng budget.”

(‘There are still many who do not know brown rice, some have not even seen brown rice. And
_for those who have already tasted it, its high price becomes a hindrance.")
1e/44 years old/Normal NS
“Oo nga, mas kilala ng mga tao yung puting kanin, saka sa palengke diba, yung puti lima o higit
pa na klase, may mura may mahal, yung brown rice mahal lang tas wala ka pang pagpipilian.
Wala kaming choices.”

(Right, many people only know white rice. In the market, white rice have a lot of varieties, some
expensive some are not, for brown rice, itis only expensive and we do not have a lot of choices.")

‘Male/55 years old/Overweight NS

“Pag pumunta ka sa palengke, ang makikita mo lang sa lahat ng tindahan ng bigas, white rice.
Kaya anong bibilhin mo? Siyempre kung ano yung nandyan na, yung madaling makita kasi
pangmatagalan, mahihirapan din maghanap ng brown rice, sa supermarket lang ata nabibili
yan.”

(‘When you visit the market, all rice stalls sell white rice. What would you buy? Of course,
‘something that is already there, something easy to access and obtain because in the long run,
it would difficult to find brown rice since it is only usually available in supermarkets.")

Male/40 years old/Overweight NS
“Samin wala naman kaso yung mahal yung brown rice kung masustansiya naman, kaso mas
masarap talaga yung puti."

(‘For us, we do not mind eating brown rice especially since it is healthy, except for its price.
However, white rice is tastier than brown rice.

Female/38 years old/Normal NS
“Nakasanayan nga kasi yung white rice. Kung ako naman ang tatanungin, willing naman ako
magbrown rice pero sa tingin ko di naman magugustuhan ng pamilya ko yan

(‘We are used to eating white rice. If | am asked, | am willing to consume brown rice but | think
my family would not like the taste of brown rice.)

Female/45 years old/Normal NS

“Sang ayon ako diyan, matabang nga, siyempre yung pipiliin mo yung mura tapos masarap at
mabango. Yung brown rice di masarap lalo kapag ulam mo ay may sabaw, kaunti lang tuloy ang
nakakain, tsaka parang mabilis ako magutom pag brown rice ang kinakain ko

(‘I agree with that, it is bland. Of course you will choose something that is cheap and tasty and
without bad odors. Brown rice is not tasty especially with soup-based viands. Because of that,
we only consume meager amounts, also, | feel easily hungry when | eat brown rice.")

Female/31 years old/Normal NS
“Siguro kasi din hindi aware yung mga tao na masustansiya pala yung brown rice kaya kaunti
lang yung sumusubok.”

(‘Maybe some are not aware that brown rice is healthy that is why only a few tries brown rice.’)


Female/66 years old/Normal NS

“Tama, marami nga di pa nakakita ng brown rice, ako nga di pa nakakatikim. Wala namang
commercial sa TV 0 sa radyo na nagsasabi na kumain ng brown rice at masustansiya ito. Sanay
‘na kasi ang marami sa puting bigas at sanay na bulsa namin sa murang bigas.”

(‘I agree, many have not yet seen brown rice, even | have not tasted it. There are no
advertisements on the TV or radio that advises to eat brown rice since it is healthy. Many are
used to eating brown rice since it fits their limited budget perfectly.")

‘Male/66 years old/Overweight NS

“Yan lang naman dahilan eh, dahil sa presyo at sa lasa din, di sanay mga tao sa lasa. Mahirap
‘introduce ang bago kung mayroon ka nang matagal nang nakasanayan."

(‘That is the only reason, due to its price and taste. Many are not used to its taste. It is difficult

to introduce a new type of rice if you are used to eating white rice.”)

Willingness to Switch to Brown Rice
Female/45 years old/Normal NS
“Para sa mga matatanda pwede siguro pero sa tingin ko di magugustuhan ng mga bata kasi nga
matigas at matabang.”

(‘Older persons can regularly eat brown rice but | think younger individuals will not like brown
rice since it is hard to chew and bland.")

Female/31 years old/Normal NS

“Sang-ayon naman ako kasi masustansiya, baka pwede namang masubukan.”

(‘lagree that brown rice is healthy, we may try it.")
‘Male/34 years old/Overweight NS
“Sakin din depende kung masusubukan ko at kung magugustuhan ko yung lasa."

(‘For me, it depends if | would like the taste when | try it.)
Female/63 years old/Normal NS

“Oo nga po, pwede naman, willing naman kami kumain ng brown rice kaso nga sa hirap ng
buhay ngayon, di pasok sa budget yung presyo. Sa isang kilo ng brown dalawang kilo na ng puti
‘ang mabibili ko, hindi na praktikal, pero kung gusto lang, gusto naman namin, sino ba ang ayaw
ng masustansiya? Pero kung di praktikal, marami namang ibang masusustansiyang pagkain na
hindi mahal, tulad ng gulay. Yun pwede mong itanim, libre na, kaysa gagastos ka sa mahal na
bigas tapos wala ka nang pambili ng ulam."

("Yes, we are willing to eat brown rice but due to its high price, we cannot accommodate it in our
budget. In one kilo of brown rice, we can already buy two kilos of white rice. It is not practical to
buy brown rice. But if we have a choice, we will choose brown rice because it is healthier. But
due fo its impracticality, we will not choose it and we will opt for other nutritious foods that are
affordable such as vegetables. We can plant vegetables or we can get it cheaply, against buying
expensive rice where you are left with nothing to buy other food items.") _

Female/73 years old/Normal NS

“Mahirap kasi kahit gusto naman wala naman pambili, di ka rin makakakain kahit sabihin na
masustansiya. Tapos yung lasa pa, di katanggap-tanggap sa marami.”

(‘itis difficult because even if we want it, we do not have the capacity to buy it. We cannot eat it
even though it is healthy. Additionally, the taste is not acceptable to many individuals. ")

183

Female/69 years old/Normal NS

“Hindi ko pa po masabi ngayon kasi hindi ko pa naconsider yung budget namin sa bahay, tsaka
dirrin ako sigurado kung okay lang sa pamilya ko."

(‘I cannot decide now because | have not yet considered our budget at home, and | am still not
sure if my family would like brown rice.")

Female/60 years old/Overweight NS
“Pwede naman mag-adjust kung maibabudget namin ng maayos. Pero di siguro palagi, kasi
‘sobrang mahal pag araw-araw.”

(‘We can adjust our budget accordingly, however, we will not consume it every day since it would
be too expensive.)

Female/47 years old/Overweight NS
“Kami naman, pwede pero hindi siguro palagi kasi mataas ang presyo. Siguro mga twice o thrice
a week lang kung kaya sa budget.”

(For us, it would be alright to eat brown rice but not always due to its price. Maybe we can eat
it twice or thrice a week.") _
‘Male/48 years old/Normal NS
“Siguro, pag may sakit na kakain na ko niyan.”

(‘Maybe when | have an illness, | will eat brown rice.")

Female/20 years old/Normal NS
“Pwede pero di brown rice lang, dapat nga i-mix para di mabigat sa bulsa.”

(‘We can mix brown rice with white rice so that it will not be too expensive.’)

Ways to Convince Others to Eat Brown Rice

‘Female/54 years old/Normal NS
*Sabihin lang na maganda sa kalusugan ang brown rice kahit mahal.”

(Say thay brown rice is good for the health even though it is expensive.)

Female/44 years old/Overweight NS
“Oo nga tapos banggitin na okay naman ang lasa, lalo pag lagi nang kinakain.”

(Yes and then mention that the taste is fine, especially when you get used to i’)

Female/28 years old/Normal NS

“Pwede din imarket muna sa mga may sakit kasi sila naman makakabenepisyo, sabihin na
nakakabawas sa sakit at nakakapayat kasi kahit kaunti lang mabubusog ka na.”

(it can also be marketed first to those with illness since it can benefit them, say that it can help
alleviate their ilness and can reduce weight since even in small amounts, you will already fee!
full”) _
Male/21 years old/Normal NS
“Depende kung sino ang ikukumbinse mo. Kung normal na tao, sabihin na lang na masustansiya
pero mahihirapan ka kasi mahal nga.”

("It depends on who you will convince. If the general public, just mention that brown rice is healthy
but it would be difficult to convince other people due to its price.)


‘Female/47 years old/Normal NS

“Ipaalam din na healthy ang brown rice at kung ano bang mga sustansiya ang makukuha nila

dun. Kasi yun yung binabayaran nilang mas mahal sa brown rice.”

(“Also inform the people that brown rice is healthy and what specific nutrients can it provide since

that's what they are paying for.’)

‘Female/47 years old/Normal NS
“Baguhin ang lifestyle, maging health conscious, magstart sa rice.”

(‘Change your lifestyle, be health conscious, start with rice.")

Female/39 years old/Normal NS
“Oo nga, sabihin na maganda sa kalusugan kahit di masarap.”

(Yes, mention that it is good for the health even though it is not tasty.")

‘Male/37 years old/Normal NS

“Pwedeng sabihin na masustansiya nga, pero mahirap mangumbinse kasi ako mismo di

kumakain 0 walang planong kumain nun.”

("It could be mentioned that it is healthy but it is hard to convince since | do not even eat or plan

to eat brown rice.")

‘Male/36 years old/Overweight NS
“Depende din sa kukuha yan eh, dapat itry muna nila.”

(cit depends on who to convince. they should try it first.”

People who can Incorporate Brown Rice in Daily Meals

Female/47 years old/Overweight NS
“Sa tingin ko yung may kaya lang, kaya nila kahit araw araw brown rice.”

((lthink those who are middle to upper class, they can eat brown rice every day.) _

Female/47 years old/Normal NS
“Pwede siguro ang mga pangkaraniwang tao kung bababaan ang presyo.

(‘Maybe normal people if the price is reduced.")

‘Male/36 years old/Overweight NS
“Yung mga nirekomendahan ng doctor na magbantay ng kinakain.”

(Those who are recommended by the doctor to watch their meals.")

Suggestions to Improve Brown Rice
‘Male/40 years old/Overweight NS
“Ang nakuha ko kanina sa usapan, dapat mas paigtingin yung information campaign baga sa

brown rice para mas malaman ng mga tao na masustansya siya at para dumami ang kumakain
nun.”

(‘What | gained from our discussion is that an information campaign on brown rice should be put
in place so that people will know that it is healthy so that they will try it.")
Female/63 years old/Normal NS
“Tsaka siyempre dapat ibaba yung presyo, kasi kahit alam nila na healthy kung wala namang
pambili, wala rin, di din makakakain ng brown rice palagi.”

(“Also, price should be reduced because even if they know that it is healthy, if they do not have
the capacity to buy it, then they will still not consume it regularty.")

Female/38 years old/Normal NS

“Pwede din patikimin yung mga tao ng brown rice, kasi nga gaya ng sabi kanina, di naman lahat
nakakatikim niyan kasi di lahat bumibili kasi nga mahal, pero kung malaman nila yung lasa. at
kung okay lang naman sa kanila na medyo matabang, baka mas maging katanggap tanggap
yung brown rice sa marami, sabay na din siguro ng pagbaba sa presyo.”

(‘Maybe people should also be given the chance to try brown rice since there are still many who
have not tasted it and do not plan to taste or try it due to its price. Maybe if they will know the
taste, it will be acceptable to them along with the reduction of its price.)

Female/73 years old/Normal NS
“Sabihin na bukod sa kulay niya, kanin din naman yung brown rice.”

(‘Mention that despite its color, itis still rice.")

Female/37 years old/Normal NS
“Babaan ang presyo at gawing available sa palengke, hindi lang sa supermarket.

(‘Reduce the price and make it more available in the local wet markets, not only in
supermarkets.)

Female/27 years old/Normal NS
“Babaan nga ang presyo al sanayin ang mga tao kumain, sana may proyekto yung gobyerno
para makita ng mga tao yung epekto niyan.”

(‘Reduce the price and make people used to eating it. The govemment should have projects
aimed at informing the people of the positive effects of brown rice.)

4-NC-NSE-05: Ganon rin po.
{lahat ay sumasang-ayon}

MOD: Sige po, so pag sinabi kong meal, ang pumapasok po sa isip natin at kanin at ulam. Ano naman po ang
‘mga bagay na isinasaalang-alang niyo po pag bibili ayo ng pagkain?

1-NC-NSE-01:

‘ung lasa po at presyo syempre.

1-NC-NSE-08: Sakin po, siyempre titingnan mo muna yung itsura, tapos dahil medyo gipit din sa pera, dapat yung
‘mura pero masarap.

1-NC-NSE-06: Dapat yung masustansiya din kasi may edad na,

MOD: May idadagdag pa po ba kayo? So tama naman po no, ang tinitingnan natin madalas yung presyo at lasa
Siyempre gusto natin masarap pero dapat mura rin po at siyempre masustansiya. Kanina, nabanggit na po natin
yung kanin, Pag sinabi po kayang kanin, anong pumapasok sa isip niyo?

4-NC-NSE-04: Puting kanin po.

4-NC-NSE-01: Opo, yun din po ang pumapasok sa isip ko

1-NC-NSE-06: Nakakabusog

MOD: Ano naman po ang opinyon niyo po sa brown rice?

1-NC-NSE-03: Nakatikim nako ng brown rice, okay naman kaso mahal yan sa palengke eh, tapos minsan wala ka
ang makita.

4-NC-NSE-01: Oo nga, yan yung tig-60 diba? Eh murang bigas lang binibili ko, pareho din naman
1-NC-NSE-04: Di ko pa nakita yan eh, kaya di ko rin masabi Kung masarap 0 hindi, kaso parang ang mahal
4-NC-NSE-05: Ako di ko pa natty pero pag marami na sigurong nagttry, baka maengganyo din ako,

MOD: Sige po, marami po ay di pa talaga kilala ang brown rice 0 di pa nakatikim ng brown rice. Sa tingin niyo po
ba, bakit kaunti lang ang nagttry ng brown rice?

1-NC-NSE-03: Yung presyo kasi mahal

4-NC-NSE-04: Di siguro alam nung iba gaya ko. Tsaka parang wala naman yatang pinagkaiba sa puti, mas mahal
fang

4-NC-NSE-02: Meron naman, ang alam ko nga pangpababa ng blood sugar yan.

MOD: Ayan, nabanggit narin natin ang tungkot sa epekto ng brown rice, tanungin ko po kayo, kung sasabihin ko
pong maraming pag-aaral ang nagpapakita na mas masustansiya ang brown rice kaysa sa puting kanin, sa tingin
niyo po ay papalitan niyo na yung puting kanin na kinakain niyo?

1-NC-NSE-04: Depende pag nagustuhan ko ang lasa

1-NC-NSE-06: Di siguro kasi mas mahal eh, di namin afford yan sa bahay.

4-NC-NSE-02: Oo nga di kaya ng budget

4-NC-NSE-01: Yoon tsaka di ko rin gusto yang brown pag sa ulam, parang matabang kasi

MOD: Sa tingin niyo po, yung mga nabanggit niyo po ang dahilan kung bakit di kumakain ang mga tao ng brown
rice, bale presyo at lasa po?

1-NC-NSE-04: Yun, tsaka siguro marami pa ang di nakatikim o nakakaalam ng brown rice.
MOD: Ok po. Sige, may mga komento pa po ba kayo sa brown rice?

1-NC-NSE-05: Kung magmumura lang, okay naman yung brown rice eh. Kaso nga mahal kaya kaonti ang bumibil

2-NC-NSE-09:

2-NC-NSE-1

MOD: Salamat po. Ngayon po. pag-usapan natin ang karaniwang “meal” o pagkain para sa inyo?

2:NC-NSE-04: Sa akin, pag sinabing “meat” ang naiisip ko ay prutas, chicken, gulay tapos with rice, yung complete
1a pagkain.

2:NC-NSE-08: Parang ganon din yung sakin, kanin, ulam, prutas. tinapay. at lagi kaming may gatas.
2:NC-NSE.07: Sakin din po ulam madalas ay tinola tapos prutas at gulay, palagi rin po kaming nagtiinapay.

2.NC-NSE-09:

\Ko rin po ay kame, minsan fish siyempre may kanin saka matatamis panghimagas.
2-NC-NSE-01: Kung ano yung laging kinakain pag agahan, tapos laging may prutas.

2.NC-NSE-05: Tama, laging may prutas, masarap na ulam kahit gulay, baboy, minsan ay may frozen foods tulad
1g hotdog at longganisa.

2-NC-NSE-03: Yun sa akin din po parehas din, gulay, kame at isda madalas
2-NC-NSE-02:

janon din po, gulay, isda, karne, chicken

2-NC-NSE-06: Madalas po manok ang ulam namin tapos kanin po.

MOD: Ano naman po ang mga isinasaalang-alang niyo sa pagpili ng kakainin?

2-NC-NSE-01: Ako base sa gutom lang, kung ano maisipang gusto, actually wala masyado po eh
2.NC-NSE.02: Siyempre po dapat masustansya

2-NC-NSE-06: Bukod sa healthy, dapat masarap din,

MOD: So sang-ayon naman po ang lahat na sarap at sustansiya ang isinasaalang-alang sa pagpili ng pagkian
Dako naman tayo sa kanin, kanina po, napag-usapan natin yung mga kadalasan niyong kinakain. Isa sa mga hindi
pwedeng mawala sa hapag ay ang kanin, Pag binanggit ko po ang salitang “kanin’, ano ang pumapasok sa isip
2-NC-NSE-03: Naiisip ko ay bigas.

2-NC-NSE-02: Sakin masarap.

2.NC-NSE-01: Oo nga, masarap tapos dagdag pa sa kalusugan ng katawan

2.NC-NSE-04: Sobrang kalusugan, pag naparami, nakakataba kasi mataas sa carbs

2-NC-NSE-0S: Pag sinasabing kanin, ang naiisip ko ay ulam.

2.NC-NSE-06 Nakakagutom naman ang usapan, yun ang naiisip ko pag Kanin, ibig sabihin nagugutom nako.
2.NC-NSE-07: Ang naiisip ko ay maputi at masarap.

2-NC-NSE-11: Ang kanin, masarap kahit kaunti o di masyado masarap ang ulam

MOD: Napag-uusapan na rin po natin ang kanin, ano po ang pangkaraniwan ninyong kinakain na klase ng kanin?
2-NC-NSE-02: White rice kasi ayaw po ng mga anak ko ng iba

2.NC-NSE-01: Put din po ang sa amin

2:NC-NSE-03: Lagi po kaming white rice, di pa po kami nakasubok ng iba

2.NC-NSE.07: White rice din naman po sa amin kasi yun yung mura.
2.NC-NSE-11:

fama po, mura kasi yun yung nakasanayan na
2-NC-NSE-04: Puti ri

. malasa kasi at malambot.

2:NC-NSE-08: Sa amin, commercial rice — kase hindi matigas pag malamig na
2-NC-NSE-05: Sa amin po ay Jasmine rice naman

2-NC-NSE.06: Kami rin po ay Jasmine

2-NC-NSE-0'

arehas din po, Jasmine rice kasi masarap di gaya ng NFA rice
2:NC-NSE-10: Kami din po ay white rice madalas ay dinorado,

MOD: Marami po sa atin ay white rice ang kinakain, pag-usapan naman po natin ang brown rice. Narinig niyo na
o ba ang brown rice? Ano po kaya ang masasabi niyo sa brown rice?

2-NC-NSE-1

): Ang alam ko sa brown rice ay masarap kaso di talaga namin nakasanayan
2:NC-NSE-03: Mukhang okay naman ang brown, mukhang masustansya naman.
2.NC-NSE.09: Parang masarap naman yung brown rice

2-NC-NSE-04: Sakin di naman masarap yun eh, matabang,

2:NC-NSE-02: Wala naman akong opinyon sa brown rice pero ang pagkakaalam ko ay madaling mapanis yun
tsaka hindi sult

2-NC-NSE-1

: Mahal pero mayaman naman sa vitamins.

2-NC-NSE-0

lasarap daw yun eh, gusto ng mayayaman.

2.NC-NSE-05: Mukhang maganda at masarap naman.

2.NC-NSE-07: Okay lang naman kaso medyo mahal at may kakaiba ang lasa,
2-NC-NSE-11: Masarap naman para sa akin pero matabang lalo pag may ulam

MOD: May kanya kanya po tayong opinyon sa brown rice ano, yung iba di pa pamilyar. Ngayon po, ang tanong
ko po ay, sa tingin niyo po, bakit pinipili ng mga tao ang white rice kumpara sa brown rice?

2-NC-NSE-06: Sa amin naman, willing naman kaming kumain ng brown rice kung mura ang presyo kaso mahal
talaga, di kaya sa budget namin

2-NC-NSE-05: Yung white rice mas mura kase tsaka mas madaling mahanap sa palengke.

2-NC-NSE-03: Oo nga, mahal kasi yang brown, pangmayaman lang tapos yung lasa di maintindihan, parang di
pwede sa ulam.

2-NC-NSE-09: Tama, mas mura yung white rice. Alam naman natin yun, praktikal na dapat tayo lalo mahirap ang
buhay, mahal ang mga bliin

2.NC-NSE-02: Sa amin, mas masarap talaga ang puti, mas mabango pa at mas mura

2.NC-NSE-04: Tsaka kasi nakasanayan na namin ang white rice, hirap na magpallt, baka di pa gusto ng pamilya
ko.

2.NC-NSE-07; Oo nga mas nakasanayan na kasi namin ang puting kanin tapos mas masarap pa kainin.

2.NC-NSE-10: Marami ang di pa nakakakilala sa brown rice, yung iba di pa nga nakakita nun. Tsaka kung
‘nakatikim na, di naman kaya ng budget.

2.NC-NSE-11: Kami rin nakasanayan na namin yung puti tsaka ang layo naman ng deperensya sa presyo.

192

MOD: Co nga po, mas mahal yung brown, pero bawi naman po sa sustansiya, Ngayon po, kung sasabihin ko sa
inyo na maraming pag-aaral na ang nagsabi na mas maraming benepisyo ang makukuha sa pagkain ng brown
rice, willing po ba kayong kumain na ng brown rice kaysa sa white rice?

2-NC-NSE-08: Pwede namang subukan pero hindi palagi, kasi nga mahal.

2-NC-NSE-02: Para sa mga matatanda pwede siguro pero sa tingin ko di magugustuhan ng mga bata kasi nga
matigas at matabang

2-NC-NSE.03: Pwede nga kung masustansiya naman, pero parang pang-matanda kasi yung brown rice parang
pang may sakit kasi.

2-NC-NSE-04: Sang-ayon naman ako kasi masustansiya, baka pwede namang masubukan.

2.NC-NSE-06: Kami hindi siguro kasi mahal nga tsaka mahirap hanapin sa palengke, bihira lang ako makakita
niyan eh.

2-NC-NSE-09:
‘Ag mga bilhin.

}onga, hindi kase mahal ang brown rice. Sa panahon ngayon di na dapat mag-inarte lalo sa mahal

‘MOD: Ayan, merong 00 at meron ding hindi willing magpalit ng klase ng kanin. Ngayon naman po, tanungin ko po
kayo kung bakit di kumakain ang mga tao ng brown rice madalas 0 ano kaya ang mga dahilan kung bakit di
kumakain ang mga tao ng brown rice?

2-NC-NSE-05: Ayun nga, gaya ng nabanggit kanina, mahal kase. Marami, di kaya ng budget yung 60 hanggang
80 pesos na kilo, kasi kung puti yung bibilhin, mas mura, yung labis ay maipapambili pa ng ulam

2-NC-NSE-06: Oo nga sobrang mahal kasi, kaya mga mayayaman lang ang makakabili o kaya yung may mga
sakit talaga na di na pwede sa puting kanin.

2-NC-NSE-07: Bukod sa mahal, matabang kasi yung brown rice. Parang pakiramdam mo di malasahan yung
ulam,

2:NC-NSE-02: Sang ayon ako diyan, matabang nga, siyempre yung pipilin mo yung mura tapos masarap at
‘mabango. Yung brown rice di masarap lalo kapag ulam mo ay may Sabaw, kaunti lang tuloy ang nakakain, tsaka
parang mabilis ako magutom pag brown rice ang kinakain ko.

2-NC-NSE-04: Siguro kasi din hindi aware yung mga tao na masustansiya pala yung brown rice kaya kaunti lang
yung sumusubok.

2.NC-NSE-08: Tama, marami nga di pa nakakita ng brown rice, ako nga di pa nakakatikim, Wala namang
commercial sa tv o sa radyo na nagsasabi na kumain ng brown rice at masustansiya ito. Sanay na kasi ang marami
ssa puting bigas at sanay na bulsa namin sa murang bigas.

MOD: Ayan, dito na po nagtatapos ang ating usapan. Maraming salamat po sa inyong kasagutan at gusto ko rin
pong magpasalamat sa pagdalo ninyo sa FGD na ito. Ingat po kayo.

MOD: Ngayon, pag-usapan po natin ang karaniwang pagkain sa inyo. Sa pang-araw araw, ano po kaya ang
kadalasan niyong kinakain?

3-NC-NSE-05: Sa akin po madalas ay gulay at isda paminsan po, pag may budget ay may kame. Siyempre kanin
Po, hindi mawawala sa hapag.

3-NC-NSE.09: Ako naman po, ganon din pero tagi pong may prutas gaya ng saging para malusog.

3-NC-NSE-01: Sang-ayon ako diyan, dapat laging may prutas. Sa akin, kahit ano naman — gulay, kame, isda —
kapareha ng kanin

3-NC-NSE-02: Mahilig ako sa manok, pero pag wala, isda at gulay lang din

3-NC-NSE.06: Pag sinasabing pagkain, ang pumapasok sa isip ko ay pananghalian - gulay, isda, karne, kanin,
kahit anong heavy pag almusal naman, pandesal

3-NC-NSE-08: Sakin din, di mawawala ang tinapay, lalo pag merienda
3-NC-NSE-03: Ako mahilig sa fries, burger, chicken na may rice
3-NC-NSE-04: Mahilig din ako sa junk food. Minsan kaya kong kumain ng junk food lang sa meryenda

MOD: Okay. marami po tayong mga kadalasang kinakain, ano naman po kaya ang mga isinasaalang-alang po
rninyo kapag pumipili o bumibili po kayo ng pagkain?

3-NC-NSE-08: Siyempre dahil sa may edad na rin ang iba kong kasama sa bahay, ang priority namin sa pag
ay yung mga healthy na pagkain. Di kami bumibili ng mga bawal dahil mataas na nga ang cholesterol at blood
sugar

3-NC-NSE-05: Sang-ayon ako diyan kasi yung mga magulang ko ay may edad na din kaya nga healthy ang binibil
namin, pero kung ako lang, okay lang kahit ano, basta mura

3-NC-NSE-08: Tama yan, dapal ay yung maraming vitamins na magugustuhan din ng bata.

3-NC-NSE-10: Tama yan, dapat masarap, yung magugustuhan ng mga anak ko na pasok sa budget. Mahirap din
kasi magpakain ng anak

3-NC-NSE-02: Dapat din po ay malinis.

MOD: Maraming salamat po sa mga sagot ninyo. Ang napansin ko po, marami ang nagsasaalang alang ng
sustansiya na pasok sa budget. Sige po, magpatuloy na po tayo. Kanina po ay nabanggit niyo na madalas pag
sinasabing “meal” ay may kame, may isda, o gulay pero dapat ay di mawawala ang kanin. Pag sinabi pong kanin,
‘ano po ang pumapasok sa isip niyo?

3-NC-NSE-04: Ako ang naiisip ko unli rice, kaya lagi sa bahay, maraming isinasaing kasi malakas kami magkanin,
3-NC-NSE-07: Ang naiisip ko ay kakain na, oras na ng tanghalian o hapunan, ganon po.

3:NC-NSE-02: Pag kanin, dapat ay maganda iluto, yung di matubig at mabilis ma-inin

3-NC-NSE-03: Gusto kong kanin yung mabango.

3-NC-NSE-10: Ay dapat yung masarap din.

3-NC-NSE-09: Oo, pag masarap yung kanin, maganda kapartner ng ulam.

3-NC-NSE-11: Tama, dapat malasa yung kanin para kahit anong ulam, okay lang

MOD: Ano po bang klase ng bigas ang binibili at kinakain ninyo at ng inyong pamilya at bakit?
3-NC-NSE-10: Sa amin commercial kasi mas malasa at madali isaing.

3-NC-NSE-02: Kami commercial din kasi yung mister ko ayaw ng iba, maarte kasi yun
3-NC-NSE-03: Kahit anong white rice na affordable kasi bibili pa ng ulam eh.

3-NC-NSE-04: Ganon din kami, yung mura lang na puti, madalas NFA.

3-NC-NSE-05: Put rin kasi yun na nakasanayan namin simula pagkabata pa

3-NC-NSE-06: Bukod sa nakasanayan, masarap kasi yung puti kahit anong ulam ang isama mo.

3-NC-NSE-08: Samin naman dapat mabango at malasa gaya ng Jasmine at Angelica, Pag kapos sa budget, okay
nna kahit yung mas mura

3-NC-NSE-09: Kami sinandomeng, o kaya basta mura,
3-NC-NSE-11:

Kahit anong white, yung madaling mahanap at bithin. Availabilty kumbaga.
3-NC-NSE-12: Kami rin puting kanin, yun kasi nakasanayan na eh

MOD: So karamihan po ay puro puti, siyempre kasi yun ang marami sa merkado, pero tanong ko po ay kung
akakita na po kayo ng brown rice at kung anong masasabi niyo sa brown rice?

3-NC-NSE-03: Nakakita nako nun pag bum

‘ng bigas, mahal yun tsaka parang sa supermarket lang meron
3-NC-NSE-08: Oo nga mahal pero maganda daw sa katawan.

3-NC-NSE-01: Ako di pa ko nakatikim niyan pero nakakita nako, Ang alam ko healthy yan kaya mahal.
3-NC-NSE-12: Sabi nga nila masustansya

3:NC-NSE-05: Oo nga masustansiya, pero pang may diabetes lang ata yan.

3-NC-NSE-09: Healthy nga kaso mahal tapos yung lasa di magustuhan kasi matabang pero mabigat naman sa
tiyan

3-NC-NSE-02: Sa akin maayos naman ang lasa, masarap.

‘MOD: Tama po kayo, masustansiya nga ang brown rice, pero sa tingin niyo po, bakit naman po di pinipili ng mga
tao yung brown rice?

3:NC-NSE-04: Mas mura kasi yung putt

3-NC-NSE-08: Tama, mas mura nga. Dalawang kilo na ng bigas namin mabibili sa isang kilong brown
3-NC-NSE-03: Pangunahin. yung presyo talaga, mahirap na kasi buhay ngayon kaya importante yun
3-NC-NSE-12: Tama, mahal na bigas yan, baka di na kami makabili ng ulam

3-NC-NSE-10: Bukod sa presyo, di kasi kilala ng mga tao yung brown. Yung iba nga di pa nakakita non.
3-NC-NSE-02: Nakasanayan na kasi yung puti, yun na yung gusto ng mga tao.

3-NC-NSE-07: Para sa akin, may lasa kasi yung puti yung brown pag sinama na sa ulam, matabang

3-NC-NSE-01: Oo nga, matabang na, matigas pa sabi nla
3-NC-NSE-1

i masarap tapos hirap pang hanapin, wala nga yata sa palengke yan eh.

MOD: Kung sasabihin ko po sa inyo na maraming pag-aaral na ang nagsabi na mas masustansiya ang brown rice
kaysa sa white rice, kakain na po ba kayo ng brown rice? Bakit o bakit hindi?

3-NC-NSE-1:

: Hindi dahil mataas ang presyo tapos mahirap hanapin.

3-NC-NSE-03: Ako naman yes, kung mas madami ang naibibigay na sustansya

3-NC-NSE-07: Sa pamilya siguro namin mahirap dahil matabang yang brown rice eh

MOD: Hati po ang desisyon kung kakain na ng brown rice kung mas masustansya, para po sa huling katanungan,
bakit po kaya di kinakain ang brown rice ng mga tao o ano kaya ang mga pangunahing hadiang sa pagkain ng
brown rice?

3-NC-NSE-04: Di kasi kilala ng mga tao.

3-NC-NSE-0:

: Marami din ay di gusto yung kulay at lasa.
3-NC-NSE-03: Di sulit yung presyo kasi di masarap.
3.NC-NSE-05: Mga Pilipino kasi sanay sa puting kanin, kaya kaunti lang ang bumibili ng brown.

3:NC-NSE-12: Bukod sa mataas ang presyo, kaunti ang tinda, eh kami pa naman di bumibili sa supermarket kasi
mahal,

MOD: Ayan, maraming maraming salamat po sa inyong mga kasagutan, Makakatulong po ito upang mas
mapaganda pa ang brown rice para sa hinaharap, mas marami nang kumain nito, Maraming salamat po uli!

4-NC-NSE-09: ******* po,

4-NC-NSE.0

4-NC-NSE-11: *™™* na lang po.

MOD: Ngayon po, simulan po natin ang ating usapan tungkol sa pagkain. Kapag po sinabing meal’, ano po kaya
‘ang pumapasok sa isip niyo?

4-NC-NSE-05: Ako na po ang magsimula, sa akin po, ang naiisip ko, siyempre, Pilipino tayo eh, siyempre kanin
atulam

MOD: Ok po, kayo po ba?
4-NC-NSE-08: Sakin kanin din tapos yung ulam iba iba, madalas kame, isda, gulay, mga ganyan

4-NC-NSE-09: Ako siyempre kanin, tapos gusto ko yung sinigang na baboy o hipon o kaya kahit anong may sabaw
‘gaya ng nilaga tapos minsan gusto ko rin ng inihaw, pag may handaan lang siguro.

4-NC-NSE-10:
isda at kanin.

jaya din po sa kanya, gusto ko din ng nilaga at sinigang, pero madalas kong kinakain ay gulay at

4-NC-NSE-01: Parehas din po sa kanila.
‘4-NC-NSE-02: Sa amin po ang palaging hinahain ay tortang talong, rice, tapos madalas din karne.

4-NC-NSE-11: Ako kasi ang gusto ko yung mga putok batok eh, bulalo - masarap yung marrow, karekareng baka.
tapos paborito ko rin yung spaghetti at pancit, pampahaba naman ng buhay. sabi nila

4-NC-NSE-03: Sa akin ang meal ay pasta 0 kaya carbonara tapos may fruit salad din tsaka kame gaya ng
barbecue, yung mga panghanda po. Kadalasan nagluluto din ako niyan sa bahay at nagugustuhan naman ng mga
anak ko. Pag lam naman, usually hotdog at itlog o kaya yung mga ibang pritong pagkain din.

4-NC-NSE.04: Kami din mahilig sa pasta, pero paminsan lang. Pag regular na araw, lalo pag wala pa kong pension
‘at wala pang sahod yung mga tao sa bahay, kanin at ulam lang, yung ulam namin madalas gulay kasi mura tsaka
masustansiya

4-NC-NSE-06: Oo nga, sa akin ang meal ay puro gulay lang halimbawa, malunggay. kangkong, 0 talbos. Madalas
binanlian lang tapos isasawsaw sa bagoong

‘4-NC-NSE-01: Ganon din po sa amin pero mahilig din po kami sa manok.

4-NC-NSE-12: Ako na lang po ba? Kami wala naman kaming pinipil, lahat pwede, baboy, manok, gulay. Kahit
ano po

‘MOD: Sige po, nalaman na natin kung ano ang meal sa inyo. Punta naman tayo sa mga isinaalang alang po ninyo
a pagpili nung mga nabanggit ninyong pagkain. Ano po kaya yung mga iyon?

‘4-NC-NSE-12: Kahit ano siguro, basta di kami magutom.

4-NC-NSE.08: Ako pag napapadaan sa palengke, kahit anong makita kong gusto ko na kasya yung kinita ko sa
isang araw. Ibig kong sabihin yung mura dapat kasi minsan iba iba din naman yung kita ko kaya dapat magtipid
din para may mahuhugot sa mga susunod na araw

4-NC-NSE-02: Sang ayon po ako kay nanay, pangunahing isinasaalang alang namin ay yung mura ang presyo
kasi marami namang mabibiling mura pero masarap pa din eh.

4-NC-NSE-10: Tama nga po, presyo.

4-NC-NSE-03: Sa akin, siguro dapat yung gusto ng mga bata. Kasi mahirap nga pakainin yung mga anak ko,
sobrang pihikan, kaya pag humiling ng hotdog, binibigay ko na lang kaysa naman mamatay sa gutom yung mga
yun diba.

4-NC-NSE-04: Ay sa amin di pwede yang mga prito prito kasi may maintenance na eh, di pwedeng magkasakit
kasi gamot pa lang mahal na kaya ang inuuna namin pinipili ay yung masustansya, di kami bumibiling mga bawal
na pagkain

4-NC-NSE-09: Tama yan, lagi kong pinapabili ay yung masustansiya kasi dapat mapangalagaan yung kalusugan
1g pamilya ko lalo na madalas malayo ako, mahirap na magkasakit.

4-NC-NSE-05: Sa akin sang-ayon naman ako sa mga sinabi nila pero siyempre di ko kinakalimutan na dapat
™malinis din yung pagkain lalo na pag lutong pagkain na yung bibithin, para di magkasakit yung pamilya ko. Eh kung
masustansiya at mura nga, madumi naman, edi magtatae din kayo. Kaya ayun, wag din natin kalimutan yung
kalinisan

MOD: Maraming salamat po sa mga sagot niyo. Ngayon po, napag-usapan natin kanina yung mga pagkaing
kadalasan ninyong kinakain, Siyempre dahil po Pilipino tayo, di po mawawala ang kanin. Ngayon po, tanungin ko
po kayo, pag nabanggit ko po ang kanin, ano pong naiisip niiyo?

4-NC-NSE-02: Pag binanggit ang kanin kailangan may ulam. Yun yung una kong naiisip.
4-NC-NSE-05: Ako kahit anong ulam basta unii rice.
4.NC-NSE-10: Siyempre yung kanin ay nakakabusog kaya nga dapat may kanin lagi eh.

4.NC-NSE-03: Sobrang nakakabusog kaya minsan nakakataas din ng blood sugar, tapos dahil napapasarap sa
ulam, tataas cholesterol mo,

4-NC-NSE-09: Kaya nga dapat habang tumatanda ay mag-aadjust diet, Kontian lang ang kain, dapat one cup lang,
iwas na sa unli rie.

4-NC-NSE-04: Oo kasi pag naparami ng kain ng kanin, tataba ka

4-NC-NSE-12: Pero di naman siguro tayo mabubuhay pag walang kanin diba. Maganda din naman siya sa
kalusugan, basta hinay hinay lang, Kasi pag di tayo kumain ng kanin, manghihina tayo. Parang di rin kumain yun.

4-NC-NSE.06: Tama naman yan, maganda sa pakiramdam pag nakakain ng kanin, lalo pag gutom na gutom,
kaya nga paminsan ay napapa-unil rice kasi minsan nagugutom ng husto.

‘MOD: Ayan, so marami po tayong naiisip pag napag-usapan ang kanin. Kayo po ba, anong kiaseng kanin ang
kinakain ninyo at ng pamilya niyo at bakit?

4.NC-NSE-11: Sa amin kahit ano basta puti, yung mura lang para makabili ng masarap na ulam.

4-NC-NSE-12: Samin din white rice, minsan kasi may nagbibigay sa amin na kamag-anak galing sa Cagayan kaya
yun yung kinakain namin

4-NC-NSE-07: Puti rin po, kasi yun lang ang madaling makita sa palengke eh. Yung brown rice 0 red rice o kahit
anong may kulay na bigas kung hindi mahal, wala naman sa palengke

4-NC-NSE-04: Kaya nga yung white rice kasi kahit saan, minsan kahit sa tindahan lang meron, diyan natatalo ng
white rice ang brown rice, di kasi laging available ang brown.

4.NC-NSE-08: Kami din po white rice kasi yun lang kaya naming bilhin, maliit lang budget sa pagkain kasi
aglalaan din kami ng pangpuhunan, pangbaon ng mga bala, at para sa iba pang gastusin sa bahay.

4-NC-NSE-10: White din po, yun lang ang kaya.
4-NC-NSE-02: Sa amin laon o kahit anong puting bigas na maalsa at dapat mura

4-NC-NSE-05: White din kasi yun na nakasanayan ng buong pamilya tsaka mas madaling isaing

200

4-NC-NSE-09: Puti, Kasi mas masarap i-ried rice tsaka gaya nga ng sabi ni kuya, yun na kasi ang nakasanayan
kaya mahirap nang palitan.

4-NC-NSE-03: Kami dinorado kasi malambot at makinis, yun kasi ang hinahanap ng pamilya namin sa kanin.

4-NC-NSE-06: Sa amin din puti kasi ayaw ng mga kasama ko ng brown rice alam mo namang bumili pa ako ng
hiwalay na bigas dahil lang masustansiya

MOD: Ngayon po napag-uusapan na rin natin yung brown rice, ano naman po ang masasabi ninyo sa brown rice?
4-NC-NSE-1

Nung natikman ko masarap naman at nakakabusog,

4-NC-NSE-03: Oo nga, okay lang plus nakakababa ng sugar sabi ng iba kaya nga may mga diabetes yan kinakain
eh

4-NC-NSE.04: Healthy nga ang brown

4-NC-NSE-06: Ang masasabi ko maganda naman ang brown rice, magaang sa pakiramdam, tsaka naaalis ang
mantika sa katawan.

‘4-NC-NSE-07: Kaso po mahal naman.

4-NC-NSE-10: Kaya nga, kahit masustansiya, kung mahal naman, mamumulubi ka sa pagbili nung brown rice,
Pero sa iba siguro pwede lalo na yung may mga kaya sa buhay at yung mga sobrang health conscious.

4-NC-NSE-02: Ang alam ko lang sa brown rice mahal ang kilo pero di ko pa nasubukan
4-NC-NSE-O'

\ko din di ko pa pa natry
4-NC-NSE-11: Ako din di ko pa po nasubukan.

MOD: Marami po ang nakakaalam na sa brown rice sa inyo, ngayon po, sa tingin niyo, bakit po pinipili ng mga tao
ang white rice kaysa sa brown rice?

4-NC-NSE.01:
dati, white rice di

i kasi Kilala yang brown rice, at kami, simula pagkabata white rice na talaga. Kahit yung mga tao
kaya wala masyadong pumipili ng brown rice.

4.NC-NSE-0:

‘ama, nakasanayan kasi.

4.NC-NSE-05: Oo nga, mas kilala ng mga tao yung puting kanin, saka sa palengke diba, yung puti lima o higit pa,
na klase, may mura may mahal, yung brown rice mahal lang tas wala ka pang pagpipilian. Wala kaming choices,

4-NC-NSE.03: Sanay na kasi kami sa masarap at malasang bigas. Yung masarap ipares sa mga ulam.

4-NC-NSE-06: Yan nga yung priority, lasa tsaka sang-ayon ako dun sa masarap ipares sa ulam lalo na yung mga
may sabaw.

‘4-NC-NSE-02: Kasi nga yung white rice mas mura, dati nga sobrang mura lang nun, eh nagmahal na wala ka
‘nang makikita na 30 pesos na bigas. Pano pa yung brown rice, sobrang mahal

4-NC-NSE-04: Bukod sa presyo, siyempre yung lasa din, lugi kami sa lasa, kaya isa ako dun sa hindi pumipili sa
brown rice kasi pang-mayaman lang.

4-NC-NSE-10: Oo nga, mas affordable kasi yung brown rice.

4-NC-NSE-12: Pag pumunta ka sa palengke, ang makikita mo lang sa lahat ng tindahan ng bigas, white rice. Kaya
aanong bibithin mo? Siyempre kung ano yung nandyan na, yung madaling makita kasi pangmatagalan, mahihirapan
din maghanap ng brown nice, sa supermarket lang ata nabibili yan

4-NC-NSE-07: Oo nga yung puti kasi bukod sa mura at madaling hanapin, mas nakakabusog kasi yun para sa
matatanda

nr
IS

MOD: Mukhang nagkakasundo naman po kayo na mahal yung brown rice at para sa iba, di masarap ang lasa.
Pero pag sinabi ko po ba sa inyo na maraming pag-aaral ang nagsasabing mabuti sa kalusugan ang brown rice,
sa tingin niyo po ba ay kakain na kayo ng brown rice? Bakit o bakit hindi?

4-NC-NSE-02: Pwede naman po pero hindi palagi kasi depende pa rin sa budget,
4-NC-NSE.03:

}0, kung negatibo naman pala yung white rice pwede naman magbrown rice na
4-NC-NSE-04: Oo siguro lalo na kung health conscious.
4-NC-NSE-05: Oo naman, kung masustansya talaga,

4-NC-NSE-06: Ako naman hindi, kung ako lang okay lang naman, pero di siguro matatanggap ng buong mag-
anak.

4-NC-NSE-07: Pwede naman kung mas maganda sa katawan. Tipirin na lang ang pagkain kasi mahal
4-NC-NSE-0B: Ako di pa sure kasi di ko pa natikman,

4-NC-NSE-03: Sakin din depende kung masusubukan ko at kung magugustuhan ko yung lasa.
4-NC-NSE-10: Samin din, 00, lalo't masustansiya kasi okay lang talaga kung pantay ang presyo bakit hindi
4-NC-NSE-11: Oo nga, kakain na, kasi sabi niyo nga po. maganda sa kalusugan.

4-NC-NSE-12: Yes, maganda, mabigat sa tiyan, at masarap kainin

MOD: Pero bakit po kaya di kinakain ng marami ang brown rice?

4.NC-NSE-09: Marami kasi di pa nakatry ng brown rice, tulad ko. Kasi di naman kami bibill lang, siguro pag may
agpatikim at nagustuhan, marami na ang kakain.

4-NC-NSE-03: Hindi kasi masarap, maaligasgas sa bibig tsaka di nga malasa

4-NC-NSE-04: Tama yan, di kasi kami sanay sa lasa tapos kulang pa sa awareness dun sa kahalagahan sa
kalusugan ng brown rice at siyempre importante sa lahat yung affordability,

4-NC-NSE-05: Hirap kasi wala sa market.
4-NC-NSE-08: Tsaka mahal
4-NC-NSE-10: Oo nga, mahal
4-NC-NSE-11: Sa presyo talaga

‘MOD: Salamat po sa mga sagot ninyo, magaganda po yung mga napag-usapan natin. Sana po ay makatulong ito
sa pagdevelop pa ang brown rice para rin po magustuhan ninyo.

‘apag po sinasabing brown rice, anong naiisip ninyo?.
5-SC-NSE-02: Paano po yung hindi pa nakakatikin ng brown rice, bihira kasi yun eh tapos mahal daw

MOD: Kahit po hindi pa kayo nakatikim, kung nababalitaan niyo naman po, okay lang, kung wala po talaga kayong
ideya, maaari pong hindi na kayo sumagot. Ayun, may iba pa po bang katanungan. Kung wala na po, maaan na
tayong sumagot, ultin ko nalang po ang tanong, ano po ang ideya niyo sa brown rice, ano yung naiisip niyo kapag
sinabing brown rice?

5-SC-NSE-01: Bihira ko lang makita yan eh, sabi nila pang nagdidiyeta o kaya sa mga may diabetis, Mas
akakabusog din daw.

5-SC-NSE-03: Maganda sa katawan kaso mahal daw eh.

5-SC-NSE-02:

i Ko pa nasubukan yun eh,

5-SC-NSE.04: Natikman ko na yun, masarap naman.

5-SC-NSE-06: Yun din, masustansya kasi

5-SC-NSE-05: Oo nga, masustansya raw.

5-SC-NSE-07: Nakakita na ang mister ko niyan sa Quiapo at gusto nga naming bumil
5-SC-NSE-08:

fatabang yun eh,
5-SC-NSE-09: Hindi ko type yun

MOD: Ayun, yung nga po yung mga common na ideya sa brown tice ano, naghahalo-halo ang positibo at
‘negatibong pananaw, nandiyan yung sa lasa na matabang, mahal pero may magandang epekto sa kalusugan

‘MOD: Kayo po ay kumakain halos lahat ng puting kanin ano. Sa tingin niyo po, bakit kaya mas pinipili ng mga tao
a bun at kumain ng whe rice kumpara sa brown oe? Kayo po, bakit kayo mas pripfing kumain ng puing
5-SC-NSE.05: Kasi mas mura nga yung put.

5-SC-NSE-02: Nakasanayan na kasi yung puti din dito sa Pilipinas, yung kasi yung madalas na makita
5-SC-NSE-07: Kasi hindi nga madaling mahanap ang brown rice.

5-SC-NSE-08: Yun din, dirin nakasanayan yung puti

5-SC-NSE-03: Mahal kasi ang brown rice eh, mas mura ang putt

5-SC-NSE-04: Oo nga, pang-mayaman kasi yun eh, mahal kasi ang brown rice.

5-SC-NSE.06: Para sa akin kasi mas mura nga, mas madali pang bithin,

5-SC-NSE-09: Mas masarap kasi yung puting kanin kahit na anong mangyari diba.

‘MOD: Opo nga, sa inyo po ba wala kayong nabibiling brownrice? Panay puti lang?

5-SC-NSE-01: Yung brown rice sa amin sa may mall lang nakikita, sa Savemore ganun, pero sa palengke, kaunt!
tang

5-SC-NSE-08: Ako nabigyan na dati pero mahal talaga eh. di kaya ng budget ng pamilya

MOD: O sige po, so ayun po yung napapansin natin sa brown rice ano, yung downside yung mahal, mahirap
hanapin, sa iba di gusto ang lasa, pero kung malalaman niyo pong may mga pag-aaral tungkol sa brown rice na
may magandang epekto sa katawan ito, gugustuhin niyo bang bumilinito para sa pang-araw-araw? Bakit o bakit
hindi sa tingin niyo?

5-SC-NSE-01: Basta ba mura

5-SC-NSE-05: Oo naman, masustansya eh.

5-SC-NSE-04: Hindi pa rin siguro, mahal kasi eh, pag bumaba okay yan
5-SC-NSE-08: Hindi pa rin, kasi nakasanayan na yung puti eh
5-SC-NSE-02: Okay lang, sakto lang

5-SC-NSE-03: Oo ba, basta bababa ang presyo.

5-SC-NSE-06: Hindi pang-araw-araw. pwede i-mix sa puti
5-SC-NSE-07: Kung ano ang kaya ng budget

5-SC-NSE-09: Hindi, sanay na kami sa put eh.

MOD: Okay, last two questions nalang po, malapit na po, sa tingin niyo po, bakit di madalas kainin ng mga tao
‘ang brown rice?

5-SC-NSE-09: Hindi kasi sikat yun eh, yung iba nga di pa rin naririnig yun, di pa nakakakita ng ganun.
5-SC-NSE-02: Kasi nga di nakasanayan

5-SC-NSE-03: Mahal kasi eh tiyaka di naman pamilyar yung mga tao diyan.

§-SC-NSE-06: Hindi kasi pamilyar ang mga tao diyan.

5-SC-NSE-07:

lindi kasi nakikita sa palengke yan.
5-SC-NSE-04: Yun nga, mahal eh, pang-mayaman
5-SC-NSE-08: Mahal siya eh, tapos ayun nga, di nakasanayan.

MOD: Ayun po kung kanina po ay dahilan ng di “madalas” na pagkain, bakit naman po sa tingin niyo di halos
kumakain ng brown rice ang mga tao 0 ano po kaya ang mga hadlang sa pagkain ng brown rice?

5-SC-NSE-02: Mahal nga kasi

5-SC-NSE-09: Bihira nga kasing marinig yun eh

5-SC-NSE-04: Mahal na tapos mas masarap pa ang white rice.
5-SC-NSE-07: Wala sa palengke kasi yan.

5-SC-NSE-06: Dahil dun, di pamilyar mga tao diyan.

5-SC-NSE-08: Presyo nga at di nga kasi nakasanayan ng mga tao yan

Naririnig niyo tungkol sa brown rice?

T-NC-NSE-09:

‘ung brown rice pang diet daw yan eh, sabi nila.
7-NC-NSE.04: Oo nga, mahal pero maganda nga sa katawan yang brown rice sa pagkakaalam ko

7-NC-NSE.06: Para sa akin, mahirap kainin yun eh, tapos ayaw pa nga ng mga bata, Tsaka mas mura kasi yung
white rice kaysa dun sa brown rice na sinasabi.

7-NC-NSE-02: Para sa akin, masarap din naman yang brown rice.
7-NC-NSE-05: Masustansiya nga yan, kaso mahal eh, parang singkuwenta mahigit yata.
7-NC-NSE-08: Masarap naman, masustansya din, kulay lang ang naiba

MOD: Dahil po hindi tayo kumakain ng brown rice, sa tingin niyo po, bakit kaya mas puting bigas ang binibili ng
‘mga tao? Kayo po, bakit puti ang binibili niyo?

7-NC-NSE-02: Mahal nga kasi yung brown kung ikukumpara sa white rice.
7-NC-NSE-01: Tsaka mas masarap kasi yun eh
T-NC-NSE-03:

Di pati nakasanayang bilhin yung brown, aging puti ang binibil
7-NC-NSE-08: Ako nga bihira ko makita kasi yan sa palengke.
MOD: Ayan, nakita po natin sa mga sagot niyo kung bakit hindi masyadong tinatangkilik ang brown rice ano po,

Kung sakaling malalaman natin na mas masustansya at mas mas maganda sa katawan ang pagkain ng brown
rice, magbabago ba ng isip niyo sa pagbill nito kapalit ng white rice?

7-NC-NSE-02: Oo sana kaso mahirap sa mga anak ko kasi matabang
7-NC-NSE-06: Ganun din, hindi pa rin, ayaw ng mga bata eh
7-NC-NSE-01: Ako hindi, hindi kasi masarap di gaya ng put.
7-NC-NSE-03: Kung gaganda yung kalusugan, yun na bibilhin namin

MOD: Huling mga tanong nalang po, matatapos na tayo. Bakit po kaya hindi madalas na kinakain ng mga tao ang
brown rice?

7-NC-NSE-01: Hindi kasi masarap.

7-NC-NSE.02: Saka mas mahal kasi yung brown.

7-NC-NSE-03: At di sanay yung mga tao diyan, bihirang bihira kasi sa palengke.

MOD: Ngayon po, pag-uusapan po natin yung mga sinagutan niyo kanina. Para po sa inyo, ano ang matatawag
‘na “meal 0 ano ba yung mga pagkaing kadalasan ninyong kinakain?

1-NC-SE-09: Sa pamilya namin, pag sinabing meal, di naman laging kanin at ulam, pwede din ang oatmeal, tapos
Paborito namin ang mami kapareha ng mainit na tinapay.

1-NC-SE-04: Ay kami di pwedeng tinapay lang, di kami mabubusog, dapat may kanin tapos madalas ang ulam
namin ay manok, kada kain namin, may juice para masarap ang kain

4-NC-SE-02: Kami din kanin ang meal pero kaibahan lang sa sinabi ni tatay, baboy ang kadalasan naming lam

1-NC-SE.01: Sa amin kahit anong lutong bahay, tinola, kare-kare, adobo, basta kahit anong masarap na lutuin ng
wife ko, Tsaka mahilig din ako sa matatamis, para panghimagas.

1-NC-SE-03: Kami rin po kahit anong ulam, minsan gulay, isda, o kame, nakadepende din kasi sa budget yan.
Pero di mawawala ang kanin samin, di din namin kaya yung tinapay lang,

4-NC-SE-10: Ganon din po.
1-NC-SE-05: Ako po Ma‘am, ako po mahilig sa sinigang na baboy at adobo, masarap pareho sa kanin.

1-NC-SE-06: Kami parte na rin ng buhay namin ang kanin, kahit anong ulam pa, kahit di masyado masarap, basta
may kanin okay na. Yung tinapay naman pangmeryenda namin o kaya pandesal pag almusal

4-NC-SE-08: Sa amin ang paborito ay tinolang manok, tsaka gaya rin po sa inyo pang-snacks lang po yung
tinapay. Lagi din kaming may prutas at gulay para malusog ang katawan.

1-NC-SE-07: Sa bahay di pwedeng ok lang yung ulam, dapat masarap. kadalasan naggugulay kami pero may
baboy din, para sa mga bata, ang laging kinakain niyan ay mga processed foods, hotdog, longganisa, mga ganyan.
Saka mahilg din kami sa prutas pero madalas saging lang ang nabibil

MOD: Halos pare pareho yung mga kinakain natin, pero sa pagbili po ng pagkain, ano po ba ang mga isinasaalang
alang ninyo?

4-NC-SE-03: Kami madalas naming isinasaalang alang kung masustansiya, pero siyempre dapal kaya din ng
budget. Kaya madalas gulay ang kinakain namin kasi yun yung mura at masustansiya

4-NC-SE-01: Tama nga po, dapat masustansiya.

1-NC-SE-08: Sang ayon po kami diyan, di lang sa masustansiya, dapat di bibili mga bawal, sustansya, was was
dapat sa mga masakit sa puso, yung putok batok kumbaga.

4-NC-SE-02: Siyempre dapat tinitingnan din kung bago o fresh pa yung pagkain para di manakit ang sikmura
Pipilin mo din kung mukhang bago pa yung bibilhin mong gulay at kung hindi double dead yung kame

1.NC-SE-04: Sa amin naman, yung lasa ang priority. Kasi di ka naman mabubusog kung kaunti lang makakain
mo kasi di masarap yung pagkain.

1-NC-SE-05: Tama po yan, dapat masasarap yung pagkain, dapat yung gusto ng anak ko.
4-NC-SE.09: Kami isinasaalang alang namin yung gutom, bukod dun, wala masyado,

MOD: Salamat po sa magandang usapan natin, Ngayon naman po, ano naman po ang nai
nababanggit ang salitang *kanin"?

ip ninyo kapag

1-NC-SE-06: Ang naiisip ko ay bigas, kasi dun naman galing yung kanin, kaya bigas agad ang pumasok sa isip
ko.

219

1-NC-SE-09: Nakakagutom yung kanin, parang pag sinabing kanin, kakain na, o kaya maghahain na kasi gutom
na,

4-NC-SE-03: Ako baliktad naman, ang naiisip ko sa kanin ay nakakabusog. Kapag kumain ka at walang kanin, di
ka rin mabubusog

4-NC-SE-08: Kanin, maputi at masarap.

1-NC-SE.01: Masarap kasama ng ulam,

1-NC-SE.02: Oo nga, yun yung naiisip namin, masarap na ulam para ipareha sa kanin,
4-NC-SE-07: Yung kanin, di pwedeng walang kasamang ulam.

4-NC-SE-10: Sang ayon ako diyan, dapat yung pinipling bigas yung masarap para yung ulam kahit di masyado
masarap. okay parin, busog pa rin.

MOD: Ano naman pong klase ng kanin ang kinakain ninyo?
4-NC-SE-03: Kami kahit anong puti, kasi masarap isama sa ulam.
4-NC-SE-04: Kami din po white rice.

1-NC-SE-05: Co, white rice kasi mas mura at affordable. Mas kaya ng budget,
4-NC-SE-06: White rice din po.

4-NC-SE-09: Kami din po white rice — dinorado.

1-NC-SE-01: Samin Jasmine kasi mabango at mas masarap, kaunti lang naman deperensya sa ibang klase ng
bigas.

1-NC-SE-02: Kami naman dinorado, yun kasi nakasanayan namin
4-NC-SE-08: Sa bahay commercial rice talaga. Kasi mura at masarap.
1-NC-SE-10: Puti din po.

4-NC-SE-07: Kami white kasi ayaw ng mga bata ang ibang may kulay na bigas.
mop:

ladalas po talaga white rice ang kinakain. Ngayon po, ano naman ang masasabi ninyo sa brown rice?

4-NC-SE-02: Okay naman siya nung tinikman namin kanina pero ang pagkakaalam ko diyan mahal siya kaya nga
di kami bumibili eh,

4-NC-SE-01: Para sa akin matabang tapos mahal ang per kilo. Parang di nga sulit sa presyo.
1-NC-SE-06: Kahit naman siguro mahal, masustansiya naman.

1-NC-SE-07: Para sa akin mukhang maganda naman at masarap yung brown rice nung kinain ako.
1-NC-SE-03: Di ko nagustuhan, tsaka parang mahal nga.

1-NC-SE-08: Sa akin okay lang medyo mahal lang pero okay naman ang lasa

4-NC-SE-10: Ayos naman lasa kaso madaling mapanis yan sabi ng biyenan ko,

1-NC-SE-04: Ako sang-ayon ako sa kanya, matabang na, mahal pa

1-NC-SE-D5: Masarap naman.

1-NC-SE-09: Masarap nga pero medyo matabang tsaka di ko matantiya kung okay ipartner sa ulam.

MOD: So iba-iba po tayo ng pananaw sa brown rice, may maganda, may hindi, Bakit po kaya pinipili ng mga tao
‘ang white kaysa brown rice?


1-NC-SE-08: Isa lang yan, mas mura kase yung puti kaysa sa brown. Parang pang mayaman kasi yung brown
fice

1-NC-SE-06; Tama yan, sa presyo at lasa nagkakatalo,
4-NC-SE-09: Oo nga, dun kami siyempre sa mas mura kasi dapat praktikal na

1-NC-SE-01: Samin wala naman kaso yung mahal yung brown rice kung masustansiya naman, kaso mas masarap
talaga yung put

1-NC-SE-02: Kami rin mas sanay kami sa puting kanin. Simula yata pagkapanganak sakin yun na kinakain namin
kaya mahirap magbago.

1-NC-SE-03: Nakasanayan nga kasi yung white rice. Kung ako naman ang tatanungin, willing naman ako
‘magbrown rice pero sa tingin ko di naman magugustuhan ng pamilya ko yan

4-NC-SE-10; Madami nga din kasi di pa kilala yang brown rice. Di naman laging meron yan sa paiengke eh sa
palengke bumibili maraming tao.

MOD: Marami nga po ang may ayaw ng brown rice, pero kung Sabihin ko po sa inyo na maraming pag-aaral ang
nagsasabing maraming magandang maidudulot sa kalusugan ang brown rice, magiging willing po kaya kayong
kumain nito para sa inyo at para sa pamilya ninyo? Bakit po o bakit hindi?

1-NC-SE-01: Pwede naman basta pasok sa budget kung masustansiya naman

4-NC-SE-02: Oo nga po, pwede naman, willing naman kami kumain ng brown rice kaso nga sa hirap ng buhay
ngayon, di pasok sa budget yung presyo. Sa isang kilo ng brown dalawang kilo na ng puti ang mabibili ko, hindi
ta praktikal, pero kung gusto lang, gusto naman namin, sino ba ang ayaw ng masustansiya’ Pero kung di praktkal,
marami namang ibang masusustansiyang pagkain na hindi mahal, tulad ng gulay. Yun pwede mong itanim, libre
na, kaysa gagastos ka sa mahal na bigas tapos wala ka nang pambili ng ulam.

1-NC-SE-03: Oo nga, pwede naman talaga eh, basta kaya namin bilhin o kaya kung may magrarasyon.

1-NC-SE-04: Sakin naman, okay lang basta magustuhan din ng ibang tao sa bahay, kasi nakakapagod naman
kung hiwalay pa yung saing ko, eh kung kami magsaing maramihan talaga kasi malaking pamilya kami eh.

4-NC-SE.05: Okay lang naman, bakit hindi, kung masustansiya naman talaga
4-NC-SE-06: Okay lang din po, dahil masustansiya po,
4-NC-SE-07: Pwede din po kung may makukuha kaming sustansiya

4-NC-SE.08: Mga matatanda siguro pwede pero yung mga bata hindi. Ngayon pa nga lang na puti yung kanin
mahirap na magpakain pano pa kung brown

1-NC-SE-09: Pwede namang subukan tapos kung magustuhan ng pamilya, pwede nang ituloy tuloy.
4-NC-SE-10: Oo naman kung healthy.

MOD: Marami po okay lang, pero meron ding hindi, ngayon, sa tingin niyo po, bakit po kaya hindi madatas pinipli
‘okinakain ng mga tao sa pang araw araw ang brown rice o ano po kaya ang mga sdahilan kung bakit dito madalas
nna kinakain?

1-NC-SE-07: Di kasi siya kilala eh

1-NC-SE-03: Di rin siguro sanay ang mga tao sa pagkain ng brown at siyempre, di rin sanay sa presyo
1-NC-SE-09: Oo nga, sanay na mga tao sa puting bigas. mura lang kasi at masarap.

4-NC-SE-01: Mahal kase.

4-NC-SE-02: Oo nga mahal

4-NC-SE-04: Yan lang naman dahilan eh, dahil sa presyo at sa lasa din, di sanay mga tao sa lasa. Mahirap
‘introduce ang bago kung mayroon ka nang matagal nang nakasanayan.

MOD: Majority po sa atin, sa presyo ang dahilan at sa pagkakasanay sa white rice. Ngayon pong natikman niyo
‘na po ang brown rice, sa tingin niyo po masasama niyo na po sa pang-araw araw ang pagkain ng brown rice?

1-NC-SE-10: Kung sakin pwede, ayos lang naman kasi nga mataas ang blood sugar at cholesterol ko, di ko lang
alam sa mga kasama ko sa bahay

1-NC-SE-09: Hindi ko pa po masabi ngayon kasi hindi ko pa naconsider yung budget namin sa bahay, tsaka di rin
‘ako sigurado kung okay lang sa pamilya ko.

1-NC-SE-07: Ako hindi siguro, unless magustuhan ng pamilya ko yung lasa.
1-NC-SE-01: Oo, pwede, basta masustansiya at kaya ng budget namin.

1-NC-SE-08: Pwede naman mag-adjust kung maibabudget namin ng maayos. Pero di siguro palagi, kasi sobrang
mahal pag araw-araw

1-NC-SE-02: Samin pwede pag may budget. Paminsan siguro.

1-NC-SE-03: Sa amin baka pwede rin, pero pag kinapos sa budget, hindi muna sigur. Pwede siguro samin pero
paminsan minsan lang din.

4-NC-SE-05: Pwede nga naman kung binira lang
4-NC-SE-06: Kami pwede, kung healthy naman talaga

mop:
sila?

(ung kukumbinsinhin niyo kaya ang ibang tao na kumain ng brown rice, paano niyo kaya kukumbinsihin

1-NC-SE-01: Sasabihin ko siguro na good for the heart yung brown rice.

4-NC-SE-02: Pwede din banggitin na mas masustansiya ang brown rice kaysa sa puting bigas kahit medyo mas
mahal

4-NC-SE-09: Tama, sabihin lang na mas maraming sustansiya yung brown.
4-NC-SE-05: Mas maraming nakukuhang sustansiya sa brown rice at masarap din naman

4-NC-SE-03: Ako di ko pa sigurado kung ano sasabihin ko. Titingnan ko siguro pag nasearch ko na sa Google
kung ano pa pwedeng sabihin tungkol sa brown rice.

4-NC-SE-08: Ako di ko rin siguro alam, di kasi masarap para sa akin parang matabang kasi

4-NC-SE-10: Pwedeng sabihin na masustansiya lalo na sa mga may sakit, gaya ng diabetes at mataas na presyon
MOD: Sa tingin niyo po sino ang mga pwedeng magsama ng brown rice sa pang-araw araw na pagkain?
1-NC-SE-02: Yung mga nakakaangat sa buhay,

1-NC-SE-08: Pwede rin yung mga health conscious.

4-NC-SE-03: Tsaka yung mga may sakit at may budget.

4-NC-SE-10: Tama, yung mga mayayaman siguro,

1-NC-SE-06: Pati yung mga may diabetes kasi sila naman talaga may kailangan nun eh

4-NC-SE-01: Para sa akin yung mga health conscious talaga

MOD: Ano po kaya ang suhestiyon ninyo para mas maging katanggap tanggap yung brown rice?

4-NC-SE-01: Ang nakuha ko kanina sa usapan, dapat mas paigtingin yung information campaign baga sa brown

rice para mas malaman ng mga tao na masustansya siya at para dumami ang kumakain nun.

22:

4-NC-SE-02: Tsaka siyempre dapat ibaba yung presyo, kasi kahit alam nila na healthy kung wala namang pambil
wala rin, di din makakakain ng brown rice palagi

4-NC-SE-03: Pwede din patikimin yung mga tao ng brown rice, kasi nga gaya ng sabi Kanina, di naman lahat
nakakatikim niyan kasi di lahat bumibili kasi nga mahal, pero kung malaman nila yung lasa, at kung okay lang
naman sa kanila na medyo matabang, baka mas maging katanggap tanggap yung brown rice sa marami, sabay
ra din siguro ng pagbaba sa presyo.

‘MOD: Ayan, diyan po nagtatapos ang ating usapan. Naging makabuluhan po ang pag-uusap natin tungkol sa
pagkain at bigas. Maraming salamat po sa inyong kasagutan at sa pagsali sa FGD na ito.

at isda atsaka kanin,

2-NC-SE-08: Parehas din sa akin, gulay, isda, paminsan may kame o kaya chicken

2-NC-SE-02: Kami din po yung lasa ang inuuna, Lalo na yung mister ko, pihikan sa pagkain kaya gusto niya talaga
‘masarap na ulam pares sa kanin

2-NC-SE-06: Sa amin naman bukod sa lasa at presyo, dapat masustansya din. Lalo bawal magkasakit kaya pinipili
namin yung masusustansiyang pagkain.

2-NC-SE-08: Kinokonsidera din namin yung mga bawal na pagkain kina mama na pwede din sa mga bata. Kasi
mahirap pag magkaiba pa yung ulam, dapat isang lutuan na lang. Dapat yung pwede sa may diabetes at
hypertension

2.NC-SE-03: Sa amin talaga, kahit anong sabihin ng iba, presyo talaga ang mahalaga, Kasi dun nakadepende
kung may mapapanggastos pa sa ibang bagay tulad ng school. pamasahe, at iba pa

2.NC-SE-07: Kami din po presyo talaga.

MOD: Ayan, marami tayong kinokonsidera sa pagpili ng kinakain. Sa usapan natin na yon at yung kanina,
‘nabanggit natin ang kanin, Ano naman po ang pumapasok sa isip niyo pag binabanggit ang “kanin"?

2.NC-SE-01: Ang naiisip ko ay bigas, sinasaing pata maging kanin.

2-NC-SE-02: Sakin naman po ang naisip ko pag kanin ay kapares sa ulam. Di pwedeng kanin lang, dapat laging
may ulam

2-NC-SE-03: Ako kasi nagugutom ako pag nanirinig ko yung kanin eh
2.NC-SE-04:

Para sa akin, pareho din sa kanya, ulam, dapat masarap na ulam.
2:NC-SE-07: Samin kahit di masyado masarap ulam, kahit tuyo lang, okay na basta masarap ang kanin
2:NC-SE-05: Nakakabusog po yung kanin

2.NC-SE-06: Tama yan, tsaka yan ang di talaga pwedeng mawala sa pananghalian kasi kung hindi, magugutom
ka

225

2-NC-SE-08: Naiisip ko po ay masarap kainin yung kanin.

2.NC-SE-09: Di lang masarap, mabigat din sa tiyan kaya di ka agad magugutom pag kanin kinain mo.
MOD: Ngayon naman po, tatanungin ko naman po kayo kung anong klase ng kanin ang kinakain ninyo?
2.NC-SE-09: Samin po kahit anong puti, dinorado, sinandomeng, lagi NFA kasi yun lang pasok sa budget.
2-NC-SE-01: Kami din ganon ang.

2-NC-SE-08: Pati din samin puti din kasi yun nakasanayan ng mga bata.

2-NC-SE-04: Kami po sinandomeng, halos parehas nung pinatikim kanina.

2:NC-SE-02: Ang binibili namin puti kasi yun yung malasa.

2.NC-SE-03: Samin naman Jasmine rice, kasi mabango at mabuhaghag, yun yung matagal na naming nabibil
2:NC-SE-07: Samin basta puti, NFA pwede na, basta mura lang para may pambili pa ng masarap na ulam.
2.NC-SE-05: Kami dinorado.

2-NC-SE-06: Samin kahit ano, di naman kami pihikan, basta kasya sa sahod.

MOD: Ano naman po ang tingin 0 opinyon ninyo sa brown rice?

2.NC-SE-09: Kanina nung kumain kami ng brown rice, parang magaspang sa bibig tapos yung dalawa sa tatlo
parang di ko gusto yung amoy. Sa asa naman, di ko rin masyadong gusto. Mas okay pa rin yung kulay put

2.NC-SE-01: Okay sakin yung isang klase kanina, parang masarap, di ko lang alam kung masarap pag sinamahan
ng ulam, para kasing kakanin. Pero ang pagkakaalam ko mahirap lutuin, pero okay lang naman kasi naiiwan
naman ako sa bahay, kaya naman lutuin,

2-NC-SE-03: Yung mga amo ko kumakain ng brown rice, minsan pinapatikim nila ako. Okay naman yung lasa,
maganda pati yung itsura. Mas masarap yung pinatikim kanina kaysa dun sa nakain ko na dati, Mas masarap

2-NC-SE-04: Masarap naman po kaso di ata maganda isama sa ulam na may sabaw. Baka mawalan ng lasa yung
ulam

2-NC-SE-07: Sakin okay naman

2.NC-SE-05: Oo nga, masarap naman at masustansya

2-NC-SE-02: Masarap naman nga lalo yung isa, tsaka alam ko masustansiya pa.
2.NC-SE.06: Okay lang medyo mahal at di pangkarantwan ang lasa.

2.NC-SE-08; Masustansiya siya, pero marami siguro ang di masasarapan sa lasa_ Kasi pag tayo diba iaging may
Ulam, eh parang di naman magandang bagayan ng ulam yung brown rice kasi matabang

MOD: Ganon po ba, bakit po kaya pinipili ng mga tao ang white rice kaysa sa brown rice?
2:NC-SE-02: Mas mura po kase yung mga puting kanin saka mas maraming mapagpipilian.
2-NC-SE-04: Pangunahin nga sa presyo tsaka sa lasa din siguro.

2.NC-SE-01: Mas masarap ipares yung puti sa ulam at mas sult pa.

2.NC-SE-06: Di kase sanay mga tao kumain ng brown, ngayon naman nauuso pero sobrang mahal, parang mga
mayaman lang kaya makabil

2.NC-SE.09: Sang ayon po ako, mas masarap kainin ang puti at yun na yung nakasanayan ng mga tao.

2-NC-SE.05: Mas affordable talaga yung white rice bukod sa nakasanayan na. Saka alam ko naman walang
kokontra, pero mahirap na ang buhay ngayon diba? Kailangan nang maging praktikal

226

2.NC-SE-08: Samin naman po, puti kasi talaga gusto sa bahay, di pa kami nakatikim ng brown rice kasi di naman
kami bumibili nun. Ako pa nga lang ata nakatikim ngayon,

MOD: So sa presyo at lasa po talaga kaya di pinipili ng mga tao ang brown rice. Ngayon po, kung sasabihin ko po
sa inyo na maraming pag-aaral ang nagsasabing maganda sa kalusugan ang brown rice, kakain na po ba kayo
nito 0 hindi pa rin po? Bakit o bakit hindi po kaya?

2-NC-SE-01: Hindi kami, dahil sa mahal na presyo.

2-NC-SE-02: Pwede naman po basta nakakabuti sa katawan.

2:NC-SE-03: Samin pwede subukan muna, mahal kase eh.

2-NC-SE-04: Hindi din po samin kase mahal ang brown rice.

2-NC-SE-05: Pwede naman kasi healthy naman talaga,

2-NC-SE-06: Titingnan ko pa kung magustuhan din ng pamilya ko.

2-NC-SE.07: Ako din ganon, tingnan ko muna kung gusto rin ng pamilya ko,

2-NC-SE-08: Subukan na lang namin. Pag nagkabudget na

MOD: Ano po sa tingin niyo yung mga dahilan kung bakit di madalas kinakain ng mga tao ang brown rice? Kanina
Po nabanggit na rin yung sa presyo, sa lasa, tsaka sa nakasanayan na, ano pa po kaya sa tingin ninyo?

2:NC-SE-02: Hindi siguro aware na masustansiya ang brown rice

2:NC-SE-0B: Sa tingin ko po yun na naman yung mga dahilan. Pwede naman talaga kumain ng brown rice kung
magmumura ang presyo at kung masasanay sa lasa.

‘MOD: Ngayon pong natikman na ninyo ang brown rice, sa tingin niyo po ba ay maisasama na ninyo sa pang-araw
‘araw ang pagkain ng brown rice?

2:NC-SE-09: Pwede kung healthy naman, pero di pa nin kami sigurado
2.NC-SE-08: Hindi siguro kami, mahal kasi

2-NC-SE.01: Kami naman, pwede pero hindi siguro palagi kasi mataas ang presyo. Siguro mga twice o thrice a
week lang kung kaya sa budget.

2-NC-SE-03: Kakain naman kami niyan kung may pambili kami

2.NC-SE.07: Samin 00, pero dapat magustuhan muna ng buong pamilya para lahat kakain na ng brown rice
2-NC-SE-04: Kami hindi, kasi baka kapusin sa budget eh marami pang ibang pinagkakagastusan.
2-NC-SE-06: Sakin okay naman kalasa naman ng putt, try ko siguro muna kung okay pang-araw araw.

‘MOD: Sa tingin niyo po, paano po ninyo makukumbinsi ang mga Pilipinong kumain ng brown rice sa pang-araw
araw?

2:NC-SE-03: Sabihin lang na maganda sa kalusugan ang brown rice kahit mahal
2:NC-SE-04: Oo nga tapos banggitin na okay naman ang lasa, Ialo pag lagi nang kinakain.

2.NC-SE-05: Pwede din imarket muna sa mga may sakit kasi sila naman makakabenepisyo, sabihin na
nakakabawas sa sakit at nakakapayat kasi kahit kaunti lang mabubusog ka na

2-NC-SE-08: Depende kung sino ang ikukumbinse mo. Kung normal na tao, sabihin na lang na masustansiya pero
‘mahihirapan ka kasi mahal nga

2-NC-SE-07: Sabihin nga na healthy, nakakatulong sa kalusugan, maganda sa katawan, yung ibang bigas gaya
1ng NFA may peke, yung ibang bigas may halo, ito mahirap pekein.

227

MOD: Sino po kaya ang pwedeng magsama ng brown rice sa pang-araw araw na pagkain?
2-NC-SE01: Sa tingin ko yung may kaya lang, kaya nila kahit araw araw brown rice.
2-NC-SE-03: Ang alam ko yung mga nagda-diet at mga may sakit gaya ng diabetes.
2.NC-SE-09: Yung mga health conscious siguro.

MoD:

luling tanong po, paano po kaya natin magagawang maging mas katanggap-tanggap yung brown rice?
2-NC-SE-05: Pababain yung presyo.

2-NC-SE-08: Oo nga, gawing kapresyo ng puting bigas,

2.NC-SE-01: linform ang mga tao ng mga benepisyo ng brown rice tsaka pamurahin

2-NC-SE-02: Sabihin na mas masustansiya kaysa white at mas maraming benefit.

2-NC-SE-04: Damihan ang tindang brown rice sa palengke.

‘MOD: Ayan, diyan na po nagtatapos ang ating usapan. Maraming salamat po sa pagpunta ninyo at pagparticipate
saFGD!

Moderator [Spiel]: Magandang umaga po sa inyong lahat. Ako po si Bea, ako po ay isang tagasiyasat sa pag-
‘aaral na ito. Ngayon po ay nasa pangalawang parte na po tayo ng pag-aaral, ang Focus Group Discussion o FGD.
Gaya po ng nakasaad sa inyong mga consent form, ang FGD ay gagawin upang mas maipaliwanag pa ang inyong
mga sagot sa survey kanina

MOD: Nais ko lamang po na ipakilala ang aking mga kasama sa pangongolekta ng pag-aaral na ito: si Yves.

Pag-uusap natin ay irerekord upang magsilbing gabay sa pagpoproseso ng inyong mga sagot

MOD: Ngayon po, may mga kaunting gabay lang po tayo sa FGD na ito, Ang una po ay sana tayo ay magsalita
1g isa isa lamang, para po malinaw at maintindinan ng lahat ang ating sagot. Maging honest po tayo sa ating mga
ssagot, maaari niyo pong sabihin ang inyong nais ngunit respetuhin din po natin ang sagot ng iba. Tandaan po natin
fra ito ay mga opinyon lang po natin at lahat ay may karapatan sa kanyang opinyon. Bigyan rin po nating ng
Pagkakataong magsalita ang bawat isa at umiwas po tayong magkaron ng mga “side conversations” na maaaring

‘MOD: Ayan po, ngayon po, maaari na tayong magsimula sa ating diskusyon. Magkaroon po muna tayo ng maikling
pakilanian. Ako po ulit si Bea. Kayo po?

3-SC-SE-05: ***

3-SC-SE-06: ***"* po.
‘MOD: Ngayon po, pag-usapan po natin ang pagkain. Ano po ba ang naiisip ninyo kapag sinabing “meal”?
3-$C-SE-05: Para sa akin ulam at kanin, para madaling mabusog

3-SC-SE-03: Sakin din po kanin tapos ang ulam madalas ay gulay. o kaya isda o manok

3-SC-SE-02: Pag sa akin pag agahan, tinapay at kape lang, pag tanghalian at hapunan, kanin at ulam
3-SC-SE-04: Kami din po ganon pero may prutas paminsan at siyempre tubig.

3-SC-SE-01: Pamilya ko madalas sa kame ang ulam.

221

3-SC-SE-06: Parehas din po sa kanila, kanin at ulam.

MOD: Ano naman po ang mga isinasaalang-alang ninyo sa pagpili ng kakainin?

3-S$C-SE-03: Siyempre kung ano gusto ng pamilya yun ang bibithin

3-SC-SE-06: Pero dapat po masustansya naman kahit papaano

3-SC-SE-01: Oo nga kasi dapat iprioriize ang health.

3-SC-SE-02: Yung mga bawal na pagkain sa matatanda di namin binibili kasi baka lumala pa sakit ni mama

3-SC-SE-05: Samin siempre isinasaalang alang din ang presyo ng bilihin kasi di lang naman pagkain ang
ginagastusan may mga bills din at gas, kaya dapat tipid din kahit madalas maalwan ang dating ng pera

3-SC-SE-04: Ang maidadagdag ko lang po ay dapat malinis yung bibilhin at maganda din para magustuhan ng
‘anak ko yung pagkain at di mahirap magpakain.

‘MOD: Maraming salamat po, ngayon naman po, pag-usapan naman po natin ang kanin. Ano po ba ang
pumapasok sa isip ninyo kapag sinabing "kanin"?

3-SC-SE-03: Masarap.

3-SC-SE-06: Oo nga po, masarap.

3-SC-SE-01: Sakin ang naiisip ko mabango.

3-SC-SE-05: Tapos maganda at madaling iluto,

3-SC-SE-02: Ang naiisip ko naman magandang isama sa ulam yung kanin
34SC-SE-04: Sang ayon ako, masarap nga sa lam

MOD: Ano naman pong kanin ang madalas ninyong kinakain na kanin?
3-SC-SE-04: Edi kanin, anong ‘anong kanin’ ba?

MOD: Kung anong klaseng kanin ba?

3-SC-SE-04: Ah samin puti, sinandomeng madalas, kasi yun na ang nakasanayan eh tsaka di masarap yung
brown nice

3-SC-SE-03: Oo nga, samin puti din kasi masarap. Malasa.
3-SC-SE-01: Bukod sa masarap yung white rice, yun lang kasi yung affordable.

3-SC-SE-02: Opo tama po, mura lang yung binibili namin, madalas NFA kasi marami kumain ng kanin mga kapatid
koeh

3-SC-SE-05: Kami naman po dinorado o maharlika kasi masarap lasa
3-SC-SE-06: Samin puti din kasi yun yung maraming pagpipilian eh.

MOD: Lahat po ay puti ang sagot. Pero gaya po ng ipinatikim namin sa inyo kanina, mayron din tayong tinatawag
na brown rice. Ano po kaya ang masasabi niyo sa brown rice?

3-SC-SE.02: Masarap naman po nung tinikman namin kanina
3+$C-SE-01: Okay lang naman yung lasa ng ibang klase ng brown, tapos ang alam ko healthy din.

3-SC-SE-06: Para sa akin po. parang matabang yung brown rice pag kasama ang ulam. Parang nawawalan ng
fasa ang ulam pag brown ice ang kanin.

3-SC-SE-04: Alam ko pang may diabetes lang yan, ako wala pa naman diabetes pero matanda na ko, parang
‘akong kumakain ng ipa diyan sa brown rice, maaligasgas kasi sa bibig.

230

3-SC-SE.03: Para sa akin naman okay lang po yung lasa pero mahal kasi yung brown rice.
3-SC-SE-05: Sakin okay lang din yung lasa kaso mahal at matagal iluto.

MOD: Ayan, merong okay ang lasa, meron ding hindi, pero sa tingin niyo po, bakit po kaya pinipili ng mga tao
kumain ng white rice kumpara sa brown rice?

3-SC-SE-01: Yun nga, gaya ng sinabi kanina, matabang daw kasi yung brown rice, tapos mahal pa at maaligasgas
ssa bibig. Hindi naman kasi nagtutugma yung lasa dun sa presyo.

3-SC-SE-04: Tsaka mahirap din hanapin yung brown rice, kakaunti lang sa palengke.

3-SC-SE.06: Mahirap na rin kasi baguhin yung nakasanayan na. Eh siguro sa 100 tao, wala pang sampu ang
rakatikim ng brown rice. Di pa kilala ng mga tao yan, foreigner kumbaga

MOD: Eh kung may pag-aaral pong magsasabi na mas maraming sustansiya ang kayang maibigay ng brown rice
kakain na po ba kayo ng brown rice? Bakit o bakit hindi?

34SC-SE-04: Mahirap kasi kahit gusto naman wala naman pambil, di ka rin makakakain kahit sabihin na
masustansiya. Tapos yung lasa pa, di katanggap-tanggap sa marami

3-SC-SE-01: Ako po siguro pwede, kung talagang masustansiya naman.
3-SC-SE-06: Ako sang-ayon ako kay tatay, hindi siguro dahil sa taas ng presyo.

MOD: Parang marami ay di pa rin pipiliin ang brown rice ano? Ngayon naman po, bakit po kaya di kinakain ng
mga tao ang brown rice? Ano kaya ang nagiging hadlang?

3-SC-SE-06: Di nila kilala yan eh.

3-SC-SE-02: Oo nga po, di pamilyar.

3SC-SE-03: Di rin nakasanayan ng marami

3-SC-SE-04: Tsaka di masyado masarap.

3-SC-SE-01: Oo nga, bukod sa lasa, mahal pa.

3-$C-SE-06: Lastly, di naman madaling hanapin sa palengke

MOD: Ngayon po bang natikman na ninyo ang brown rice, sa tingin niyo po ay maisasama niyo na ito sa pang-
araw araw na pagkain?

3-SC-SE-04: Hindi kami, mahal kasi, di kakayanin ng budget.
3-SC-SE-06: Sa tingin ko pwede naman kasi kung healthy naman, bakit hindi.
3-SC-SE-02: Samin paminsan pwede lalo pag may budget o kaya pag may sobra sa budget.

3-SC-SE-03: Pwede naman palitan yung puti kung gusto ng mga anak. pwede din ihalo sa puti yung brown para
di masyado mahal

3-SC-SE-01: Ako hindi pa ako makapagdecide ngayon

3-$C-SE.05: Samin pwede naman.

MOD: Pano po kaya natin makukumbinse ang mga tao na kumain ng brown rice?
3-SC-SE-06: Sabihin na lang na masarap naman, masasanay din pag naglaon

3+SC-SE-03: Ipaalam din na healthy ang brown rice at kung ano bang mga sustansiya ang makukuha nila dun,
Kasi yun yung binabayaran nilang mas mahal sa brown rice.

3-SC-SE-01: Pwede ding banggitin na nakakatulong ang regular na pagkain sa brown rice sa high blood at
diabetes.

234

MOD: Sino po kaya ang pwedeng magsama ng brown rice sa pang araw-araw na pagkain?
3-SC-SE-03: Pwede siguro ang mga pangkaraniwang tao kung bababaan ang presyo.
3-$C-SE-04: Mga health conscious o kaya mga may sakit

3-SC-SE.01: Matatanda pwede din.

3-SC-SE05:

ing alam ko sa mga nagdidiet talaga yan eh.

3-SC-SE-02: Pwede din sa mga nakakaalam na masustansiya ang brown rice.
3-SC-SE-06: Yung mga nirekomendahan ng doctor na magbantay ng kinakain,
MoD:

kay po. Paano naman po kaya mas magiging katanggap-tanggap ang brown rice sa mga tao?
3-SC-SE-06: Dapat matikman muna ng mga tao at malaman nila na mabuti sa katawan at mabitamina,

3-SC-SE-03: Dapat din siguro sanayin kumain ang mga tao ng brown rice para masanay yung paniasa, saka dapat
pamurahin yung presyo.

3-SC-SE-04: Sabihin na bukod sa kulay niya, kanin din naman yung brown rice.
3-SC-SE-05: Pwede pa ba ayusin yung lasa? Para hindi matabang?
MOD: Titingnan po natin. Actually pwede naman po iconsider yung mga suhestiyon niyo.

MOD: At diyan na po nagtatapos ang ating FGD. Maraming maraming salamat po sa inyo!

usapan, ano naman po ang naiisip ninyo kapag binabanggit ang salitang “kanin"?

4-SC-SE-04: Pag kanin masarap tsaka nakakabusog

4-SC-SE-02: Tama po yon, nakakabusog talaga yung kanin

4-SC-SE-05: Ako lagi ko naiisip kasama ng kanin ay ulam,

MOD: Ano naman pong klase ng kanin ang kinakain ninyo sa bahay?
4-SC-SE-02: Dinorado po kasi masarap kainin

4-SC-SE-03: Kami kahit anong puti basta halagang 45 pesos o mas mababa pa
4-SC-SE-05: Puti, sinandomeng kasi yun lang ang kaya

4-SC-SE-01: Kami kung anong makitang mura sa palengke

4-SC-SE-04: Parehas din po sa kanila

4-SC-SE-06: Oo nga po.

MOD: Ano naman po ang tingin ninyo sa brown rice?

4-SC-SE-02: Okay naman ang lasa tsaka parang mas healthy ata ang brown rice.
4-SC-SE-03: Sakto lang naman yung lasa pero parang pang maysakit naman yun
4-SC-SE-01: Okay lang din po yung lasa para sa akin kaso mahal yata ang kilo.
4-SC-SE-04: Yun lang mahal talaga ang brown rice.

4-SC-SE-06: Di masyado masarap pero nakakabusog naman,

4-SC-SE-05: Nakakabusog pero mahal naman.

‘MOD: Bakit po kaya pinipili ng mga tao ang white rice kaysa sa brown rice?

4-SC-SE-02: Mas mura po kasi yung white eh.
‘4-SC-SE-01: Tsaka di alam ng ibang tao yung brown rice at di din nakasanayan
4-SC-SE-04: Oo nga mas kilala ng mga tao.

4-SC-SE-03: Sa presyo po siguro at sa lasa

4-SC-SE-06; Tama, mas affordable kasi yung puting kanin.

4-SC-SE-05: Mas affordable na mas maganda pang lagyan ng sabaw.

MOD: Pero kung sabihin ko po na maraming pag-aaral na nagsasabing mas maganda sa katawan ang brown rice,
kakain na po ba kayo ng brown rice?

4-SC-SE-03: Hindi ata, kasi kahit masustansiya, mahal naman.

4-SC-SE-01: Pwede, masarap naman eh baka iadjust na lang yung budget sa bahay pag natutunan na naming
kumain ng brown rice.

4-SC-SE-06: Di ko sure eh, depende kung magustuhan sa bahay.
4-SC-SE-02: Oo, pero matagal pa, health conscious din kasi kami
4-SC-SE-05: Kami di siguro,

4-SC-SE-04: Di rin

MOD: Bakit po kaya di kinakain ang brown rice ng mga tao? O ano po kaya yung mga pangunahing dahilan sa
hindi pagkain ng brown rice?

4-SC-SE-02: Hindi kasi sanay, kulang pati sa awareness, at yung affordability niya di maganda
‘4-SC-SE-05: Saka di din po malasa yung brown, May kakaibang lasa.

4-SC-SE-01: Pwedeng pangdiet.

4-SC-SE-04: Sabihin na mas masustansiya siya sa white rice,

4-SC-SE-06: At mas maraming sustansya ang makukuha sa brown rice,

4-SC-SE-03: Para sa akin, depende sa taong icoconvince, depende kung matanda, bata, may sakit o wala
4-SC-SE-05: Ako walang masasabi kasi baka sabihin ako nga di kumakain ng brown rice eh.

8-SC-SE-05: Kung kaya ng budget edi okay ako diyan kaso mahal eh

5-SC-SE-06: Hindi, kasi mas sanay na kasi $a puti

MOD: Okay, iba-iba po tayo ng pananaw, pero sa tingin niyo po, bakit kaya di masyadong kinakain ng mga tao
yung brown rice?

5-SC-SE-02: Di nakasanayan kasi yan ng mga tao eh.
8-SC-SE-06: Hindi nakikita madalas sa palengke nga yan
5-SC-SE-03: Mahal

MOD: Ayan po, magsisimula na tayo, dahil ang kanin po ay karaniwan nating kinakain, simulan natin sa pagkain.
Pag sinabing pagkain, ano ang naiisip niyo pag sinabing pagkain?

6-SC-SE-05: Kanin?
6-SC-SE-07: Ulam at kanin nga siguro.

6-SC-SE-08: Sa bahay kanin at ulam tiyaka tubig,
6-SC-SE.01: Isda, kanin di

‘guiay.

6-SC-SE-04: Gulay, kanin nalang din siguro.

6-SC-SE-02: Sa akin, isda, manok, kanin

6-SC-SE-03: Kami sanay sa gulay, processed food, kanin
6-SC-SE-06: Sa amin naman itlog, hotdog, prito, kanin

MOD: Kapag naman po bibili kayo ng pagkain, ano yung isinasaalang.

3ng niyo $a pagpili? Anong mga aspekto?
6-SC-SE-01: Yung masarap yung hinahanap ko eh.

6-SC-SE-03: Kami naman, kung ano kinakain ng mga bata yun na rin yung kinakain namin, para di sayang sa
iam,

6-SC-SE-02: Ang isinasaalang-alang namin ay yung masustansiya.

6-SC-SE-06: Bukod sa sustansiya pati siguro yung sariwa yung mga sangkap.

6-SC-SE-04: Pangunahin naman samin yung presyo tiyaka yung credibility ng binibithan

6-SC-SE-08: Ganon din po, dapat masustansiya, tsaka yung presyo din.

MOD: So marami po tayong isinasaalang alang sa pagpili ng kakainin ano. Merong sustansiya, lasa, presyo,
kalinisan at iba pa. Ngayon naman po dako naman tayo sa pokus ng pag-aaral na ito, ang kanin. Kapag po sinabing
kanin, ano ang naiisip niyo? Ano yung pumapasok sa isip niyo?

6-SC-SE.01: Para sa akin, yun yung pinakamaraming kinakain sa hapag

6-SC-SE-03: Nakakabusog din yung kanin.

6-SC-SE-08: Pag binabanggit yung kanin, naiisip ko ulam yung masarap na kapares.

6-SC-SE-06: Ako din po yon, masarap na ulam.

6-SC-SE-09: Pag kanin usapan, ang masarap dun yung buhaghag

6-SC-SE-05: Sa akin naman bigas ang naiisip ko pag sinasabing kanin

MOD: Ayun, marami po pag sinasabing kanin, ang naiisip ay nakakabusog, masarap, at bigas. Tanungin ko naman
po kayo, sa bahay po, ano yung klase ng kanin na madals niyong bilhin at kainin?

6-SC-SE-02: Sa amin puti ang kinakain, kasi yun na yung nakasanayan eh.
6-SC-SE-07: Kami din ganon. dinorado ang madalas naming binibil.

6-SC-SE-05: Samin naman jasmine gawa ng mabango at malambot di gaya ng iba
6-SC-SE-04: Kami, dinorado din, kasi ayun nga malambot din yun at masarap kainin
6-SC-SE-03: Kami basta pul, walang kumakain ng brown rice samin

6-SC-SE-08: Ganon din samin

In
is

MOD: Sige po. Gayong puro puti ang kinakain nating kanin, maiba naman tayo, dako na po tayo sa pinaka-topic
natin, pag po sinabing brown rice, ano po ang una niyong naisip?

6-SC-SE-03: Pano po yung hindi pa nakakain nun o nakabili nung brown rice?
MOD: Kahit po yung mga nababalitaan niyo lang tungkol sa brown rice.

6-SC-SE-03: Sige, ang alam ko sa mga may sakit daw yun eh. Pero kanina ayos naman ang lasa nung tinikman
namin medyo matigas lang

6-SC-SE-01: Ang pagkakaalam ko yung brown rice masustansya daw yun, kaso mabilis makabusog yun eh,
agsubok kami isang beses, parang kalahati lang nung puti, nakakabusog na.

6-SC-SE-09: Mahal yang brown rice, mayayaman lang kumakain nyan.

‘6-SC-SE-02; Ngayon ko tang po natikman ang brown rice, ang pakilasa ko sa kanya, matabang,
6-SC-SE-08: Oo nga po, matabang

6-SC-SE-06: Kaya nga walang kumakain nun samin kasi bukod sa mahal, matabang nga

6-SC-SE-07: Para sa akin, ganun din, matabang tapos magalasgas sa bibig tapos ayun nga, mahal pa siya.

MOD: Yung iba po ngayon lang nakatikim ng brown rice, pero parang nagkakasundo naman po sa mahal pero sa
tingin niyo po, bakit kaya mas pinipiling mga tao na bumili nung puting bigas kaysa sa brown na bigas?

6-SC-SE-02: Una diyan yung presyo, kasi yung mga tigtrenta nga hinahanap namin na bigas. hirap pa makahanap.
Tapos yung lasa, matabang talaga. Para sa akin di talaga sisikat yan.

6-SC-SE-03: Oo nga kasi yung mga tao naman walang masyadong pakialam sa sustansiya 0 benepisyo ng kanin
eh, basta kung ano yung mura, yun na yung bibilhin kasi marami nga bumili yung iba, baka maubos lang sa kanin,

6-SC-SE-06: Tama yan tsaka sanay na sa white rice yung mga tao tiyaka yun yung mas masarap eh
6-SC-SE-08: Bukod sa sanay na sa white rice, wala pang mabiling brown rice na mura sa palengke.
6-SC-SE.09: Ako naman di ko gusto yung lasa nun eh, di siya masarap. kaya siguro di din pinipili ng mga tao.
‘MOD: Ayun po ano, puro negatibo ngayon ang nakikita natin sa brown rice, nandiyan yung mahal tapos yung sa
asa, ngayon po, kung sakalt kayang may ipakita kaming patunay na pag-aaral na mas masustansiya ang brown
rice kaysa sa white rice, piplin niyo na bang kainin o bilhin ito?

6-SC-SE-02: Pwede naman siguro basta maging mas mura o sana kahit kasing presyo nung putt

6-SC-SE-03: Ganun din para sa akin, sa pinansiyal din kasi yung pinagbabasehan ko eh

6-SC-SE-05: Sa akin naman, depende kung magustuhan ng pamilya ko.

6-SC-SE-06: Oo, siguro basta para sa kalusugan, pero di palagi, tsaka kailangan ding sanayin muna
6-SC-SE-04: Oo nga, ganun din, pwede siguro kasi kung maganda naman sa kalusugan eh

6-SC-SE-07: Pwede siguro basta magustuhan ng pamilya lato nung mga bata, kasi nga matabang eh,

MOD: May payag po at di payag pumili ng brown rice kahit na malamang masustansiya ito. Ngayon. sa tingin niyo
po. bakit kaya di tinatangkilik ng mga tao yung brown rice? Kayo po, sa personal niyong karanasan, bakit di kayo
kumakain ng brown rice?

6-SC-SE-02: Mahal kasi at matabang pa.
6-SC-SE-05: Nakasanayan na kasi yung put
6-SC-SE-07: Bukod sa mat
6-SC-SE-09: 00 nga

1, di din masarap kasi.

Ino
xy

MOD: Ayun po, nag-aagree naman yung iba sa sagot nila? Kung wala na po. sa tingin niyo, ngayong nakatikim
na kayo ng brown rice, kaya niyo kayang isama sa pang-araw-araw niyong buhay yung pagkain ng brown rice?

6-SC-SE-09: Sakin hindi palagi at tiingnan ko muna kung okay lang din sa pamilya ko.
6-SC-SE.06: Tama nga, pwede, kung okay sa pamilya ang lasa,

6-SC-SE-07: Samin hindi, di kasi masarap at mahal pa

6-SC-SE-08: Sakin din hindi, dahil hindi ko gusto ang lasa.

MOD: Hati naman po tayo kung isasama na ang brown rice sa pang-araw araw. Ngayon naman po, kung bibigyan
kayo ng pagkakataong kumbinsihin yung ibang tao ng brown rice, ano yung sasabihin niyo?

6-SC-SE-02: Sabihin na lang na mas masustansiya, yun lang naman ang lamang ng brown eh
6-SC-SE-08: Oo nga, sabihin na maganda sa kalusugan kahit di masarap.

6-SC-SE.07: Pwedeng sabihin na masustansiyanga, pero mahirap mangumbinse kasi ako mismo di kumakain o
walang planong kumain nun.

‘MOD: Sa patagay niyo po, sino 0 anong klase ng mga tao yung madalas na naisasama sa pagkain nila ang brown,
rice?

6-SC-SE-01: Yung mga matatanda siguro.

6-SC-SE-04: Mahal yan kaya siguro yung may mga kaya sa buhay ang pwede, yung mga mayayaman.
6-SC-SE-03: Yung matataba, pangdiet daw yan eh

6-SC-SE-07: Mga may kaya at may sakit

6-SC-SE-06: Mayayaman nga lang naiisip ko eh.

6-SC-SE-09: Yung magkakagusto siguro sa lasa, matabang kasi eh.

Mop:

-aano po kaya mas magiging katanggap-tanggap yung pagkain ng brown rice sa mga tao?

6-SC-SE-01: Gawing marami ang mapagpipilian, kung may brand na mas mura o kung meron yung walang brand.
6-SC-SE-03: Babaan presyo, kapantay ng puting bigas.

6-SC-SE-06: Babaan nga ang presyo at kung pwede pasarapin pa siya

6-SC-SE.09: Bigyan ng impormasyon ang mga tao tungkol sa kung anong sustansiya ang makukuha sa brown
rice at babaan ang presyo

MOD: Sige po, tapos na tayo, yun na po ang huling tanong. Maraming salamat po sa pagbibigay panahon
gayong wala na po kayong idadagdag, kung may mga katanungan po kayo, tanungin niyo lang kami

7-NC-SE-11: Dapat din gusto ng pamilya yung bibihin na pang-ulam, ayun na ang kakainin

T-NC-SE-07: Oo nga

7-NC-SE-09: Pero dapat masarap din.

7-NC-SE-12: Bukod sa sustansya, kung ano yung mga puwedeng bilhin lalo pag maraming bawal dun sa mga
kasama kong kumain.

MOD: Ayun po, yung iba? [walang karagdagang kasagutan} Dahil po diyan, kung wala nang isasagot yung iba,
lipat na tayo ng question. Kapag po napag-wusapan ang kanin, anong naiisip niyo?

T-NC-SE-04: Panong naiisip?

IN
Io

MOD: Ano pong naiisip niyo pag sinabi yung kanin, anong mga ideya ang umikot sa isip niyo?
7-NC-SE-01: Kahit ano ba yan?

MOD: Opo
7-NC-SE-01: Parang halimbawa, masarap sa ulam yung kanin ganun?

MOD: Opo, ayos na po yan, kahit ano po talaga ang isagot, basta may kinalaman sa tanong, wala naman pong
tama o mali. Yung iba po?

7-NC-SE-13: Ang kanin maganda sa kalusugan pag hinay hinay lang
T-NC-SE-03: Nakakabusog yung kanin

7-NC-SE-08: Ang naiisip ko sa kanin mabango.

7-NC-SE-05: Dapat masarap kahit di masyado masarap ang ulam
7-NC-SE-04: Masarap kasama ng ulam, yun din eh, wala nakong maisip.
7-NC-SE-07: Yang kanin di pwedeng mawala sa pananghalian.

T-NC-SE-09: Masarap ang kanin kahit kaunti o walang maiulam diba yung iba kahit asin kanin lang okay na, busog
na

7-NC-SE-11: Ang naiisip ko naman masarap iluto yung bigas.
‘MOD: Sa bahay niyo po kaya, anong klase ng bigas 0 kanin ang binibili niyo at kinokonsumo niyo?
7-NC-SE-12: Yung binibili namin yung puti na mura, yung laon.

7-NC-SE-13: Samin sa bahay dinorado yung binibili namin kasi masarap kumain kapag yun yung kanin eh,
‘napaparami kami ng kanin

7-NC-SE-03: Samin naman white rice din kasi yun naman talaga ang binibili na kasi mura, pare-pareho lang
namang bigas yan eh, nakakabusog naman lahat.

T-NC-SE-02: Puti din po sa amin.
7-NC-SE-11: Oo nga, yung puti din kasi mas madaling hanapin yun eh

7-NC-SE-01: Kami naman NFA dahil sa presyo

7-NC-SE-04: Kami kahit ano basta puti

7-NC-SE-07: Jasmine sa bahay. kasi mabango at masarap kahit mas mahal sa NFA
7-NC-SE-08: Kami naman di mapili, basta kahit anong white rice.

7-NC-SE-10: Oo nga, puti din kasi nakasanayan na

MOD: Ayan po, napag-usapan natin ang kani
naman ang masasabi niyo roon?

at lahat kayo rito ay puti ang kinakain. Yung brown rice po, ano

7-NC-SE-10: Narinig ko lang yang brown rice, kinakain daw yan nung may mga diabetes, tama ba? Kasi yung
biyenan ko yan na yung kinakain kasi nga may diabetes siya, Gamot daw yan sa diabetes eh, Nung tinikman ko
kanina, medyo okay naman.

7-NC-SE-05: Alam mo masarap naman yang brown rice kaso pag sinama sa ulam naiiba na. May sari kasing
lasa yan eh kaya pag yan ang kinakain namin, yan lang, nilulugaw ko pero walang ulam.

T-NC-SE-03: Oo, masarap naman kaso nga yung sa presyo talaga nagkakatalo,

7-NC-SE-02: Ang alam ko mahirap lutuin yun kasi kailangan pang ibabad mga 30 minutes bago iluto kasi pag di
binabad matigas yung kanin na yun, Pero sa lasa, okay naman, medyo matigas nga lang

247

T-NC-SE-01: Ay sa akin di ko gusto yung lasa nun tapos mahal pa.

7-NC-SE-07: Masustansya daw yan, yan ngang sinasabi nila, pero marami di pa nakatikim.
7-NC-SE-09: Para sa akin, matabang na tapos mahal pa ang per kilo niyan, pang mayaman lang.
7-NC-SE-11: Okay lang sakin pero parang walang lasa, parang nakakawala pa ng lasa nung ulam.

MOD: Sa iba po okay naman ang lasa ng brown at maraming nagsabi na masustansiya, pero sa tingin niyo po.
bakit kaya mas pinipiling mga tao yung bilhin yung puting kanin kaysa sa brown rice?

7-NC-SE-07: Kasi nakasanayan na yung puti ivaka mas masarap yun.

7-NC-SE-01: Oo nga, mas masarap yung puti, hindi pa matabang,

7-NC-SE-02: Di pa kasi kilala yung brown, dapat ipakilala muna sa mga tao yan.
7-NC-SE-13: Bukod sa lasa, sa price din

7-NC-SE-06: Oo nga, di hamak na mas mura kase yung put

7-NC-SE-08: Matabang at matigas yung brown rice eh

7-NC-SE-12: Tama yan, sa lasa talaga, mas magandang lagyan ng sabaw yung white.

MOD: Ngayon, nakita po natin yung mga negatibo ng brown rice. Kung sakali pong malaman natin na may pag-
aaral na masustansya ng brown rice over sa white, tatangkilikin na po ba natin yung brown rice?

7-NC-SE-01: Pwede, kung heatthy naman sabi niyo eh, pero di madalas,
7-NC-SE-07: Siguro subukan muna namin, kung masanay edi okay.
7-NC-SE-13: Pwede siguro pero depende sa budget.

7-NC-SE-03: Para sa akin 09, basta nakakabuti

7-NC-SE-06: Oo nga, kung gusto rin ng pamilya, alo yung mga bata mapili eh.

7-NC-SE-11: Sa presyo lang talaga ang problema eh, kung mura lang yan edi yan na bibilhin namin, marami na
siguro ang makakatikim.

7-NC-SE-02: Kung magsstay na mahal pa rin yung presyo, baka hindi na
7-NC-SE-04: Oo nga, hindi Kase mahal ang brown rice.

7-NC-SE-09: Sa akin pwede din kung may nakukuha,

7-NC-SE-10: For me, yes, dahil nga mas madami ang naibibigay na sustansya
7-NC-SE-12: Oo naman, healthy daw eh.

MOD: Ano kaya yung mga dahilan kung bakit hindi binibili ng mga tao yung brown rice? Sa inyong personal na
karanasan, bakit di kayo bumibili ng brown rice?

7-NC-SE-07: Ganto, ito lang talaga yan eh, para di na tayo paulit-ult, yung brown rice kasi di kilala ng mga tao,
bukod dun yung presyo at lasa ang problema ng bigas na yan. Nag-aagree po ba tayo dun?

MOD: Sige po, kung naga-agree kayo sa next na question na tayo.
7-NC-SE-04: Sanay din kasi yung mga tao sa puti eh

‘MOD: Sige po, sa tingin niyo po kaya niyo bang isama ang pagkain ng brown nice sa pang-araw-araw niyong

7-NC-SE-07: Depende din sa kukuha yan eh, dapat ityy muna nila

7-NC-SE-12: Para sa mga may sakit, sabihin na maganda sa katawan.

MOD: Sa tingin niyo naman po, sino yung mga taong nakakakain ng brown rice sa pang-araw-araw?
7-NC-SE-02: Siguro yung mga mayayaman, may kaya sa buhay.

7-NC-SE-03: Yung mga diet at may sakit

7-NC-SE-12: Oo nga, yung mga nagdidiyeta

7-NC-SE-13: Yung mga health conscious siguro, yung matatanda at diabetic kasi kailangan nila yun
MOD: Sa tingin niyo po, para kaya mas maging katanggap-tanggap yung brown rice. ano ang mga dapat gawin?
7-NC-SE-04: Dapat malaman ng mga tao yung benepisyo niyang brown rice

7-NC-SE-05: Gawing available, dapat mabibili kahit saan.

7-NC-SE-07: Yung mapamura yung presyo para swak sa budget.

8-NC-SE.07: ""*"™* po,

MOD: Pagbati, dadako na po tayo sa unang tanong. Bago ang kanin, simulan muna natin sa mas mataas na
sangay. Kapag po sinabing meal, pangkaraniwang pagkain, ano ang una niyong naiisip?

‘8-NC-SE-06: Para sa akin, yung may ulam at siyempre yung may kanin.

8-NC-SE-01: Ganon sakin, kanin, kame, manok, baboy siguro.

‘8-NC-SE-07: Samin din ganon po, yung palaging ulam namin ay may sabaw at prito.
'8-NC-SE-02: Kami naman sinigang na baboy, may sabaw at kanin

8-NC-SE-04: Kami pareho din, kanin at ulam lang

8.NC-SE-03: Sakin minsan tinapay madalas kanin tapos processed foods.
8-NC-SE-08: Ganon din po, ulam, madalas baboy, kanin, at mga ulam na lutong bahay.
8-NC-SE-09: Kami madalas gulay. adobo at kanin.

8-NC-SE-05: Sakin paborito ko tinapay na may hotdog,

8-NC-SE-10: Kami din kanin, ulam, gulay tsaka softdrinks.

MOD: Okay po marami pong mga pagkain ang kinakain natin. Pag naman po bibili kayo nung mga pagkain na
yun, ano yung mga isinasaalang-alang niyo?

8-NC-SE-10: Samin depende sa gutom eh, kung anong gusto kong kainin, pero nandiyan pa rin yung tinitingnan
ko yung presyo siyempre.

8-NC-SE-01: Sakin sa lasa din ako nagbabatay. di ka naman siguro bibiling hindi masarap sa panlasa mo.
8-NC-SE.07: Ako ganon din, lasa at siyempre sustansiya

8-NC-SE-08: Sakin naman yung sustansya, lasa at presyo

8-NC-SE-03: Siyempre yung makabubuti ba sa kalusugan, dapat masustansya nga

8-NC-SE-02: Yun nga po, yung sariwa at masustansiya rin.

8-NC-SE-04: Pareho din po sakin, sa lasa at presyo ang tintingnan ko

MOD: Okay po, ang madalas nating tinitingnan ay yung presyo, lasa at sustansiya. Ano naman po ang masasabi
niyo tungkol sa kanin? Anong ideya niyo pag nabanggtt ang salitang kanin?

8-NC-SE-08: Naisip ko masarap yung kanin lalo yung buhaghag
8-NC-SE-05: Ang naiisip ko. ulam siyempre, kapartner ng kanin,
8-NC-SE-02: Oo nga talaga, pag kanin masarap sa ulam yan,

8-NC-SE-01: Iba ang nai

ip ko, mabigat sa tiyan ang kanin kaya nga pag walang kanin parang kulang
8-NC-SE.07: Ako ganon din po ang naiisip ko ay masarap na may ulam ang kanin

8-NC-SE-09: Kaya nga nakakabusog

8-NC-SE-10: Sa tanghalian kinakain madalas ay kanin at ulam.

MOD: So ang naiisip po natin pag kanin ay ulam, masarap, at nakakabusog. Kayo po ba, sa bahay niyo po. ano
‘ang madalas niyong binibiling bigas? Anong uri, anong kiase?

8-NC-SE-07: Samin white rice, yun ang kadalasan

Ino
lor

‘8.NC-SE-01: Samin din puti, yun lang ang kaya ng budget.

‘8-NC-SE-02: Kami naman yung dinorado, masarap kasi kainin.

8-NC-SE-09: Sa bahay din white rice, mas masarap kasama ng ulam yun eh,
8-NC-SE-03: Ako jasmine lagi ang binibili ko.

8-NC-SE-04: Kami din ganon po, puting kanin, kahit anong kiase po
8-NC-SE-05: White rice din, yun naman kadalasan eh

MOD: Dahil yung kinakain po natin ay puti ano, ano naman pong masasabi niyo sa brown rice? Ano yung mga
nababalitaan niyo?

-NC-SE-01: Kanina nung natikman ko, parang matabang siya
8-NC-SE-08: Para sa akin, masarap naman, kaso ayaw ng mga bata, natatabangan din sila

8-NC-SE-03: Ako naman first time kong makatikim kanina, parang ayos naman lasa. Pero ang alam ko para sa
mga diabetic yan.

8-NC-SE-09: Ang pakilasa ko matabang at ang alam ko medyo mahirap lutuin, kailangan pang ibabad tapos madali
siyang mapanis.

‘8-NC-SE-04: Para sa akin ay matabang at maaligasgas yung brown rice
8-NC-SE-10: Ang alam ko diyan mahal tapos mahirap pang hanapin kaya di kaya pang araw-araw.

MOD: Sa tingin niyo po, bakit po kaya mas pinipili ng mga tao yung white rice kaysa sa brown rice? Kahit base sa
Personal na karanasan po.

8-NC-SE-02: Sa tingin ko, lagi kasing white na yung binibil, kahit sa probinsya di naman nakikita yung brown rice
eh

8-NC-SE-03: Mataas lang talaga ang presyo ng brown rice, bukod dun sa di kilala
8-NC-SE.01: Sa akin, yung brown rice mahal at di maganda itsura.
8-NC-SE.07:

Mas maganda ang itsura at lasa [ng white rice] at mas mura,

8-NC-SE-04: Kami naman sanay na kami sa lasa nung puti eh, kaya alam na rin namin na maganda ang kalidad
fun

8-NC-SE-08: Oo nga, mas masarap tapos madaling lutuin yung white
8-NC-SE-10: Sang-ayon ako diyan,

MOD: Nakita po natin yung mga negative side nung brown rice, ngayon po, kung tatanungin kayo, kung sakaling
malalaman niyong masustansya ang brown rice kaysa sa put, willing ba kayong bumili nito sa pang-araw-araw?

8-NC-SE-06: Ako ayoko, kasi mas masarap at mura ang white rice
8-NC-SE-02: Oo nga, pwede kung mabuti sa katawan, basta kaya ng budget

8-NC-SE-04: Ako hindi, kasi natatabangan ako sa brown rice at wala pa naman ako sakit para Kumain nun,
8-NC-SE-07: Oo nga, pag siguro nagustuhan ng pamilya at Kung maganda talaga sa kalusugan.
8-NC-SE-03: Ako ayoko talaga kasi na-try na namin yan sa bahay, ayaw na namin ulin

8-NC-SE-10: Pwede naman kung kaya ng budget sabi nga nila.

mop:

"ero sa tingin niyo po, bakit kaya hindi binibili ng mga tao ang brown rice?

8-NC-SE-03: Ayaw kasi nung mga anak ko yan eh, di nila nagustuhan yung lasa.

Ino
Ion
IS

8-NC-SE.04: Mahal din kasi

MOD: Kung bibigyan naman kayo ng pagkakataon, bibilhin niyo ba ang brown rice at kakainin sa pang-araw-araw,
alo po ngayon na natikman niyo na ang brown?

8-NC-SE-05: Kung maganda sa katawan try muna namin kung ok

8-NC-SE.03: Kung ako lang puwede, pero di kasi gusto nung mga bata

8-NC-SE-10: Siguro paminsan lang, pero imimix sa puti para mura.

8-NC-SE-08: Minsan lang siguro kase matabang at mahal.

8-NC-SE-04: Kami naman siguro kung kaya ng budget.

8-NC-SE-06: Para sa akin, pwede, kung gugustuhin din ng pamilya kumain,

8-NC-SE-07: Sa tingin ko 00, kung masustansya at pag nagmura

MOD: Kung kukumbinsihin niyo naman po yung mga tao na bumiling brown rice, ano ang sasabihin niyo?
8-NC-SE-07: Sabihin na nakakapayat yung brown rice.

8-NC-SE-01: Masustansiya yung brown kaysa sa white,

8-NC-SE-03: Wala, kase ako mismo hindi sigurado na kakain or bibili ng brown rice dahil sa presyo at iasa

MOD: Sa tingin niyo po, sino naman yung mga taong naisasama sa pang-araw-araw nila ang pagkain ng brown
rice?

8-NC-SE-03: Yung mayayaman siguro.
8:NC-SE-06: Tingin ko yung mga nagdidiet tivaka yung matatanda.

8-NC-SE.08: May kaya rin nga, kasi mahal nga yan tiyaka siguro mas alam nila yung benepisyo niyan
8-NC-SE-05: Yung mga health conscious siguro,

MOD: Pano po kaya mas magiging katanggap-tanggap yung brown rice sa mga tao?

8-NC-SE-01: Babaan sana ang presyo kasi ang mahal eh, di namin kaya kasi may alternatibo naman, yung put
kaya bakit pa kami bibili nung brown.

8-NC-SE-09: Babaan nga ang presyo at sanayin ang mga tao kumain, sana may proyekto yung gobyerno para
makita ng mga tao yung epekto niyan.

8.NC-SE-10: Oo nga, ibaba ang presyo at sana matikman ng lahat.
‘8.NC-SE-08: lintroduce ang brown rice sa mga tao para masubukan parang yung sinabi niya,

MOD: Maraming salamat po, ayun lang po. Kung may katanungan kayo, sabihan niyo lang kami o kontakin kami
