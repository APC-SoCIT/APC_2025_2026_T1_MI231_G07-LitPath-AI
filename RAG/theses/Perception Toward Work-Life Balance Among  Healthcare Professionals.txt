Abstract  
Background:  Globally, work -life imbalance is a growing concern, especially among healthcare 
professionals like nurses and doctors. The ‘Work -Life Balance’ is a harmonious equilibrium between an 
individual's professional and personal responsibilities and being comfortable managing both work  and 
non-work obligations.  
Methods:  A descriptive single -centered quantitative study was conducted among 100 healthcare 
professionals (50 doctors and 50 nurses) in Kochi, focusing on work -life balance. Data was collected 
through a Semi -structured questionnaire to assess the socio -demographic data and a questionnaire for self -
assessin g work -life balance was used. The data was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential 
statistics. The comparison of work -life balance between nurses and doctors was computed by using an 
independent t -test. 
Results: The majority  (65%) of the  healthcare professionals  were  less than  thirty  years  old. Most of  them  
were married  (76%)  and had children  (47%) . There was a statistically significant association between 
monthly  income and  work -life balance  (P=0.001) . Around  23% of the health professionals had  a poor 
work -life balance, 57% had a borderline work -life balance and 20% of them maintained  a good work -life 
balance. There was a statistically significant  difference between  the work -life balance of nurses and 
doctors  (P=0.001) 
Conclusion:  The study findings revealed that majority of the healthcare professionals have a  borderline  
work -life balance, indicating the need for immediate action to prevent further issues from  escalating. 
Maintaining a balanced work -life is important  for healthcare productivity, job satisfaction,  positive  clinical 
outcomes, and  high-quality  patient  care and safety.

Introduction  
Maintaining a w ork-life balance is an important concern for both employers a nd employees. Every 
employed person has several responsibilities towards the family, society , and the organization. To 
maintain a healthy  work -life balance, it is essential to strike a balance between the responsibilities of one's 
personal life, friends, and family, and the demands of the workplace  [1] Creating and maintaining healthy 
work environments that support a balance between work and non -work components is a key component 
in achieving a work -life balance. Work -life balance enhances employee loyalty, p roductivity, job

satisfaction, and overall growth, while poor work -life balance can negatively impact physical, 
psychological, and behavioral patterns, affecting overall quality of life  [2]. 
Azeem S M et al. (2015) examined the impact of perceived work -life balance and job satisfaction on 
commitment among hospital employees across five hospitals. The results showed moderate work -life 
balance, with a mean score of 5.06. However, respondents per ceived work interfering with family life at 
4.43 and family interfering with work -life at 3.37. Consequently, job satisfaction and commitment levels 
were lower [3]. Similarly, Sharma S et al. (2018) conducted a study on work -life balance among 141 
doctors and 216 nurses in government hospitals of Himachal Pradesh and found that doctors and nurses 
use more leave arrangements, particularly cultural/religious leave (60% and 78%) and pooling of leave 
entitlements (67% and 62%) respectively [4]. 
Nowadays  due to the spread of globalization, technological advancements, and a highly competitive work 
environment , every successful employee  encounters the difficulty of striking a balance between their 
personal and professional lives  [5]. Stress and extended work hours can be major causes of burnout in 
certain work environments, which can ultimately  lead to increased  absenteeism, workplace aggression, 
and workers' compensation claims [6]. A review of the literature conducted by Satinder Singh determined 
how work -life balance and its practices  affect  various  quality -life factors including  job satisfaction, career 
growth, appreciation, work stress, turnover, absenteeism, and a competitive atmosphere  [7]. 
Healthcare organizations in both developed and developing countries face numerous challenges, including 
improving patient care quality, managing budgets , and addressing a shortage of skilled healthcare 
professionals.  Women doctors and nurses, despite nearly equal gender roles, often contribute timeless jobs 
for organizational benefits and have additional responsibilities like household and family care, leading to 
work -life imbalances [3]. 
A study was conducted among 656 nurses in Bangladesh and found a positive correlation between work -
life imbalance, employee dissatisfaction, and the impact of work on the family . The study highlights the 
importance of maintaining work -life balance for the efficiency of healthcare organizations, the provision 
of high -quality patient care, and successful therapeutic outcomes  [8]. 
Therefore, assessing the perception of healthcare professionals toward work -life balance is of great value 
and helps healthcare  professionals to take significant and immediate actions to achieve a desired balance 
before things get out of control  because  delaying necessary changes can worsen the situation.  
 
Methods  
A descriptive survey  was conducted among 100 healthcare  professionals  including nurses and doctors  in 
a selected hospital  in Kochi. A convenience sampling technique  was used to select the study participants 
who met the inclusion criteria . Permission to conduct the study was obtained from the medical and nursing 
director and an ethical clearance certificate was obtained from the Institutional Research and Ethics 
Committee. A n informed consent was obtained from  the study participants  before starting data collection. 
A Semi -structured questionnaire was used to collect the socio -demographic data and a structured 
questionnaire for self -assessing healthcare professionals' p erception of work -life balance  was used . The 
questionnaire rated collective behaviors and provided a score from 0 to 5, indicating good, borderline, or 
poor work -life balance.  IBM SPSS Version 20  was used to analyze  both descriptive and inferential 
statistics .

Discussion  
The concept of work -life balance has been acknowledged as a crucial concern in recent scenarios. In the 
present study , around  23% of the healthcare professionals had a poor work -life balance,  57% had a 
borderline work -life balance , and 20% of them maintained  a good work -life balance.   Similarly, the results 
of the study conducted by Syed Mohammad Azeem revealed a moderate work -life balance, job 
satisfaction, and organizational commitment among employees. [3].  
The findings of the present study were  supported by a comparative study conducted by  K. Vijaya Suganthi 
et al.  who compared the work -life balance of nurses in government and private hospitals in the Thiruvallur 
district  and found  a significant difference in work -life balance, impacting self -care, health issues, job 
satisfaction, and organizational commitment [ 9]. Similarly, a study by MAC. Fathima Aroosiya revealed 
a low level of work -life balance among 100 working women in Nintavur [1 0]. Even studies conducted 
among high -tech and banking industry  professionals revealed that long working hours significantly impact 
occupational stress, job satisfaction, and work -life balance  [11].  
In contrast, a descriptive survey among 67 nursing faculty  to assess the perception and attitude towards 
quality of work -life balance found that 86.57%  experienced a well -balanced work -life, 47.76% had high 
job satisfaction , and showed a positive correlation  (r= 0.77)between work -life balance and job satisfaction 
[12]. These findings were  consistent with the results of a study by Joey Blackburn et al. which showed , 
that Louisiana agriculture teachers were effective, satisfied, and able to balance their careers with family 
life, ensuring work did not interfere with family life  [13]. 
This study revealed that there was no statistically significant association between work -life balance and 
demographic variables like age, gender, marital status, and number of children; however, there was a 
significant association (p=0.001) between work -life balance and monthly in come. Around 23% of 
healthcare professionals under 30 years old reported a good work -life balance, wh ereas  26.3% of married 
professionals and 25% of health professionals with 2 or more children reported a poor work -life balance.  
A multi -group analysis by Francesco Pace et al. revealed gender differences in career opportunities, work -
life balance, and well -being perception, with women having lower values for career opportunities and

work -life balance affecting well -being more  [14]. Female nurses in government and private hospitals face 
significant challenges in balancing work and family responsibilities, with 53% struggling to achieve work -
life balance[ 15]. Similarly, another study explores the work -life balance experiences of women doctors 
and nurses in Malaysia found found that contextual factors like gender norms, dual professional duties, 
and collegiality, as well as healthcare sector staff shortages, significantly impact work -life balance  [16]. 
Whereas , in the present study , as compared to males  (3.8%) around 25.75% of females reported having a 
good work -life balance . 
A study among 14345 Taiwanese healthcare workers from 56 hospitals found a significant relationship 
between work -life balance and safety culture, mediated by emotional teamwork exhaustion and a climate. 
The study provides a model for designing interventions to improve patient safety culture in hospitals [ 17]. 
Similarly, the study conducted  by Schwartz SP, et al. found that work -life involvement behaviors among 
healthcare workers vary, with a positive climate associated with better teamwork, safety, and lower 
burnout  [18]. A study conducted by R. Priyadharshini et al. also  suggests that implementing work -life 
balance policies can boost the productivity and engagement of healthcare professionals, thereby enhancing 
job satisfaction [19]. This highlights the need for better safety culture norms in healthcare settings. In the 
present study, there was a significant difference between the work -life balance of nurses and doctors 
(p=0.001) . Both doctors and nurses play significant roles in healthcare delivery, but there are disparities 
in their work -life balance may be due to job nature, workplace relationships, social expe ctations, personal 
preferences, work settings, and lifestyle decisions.  
 
Conclusion  
Assessing work -life balance among health professionals is crucial for promoting conscious work -family 
balance. Those s truggling with work -life issues  should take  immediate action to achieve a healthy  balance 
between  work  and life which  prevents  further deterioration of well -being.  Delaying necessary changes 
could worsen the situation  and can lead to burnout , health issues , and strained relationships . A fulfilling 
healthcare career necessitates a healthy work -life balance which can be achieved through setting clear 
boundaries, prioritizing self -care activities, employee support policies, professional development 
opportunities, open communication, mutual  respect, flexible working hours, financial support, timely 
promotions, and recognition . Understanding perceptions of work -life balance among health professionals 
will lead to higher job satisfaction, better well -being, increased retention, enhanced health care 
productivity, positive clinical outcomes, and high -quality patient care and safety.  
 
Limitations  
As the study included only doctors and nurses the finding may not captured the perception of other health 
care professionals. This minimizes the generalizability of the findings.
