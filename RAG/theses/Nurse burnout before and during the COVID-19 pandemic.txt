/one.tnum. Introduction
A major problem worldwide is the shortage of medical personnel. As early as 2006, the
World Health Organization reported that the shortage of nurses and health workers has a
signiﬁcantnegativeimpactonimprovingthehealthandwellbeingoftheworld’spopulation
(1). The nursing profession in many countries faces increased rates of burnout caused
by unrealistic expectations of work, poor working conditions, work demands that exceed

personal resources, poor relationships between professionals, and
ultimatelyanincreaseinoccupationalhealthrisks( 2).
Burnout is characterized by a relatively rapid decline in
emotional, physical, and psychological energy as a result of
increased work stress. It often leads to a sense of low self-eﬃcacy
and results from work overload, a lack of control, resources, and
equity. It can also be caused by a lack of community and value
conﬂicts ( 3). The psychological phenomenon of burnout usually
consists of three main factors as follows: emotional exhaustion
(EE), i.e., emotional and physiological exhaustion due to work
stress, leading to a decrease in energy, fatigue, despair, depression,
and helplessness; depersonalization (DP), which refers to negative
and insensitive behavior toward others and detachment from the
needs of others and guidelines; and ﬁnally, a sense of low personal
accomplishment (PA), i.e., an evaluation of oneself as inadequate
andfailing( 4).Thesefeaturesofburnoutleadtoincreasedturnover
ratesandhaveanegativeimpactonthequalityofhealthcare.
This has been explained by the concepts of “compassion
fatigue”and“caringburden”( 5,6)asthehealthprofessionrequires
ahighlevelofrelationalandempathicengagement( 7).Ithasbeen

personal level, and alcohol and psychoactive substance abuse and
theriskofsuicidearehighamongburnoutsuﬀerers( 8).
The COVID-19 outbreak has created unique stressors and
challenges, especially for frontline nurses. These stressors and
challenges include moral and ethical issues ( 9). In Italy, Damico
et al. (10) found a prevalence of burnout-related symptoms
observed in at least 68% of nurses: 77.4% were at risk for
EE, 68.7% for DP, and 77.9% for decreased PA. In addition,
a statistically higher risk was observed among nurses in
COVID-19 wards for EE (54.4 vs. 30.6%, p<0.01), DP (39.7
vs. 23.6%, p=0.019), and decreased PA (44.8 vs. 29.2%, p
=0.027), suggesting that the risk of burnout was lower in
nurses who did not care for patients with COVID-19 during
theemergency.
Despite this evidence, critical levels of burnout in pre-
pandemic nurses were found in the literature among diﬀerent
types of units ( 11,12). Previous studies and reviews found
no diﬀerences in burnout, EE, DP, or PA between chronic
and acute units. Some authors argue that the level of nurses’
dissatisfaction may be related to increased workload combined
with a reduction in relationship time ( 13). Considering EE as
an isolated factor, it is signiﬁcantly higher among nurses in
the emergency department; DP, on the other hand, was not
found in this area but showed very high scores in chronic
units(14).
The international literature has focused heavily on burnout
in healthcare workers in the last 2 years, leading to possible
biases, such as the association of burnout with the COVID-19
pandemic. To our knowledge, an estimate of the diﬀerence
between burnout levels in nurses before and during the
COVID-19 pandemic is lacking. The aim of this review is,
therefore, to compare studies that looked at burnout levels in its
subcomponents EE, DP, and PA among nurses before and during
theCOVID-19outbreak./two.tnum. Materials and methods
/two.tnum./one.tnum. Instruments
The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is the most well-
known and extensively used instrument for evaluating burnout.
The theoretical foundations of the MBI are based on the tri-
dimensional model of burnout by Maslach ( 15), comprising
“exhaustion,” “cynicism,” and “ineﬀectiveness.” Maslach’s model
includes precise deﬁnitions for each dimension that align well
withthecorrespondingmeasurementtool.Therearecurrentlyﬁve
versions of the MBI as follows: (1) Human Services Survey (MBI-
HSS), (2) Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel [MBI-
HSS (MP)], (3) Educators Survey (MBI-ES), (4) General Survey
(MBI-GS),and(5)GeneralSurveyforStudents[MBI-GS(S)].
In a study conducted according to MOOSE (meta-analysis of
observationalstudiesinepidemiology)andthePRISMAguidelines
recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration ( 16), the degree of
burnoutistakenintoaccount( Table1).
/two.tnum./two.tnum. Procedure
/two.tnum./two.tnum./one.tnum. Protocol registration
The systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted
according to the protocol of the International Platform for
Registered Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. This study is
based on the development of published data; therefore, ethical
approval is not required. The study protocol was registered on
PROSPERO, the International Prospective Register of Systematic
Reviews,NationalInstituteofHealthResearch,UniversityofYork,
withtheregistrationnumber“CRD42023399628.”
/two.tnum./two.tnum./two.tnum. Literature search strategy
The analysis was conducted according to the steps of the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses(PRISMA)procedure(seeﬂowchart).Toidentifyrelevant
studies, we searched the Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, and
theCINAHLPlus(CumulativeIndexofNursingandAlliedHealth
Literature)databases.Detailedsearchtermswereacombinationof
“nurse,”“burnout,”“burnoutsyndrome,”“MBI,”“MaslachBurnout
Inventory,” and “COVID-19.” Studies that examined burnout in
nurses using the MBI were collected from 1994 to 2022. All those
studies that had used one of the other versions of the scale were
excluded;studiesthatdidnotreportmeanandstandarddeviations,
but other indices related to burnout, such as correlations, positive
case rate, and prevalence were also excluded. To ensure that
no relevant articles were missed, the researchers of this study
independentlysearchedthereferencelistsoftheincludedstudies.
/two.tnum./two.tnum./three.tnum. Study selection process and eligibility
criteria
PRISMA was used to select the relevant studies. The words
“Maslach Burnout Inventory” and nurse were searched. A total
of 843 results were produced, of which 105 were produced in
2020, 140 in 2021, and 127 in 2022, while in previous years,

The review included 19 studies that examined 27 samples,
comprising 59,111 nurses belonging to departments of Primary
Care,Community,GeneralHospital,MentalHospital,Emergency,
HIV Clinical Care, Community Mental Health, Hospital Units,
Oncology, Adult General Hospital, and Medical and Primary
Healthcare. Pre–COVID-19 burnout studies were mainly
conducted in Europe (eight nations), Asia (three nations), North
America (two nations), South America (one nation), and Oceania
(one nation). Among the 27 samples, the scores for the EE
dimension were classiﬁed as low in nine studies, moderate in
16 studies, and high in two studies. While the scores of the DP
dimension were classiﬁed as low in seven studies, moderate in 14

A comparison of means for independent samples was
performed with Student’s t-test comparison of means with 95%
conﬁdenceintervals.AfterBonferronicorrection, p-valuesof <0.01
can be considered statistically signiﬁcant ( Table3). Mean levels
of EE were 20.12 ±5.63 before COVID-19 and 23.79 ±6.44
during COVID-19. The DP mean was 8.56 ±4.03 before COVID-
19 and 8.00 ±3.15 during COVID-19. The PA mean was 30.23
±7.58 before COVID-19 and 26.51 ±7.36 during COVID-19.
Comparison of the averages measured did not report statistically
signiﬁcant results (see also the simple boxplot comparing means
in Supplementary material). From a qualitative point of view,
however, an increase in EE and a decrease in PA are appreciated.

/four.tnum. Discussion
/four.tnum./one.tnum. Aim of the present study
This comparative review aimed to examine burnout levels
among nurses by comparing the average scores of nurses
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make the
results comparable, the main psychometric assessment tool for
burnout was selected for its main factorial components, suchas EE, DP, and PA. This comparison was made using a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of scores collected from a
large number of large samples of health professionals over a
period of more than 20 years. To make these data comparable,
they were further processed and classiﬁed according to risk
level: low, moderate, and high ( 3). Surprisingly, the comparison
of the measured average values did not yield statistically
signiﬁcant results. Quantitative ﬁndings show that the burnout
levels of the nurses were similar before and during the
COVID-19 pandemic, whereas qualitative ﬁndings show that
nurses reported higher levels of EE and lower levels of PA
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of burnout
levels across the emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization

(DP), and personal accomplishment (PA) dimensions diﬀered
between the two periods. Before COVID-19, the majority of
studies reported moderate scores for EE and DP, with fewer
studies reporting high scores. However, during COVID-19, there
was an increase in the number of studies reporting high
scores for EE and DP. Additionally, during COVID-19, more
studies reported low scores for PA compared with the period
beforeCOVID-19./four.tnum./two.tnum. Burnout levels among nurses before
the pandemic
High and moderate levels of EE and DP and low levels of
PA were already prevalent in the population of nurses in several
countries around the world before the pandemic ( 53,54). From
a theoretical perspective, this ﬁnding is consistent with Gee et al.
(55) who found that the nursing workforce was already at risk

of burnout in previous years. A recent meta-analysis by Ge
et al. (56)—including 94 studies covering over 30 countries—
revealed that the global prevalence of nursing burnout syndrome
over the past 10 years (from 2012 to 2022) was 30.0%, with
signiﬁcant heterogeneity inﬂuenced by specialty, region, and
year. The prevalence tended to gradually increase during the
COVID-19 pandemic, with more signiﬁcant increases observed
in Europe and Africa. Diﬀerences in sample size and research
scope may account for the discrepancy. Factors contributing to
burnout include adverse working conditions such as workload,
rotating shifts, low salaries, workplace violence, and a lack
ofsupport.
/four.tnum./three.tnum. Burnout levels among nurses during
the pandemic
During the pandemic, a large percentage of frontline workers
had low levels of burnout and a sense of personal satisfaction,
also due to role changes from primary and community nurses to
frontline workers dealing with patients suﬀering from COVID-19
(57–59). A study by Dewi et al. ( 60) found that nurse burnout in
Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic was inﬂuenced by various
factors. Psychological factors such as worry and psychological
distress were already signiﬁcant predictors of burnout ( 61), while
the COVID-19 outbreak has worsened the mental health of
healthcare workers, impacting their performance. Religious beliefs
and supportive spiritual aspects are important for the mental
wellbeing of healthcare workers. Work-related factors such as
workload, overtime jobs, and job stress contribute signiﬁcantly to
burnout.StressinsurgicalwardsandICUsisparticularlyassociated
with burnout among nurses. Insuﬃcient resources and a lack of
personal protective equipment (PPE) are additional predictors ofstress and burnout. Nurse-patient relationships also play a role
in burnout in the form of abuse from patients and emotional
situationswiththepublic.
/four.tnum./four.tnum. Diﬀerences among countries
According to Toscano et al. ( 62), several studies have
highlighted the prevalence of burnout syndrome (BOS) among
nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, taking into account
diﬀerences among countries. In Belgium, 68% of participating
ICU nurses showed BOS symptoms, with emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization,andreducedpersonalaccomplishmentreported.
A Canadian study found moderate-to-high burnout in all nurses,
with signs of secondary traumatic stress and intentions to
quit. Israeli nurses reported high levels of burnout, which
signiﬁcantlyaﬀectedprofessionalfunctioning.TurkishICUnurses
demonstrated a positive correlation between burnout and fear
of COVID-19. South African nurses experienced moderate-to-
high burnout levels, while Iranian ICU nurses showed emotional
exhaustion and depersonalization. Italian nurses exhibited BOS
symptoms, with emotional exhaustion being the most prevalent.
These ﬁndings indicate a relevant risk of BOS among ICU nurses
duringthepandemic.
In the present study, before COVID-19, studies were more
evenly distributed across diﬀerent continents, with studies
conducted in Europe (eight nations), Asia (three nations), North
America (two nations), South America (one nation), and Oceania
(one nation). During COVID-19, the majority of studies were
conducted in Asia (four nations), followed by Europe (three
nations) and North America (one nation). The comparison
indicates that during the pandemic, there was a notable increase
in burnout levels among nurses in Asian countries, with more

/four.tnum./five.tnum. Limitations
Thestudyalsohassomelimitations.Ininterpretingtheresults,
it is necessary to take into account the diﬀerences (e.g., healthcare
systems, working hours, and work–life balance) in terms of the
countries in which the studies were conducted and the year
of their publication. Regarding possible publication bias, it is
necessary to consider the possible bias of the studies included in
the study, a factor that was attempted to be controlled by critical
reading of the studies before their inclusion. A standard meta-
analytic methodology was not used due to a lack of statistical
parameters, yet it could be well performed if the amount of
research data allowed it. Because the articles reviewed were
descriptive studies, the level of evidence from the studies is low,
but it is suﬃcient to analyze means, standard deviations, and
percentages and to relate the variables and their integration in a
comparative review such as the one conducted here. Furthermore,
the comparison of burnout between the two groups might
be aﬀected by diﬀerences in sample size. The group with a
larger sample size (before COVID-19) will likely have higher
statistical power to detect smaller eﬀects, while the group with
a smaller sample size (during COVID-19) may have reduced
statistical power to detect signiﬁcant diﬀerences. Finally, it would
have been ideal to compare the same subjects under diﬀerent
conditions, but unfortunately, there are no longitudinal studies on
burnoutlevels.
/five.tnum. Conclusion
The present study has shown that burnout is already a
silent epidemic that is certainly exacerbated by COVID-19.
However, considering the literature data, COVID-19 can only
explain a portion of the burnout levels among nurses. The
literature accurately shows how these healthcare professionals had
already been in a precarious situation for years ( 61). Addressingburnoutamongnursesshouldremainatoppriority.Implementing
comprehensive support systems, enhancing work–life balance,
and fostering a positive work environment can help mitigate
burnout risk ( 62). Longitudinal studies should investigate the
lasting eﬀects of the pandemic on nurse burnout. Tailored
interventions, training programs, and mental health resources
can aid nurses in coping with the challenges they face ( 63–65).
Continuous monitoring and preventive strategies are essential
to safeguarding the wellbeing of healthcare professionals ( 66–
71).
