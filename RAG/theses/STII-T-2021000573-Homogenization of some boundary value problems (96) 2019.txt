Abstract

Homogenization of Some Boundary Value Problems
in Perforated Domains

Jake M. Avila Adviser:
University of the Philippines, Diliman Bituin C. Cabarrubias, Ph.D.
June 2019

This work deals with the asymptotic behavior of some boundary value problems
posed in perforated domains of R. In the first one, we consider a linear parabolic
problem in a periodically perforated domain with nonlinear-Robin boundary condition
on the inner boundary while a Dirichlet condition is imposed on the outer boundary.
Second, we consider the case with “small holes” as described in [15] and deal with
an elliptic problem with nonhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition imposed on
the holes. Another problem in small holes, this case as described in [21], we consider
8 quasilinear problem with a nonlinear Robin boundary condition on some holes
while a Dirichlet condition is prescribed on the other holes as well as on the outer
boundary. We apply an appropriate extension of the Periodic Unfolding Method for
the homogenization of each problem.

Introduction

The theory of homogenization became a spotlight in applied mathematics ever since
the discovery of composite materials. The goal of homogenization is to describe the
macroscopic behavior of a material by taking into account its microscopic properties.
That is, it tries to generalize the behavior of a heterogeneous material when it is
viewed as a homogeneous one.

Composite materials are basically a fine mixture of two or more individual homo-
geneous constituents with slightly different properties, which in turn can produce a
new material with a completely different property. Some composites play an active
role in the industry since it offer a stronger, lighter, and a less expensive alternative to
usual raw materials. Examples of composite materials are concrete, fibre-reinforced
polymers, high strain composites, sandwich-structured composites, carbon compos-
ites used as a shielding agent in the launch and re-entry phase of spacecrafts, super-
conducting multifilamentary composites used in optical fibres, kevlar for bullet-proof
vests, and implants for orthopedic surgery. The applications are astounding as com-
posites in the form of fibreglass are widely-used in the production of sports equipment
for baseball, racing and hockey.

In essence, we can model certain processes using partial differential equations such
as in infiltration [3], thermal diffusion [3], thermal conductivity [4], chemical reactions
[23], and climatization problems [43]. Using the information obtained from the limit
equation, we can now describe what is happening in the system with the consideration
of the interaction among the individual components present.

Several methods in homogenization have been developed; for instance for the
non-periodic case, we have the G-convergence [41], H-convergence [36], and the I-
convergence [33]. For the periodic case, we have Tartar’s method of oscillating test
functions [42], multiple-scale method [5], two-scale convergence [37], and the periodic
unfolding method [13].

In this work, we utilize the periodic unfolding method, as it involves a more el-
ementary approach since it only deals with convergences in L?-spaces. Also, the
two-scale convergence of a sequence of functions in L?(2) is equivalent to a weak

Chapter 1. Introduction 2

convergence of the unfolded functions in L?(Q x Y). Here, any function in the perfo-
rated domain is mapped to the unfolded function in a fixed domain. Furthermore, we
do not need any extension operators for problems with nonhomogeneous boundary
conditions due to the boundary unfolding operator.

In this thesis, we aim to describe the asymptotic behaviors of some boundary
value problems posed in perforated domains. We want to see what different types
of boundary value problems posed in different geometries of domains with different
boundary conditions yield once an appropriate extension of the periodic unfolding
method is used. Also, in the latter part, we aim to discuss how these contributions
arise, how the sizes of the holes matter in the limit problem, and how the boundary
conditions behave in these settings.

For the first two problems, we consider domains with holes that are distributed
e-periodically whose size r(e) satisfies r(¢)/e + 0. Throughout the thesis, we call
such as “small” holes. For the first problem, we consider domains with one hole in
each period with size «5 where 6 = 6(€) where 5 > 0 as € — 0. For the second one,
we consider two holes in each period each with sizes €6, and ed) where 6; = 6;(€) and
62 = 52(€) whenever ¢ — 0. For the last problem, we consider a perforated domain
whose holes have sizes the same as its period.

Asymptotic behaviors of problems with Robin or Neumann boundary conditions
posed in perforated domains via periodic unfolding method were done in the works
[18], [19] and [17]. While in “small” holes, applications to sieve-type problems can
be found in [15]. We mention here that the unfolding operator for “small” holes first
appeared in [10] as a change of variable and a corresponding boundary layer operator
was introduced in (15).

In the literature, a homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the Poisson equation in
perforated domains was studied in [20] with holes of size e* where k > 0. Here it was
shown that the size e*/("-2) is critical in a sense that the limit problem contains an
additional zero-order term, called the “strange” term which depends on the capacity
of the set of holes in the limit. Also, in [24] the authors considered a non homogeneous
Neumann problem for the Laplacian but with critical size is of order e"/(-)) and the
contribution of the holes in the limit is again given by an additional term in limit
problem. The problem in (24] was treated in [38] via unfolding. Furthermore, for
mixed-type boundary conditions on the holes, we refer the reader to [9] and [82]. It is
important to note that in both papers, the strange term contribution appears again

Chapter 1. Introduction 3

in the limit problem as well as the critical sizes.
‘We consider first a linear elliptic problem posed in a domain with small holes

given by the system

—div (A*(z)Vus(z)) = f(z) in xs,
AF (z)Viues(2) « Mes = ge(x) on OBE, (1.1)
ues(z) = 0 on 85 \ OBE,

where a nonhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition is imposed on the holes. Note
that some homogenization results for this problem were done in [38] but was obtained
by considering a test function usually used in perforated domains. In our case we will
use 8 test function introduced in [15] that are particularly suited for domain with
small holes. Here, our goal is to recover and to refine the previous results in [38].

The second one we deal with is a quasilinear elliptic problem posed in a domain
with two small holes given by the system

div (A°(2, ¥e5,6,)V Ue s2) = f(z) in Q46835
Ueds5. = 0 on 4%, 5, UOBS, (1.2)
AS (2, the6s6q)V Uessba * Moby + €77e(2)A(Uesss,) = e(t) on OT?.

In this problem, we impose a nonlinear Robin boundary condition on some holes
while a Dirichlet condition is prescribed on the other holes as well as on the outer
boundary. Along with difficulties pointed out in the previous problem, the presence
of both nonlinearities in the coefficient matrix and the boundary condition poses a
big problem. First, we need to prove some convergences on the boundary which is
based on the weak continuity of the Nemytskii operator associated to h. In order to
do so, we need several preliminary results on the properties of h. Another difficulty is
the passing to the limit in the quasilinear matrix as one needs to prove by definition.

Some known results related to this problem considered a linear problem with
nonhomogeneous Neumann condition prescribed on some holes and a homogeneous
Dirichlet condition on the other holes along with the outer boundary [21], a perforated
domain setting of the problem was dealt in [7], and a linear Robin problem in two
small holes was shown in [39].

Lastly, we have a linear parabolic problem posed in a periodically perforated

domain given by the system

u,(z, t) — div (A°(z)Vu-(z, t)) = f(x, t) in Q2 x [0,7],

u-(z,t)=0 on (O03 \ OS.) x {0,T], (13)
A®(x)Vue(z, t) me + €77e(z)h(te) = ge(z,t) on OS, x [0,T],

ue(x, 0) = u2(x) in Qf.

Here, u’(z,t) is the derivative with respect to the variable t and we prescribe a
nonlinear-Robin boundary condition on the inner boundary while a Dirichlet con-
dition is imposed on the outer boundary. We start by considering an e-fixed problem
and show that a solution exists, it is unique, and it satisfies an a priori estimate. We
do this using the Faedo-Galerkin method as in [1] and [2]. We note that there is a
difficulty arising in showing the estimates for the solution of the approximate problem
due to the nonlinear Robin condition as it needs another estimate for the function
h. Another difficulty appears in the homogenization due to the presence of the term
£7 because the behavior of the limit functions depends on the value of 7. Another
point of difficulty is the treatment of the term h along the boundary of the holes. In
order to pass to the limit, we need some preliminary results on the convergence of
the unfolding of h.

In the literature, some related known results were shown for the quasilinear case
with nonhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition in [1], using the Faedo-Galerkin
method to show well-posedness in the heat equation (see also [2]), the treatment of
the Robin term A(v) in [19] and [7], and using the periodic unfolding method in the
homogenization of the heat equation in perforated domains in [31] (see also [29]).

This thesis contains seven chapters. In Chapter 2, we give a background that will
be necessary to understand and to prove the main results of this work. This includes
some well-known definitions and theorems in L?-spaces, Hilbert spaces, distributions,
Sobolev spaces and some well-posedness theorems. Chapter 3 gives a short discussion
on the periodic unfolding method including some of the several extensions of this
tool, done in the literature, that we need. Chapter 4 deals with homogenization of
the linear elliptic problem given in (1.1) which was introduced in [38]. Chapter 5
works on with the asymptotic behavior of the quasilinear elliptic problem given in
(1.2) while Chapter 6 concerns the well-posedness and homogenization of the linear
parabolic problem given in (1.3). Lastly, we provide a comprehensive summary and
a brief discussion of the main results of the thesis in Chapter 7.

Chapter 2

Preliminaries

In this chapter, we introduce the convergences in Banach and L?-spaces, and enu-
merate basic properties of some classes of Sobolev spaces as explained in [16] that are
sufficient and necessary to prove the main results in this paper.

2.1 Banach spaces

Definition 2.1 A set V is called a vector space over R with the two operations
+:VxVHVand-:RxVHYV, if for all J, € R and z,y,z € V, the following
are satisfied:

(@) c+y=y+a,

(i) (c+y)+z=2+(yt+2z),

(iii) 36 € V such that 7+ 6 =z,

(iv) r+ (-z) = 8,

The space V together with its norm denoted by ||z||v is called a normed space.

Definition 2.3 A subset E of a normed space V is said to be dense in V if each

x € V is the limit of a sequence in E.

Definition 2.4 A sequence {z,} in a normed space V is called a Cauchy sequence if
lim, [ltm — tally = 0.

Definition 2.5 A normed space V is said to be complete if for every Cauchy sequence
{zn} in V, there exists an x € V such that {z,} converges to z. Moreover, a complete
normed space is called a Banach space.

Definition 2.6 Let V be a vector space. A mapping

is called a scalar product if the following are satisfied:
(i) (z,z)v > 0 if and only if c 4 0.
(ii) For all A, € R and all z,y,z EV,

a. (t,y)v = (y,2)v,
b. (Az+ my, 2z)v = A(z, 2)v + u(y, 2)v-

Moreover, if V is a Banach space with respect to the norm

llzllv = y(z,2)v,

then V is called a Hilbert space.

2.1.1 The space C(E, F)

In this section, we let E and F be Banach spaces equipped with the norms || - ||z and
| Ilr, respectively.

Definition 2.7 A mapping y: E'++ F is linear if

Definition 2.8 A mapping y: E+ F is bounded if

that is,
lle(z)lle < [llizlle,

for some A € R, and all x € E.

Definition 2.9 The space C(E, F) denotes the set of all linear and bounded maps
from E to F.

Then the following are equivalent:

Definition 2.11 The set of all linear and continuous maps from E to R is called the
dual space of E denoted by E’. Also, the dual of the dual space of E and is denoted
by E” is called the bidual of E. Moreover, if x’ € E’, then we denote by

(2',2) eB,
the image x(x) of z € E.
Remark 2.12 The dual space E’ = £(E,R).
Definition 2.13 Let F : E++ E” be the canonical injection map. Then E is said to

be reflerive if F is surjective.

2.1.2 Weak and weak* convergences
Definition 2.14 A sequence {z,} in E is said to converge weakly to x € E, denoted

quence in E. Then there exists a subsequence {rn,} of {tn} and x € E such that as
k- 0,

Zn, > Z weakly in E,

and if tn, — x weakly in E for allk € N, then
Zp, — x weakly in E.
Theorem 2.17 Let {zn} C E and {yn} C E’ such that

In—>=z weakly in E,
Yn y — strongly in E’.

Then,
lim (Yn, Zn) ee = (2, y)erE-

2.1.4 Boundary Value Problems and Periodicity

In this section, we introduce the class of functions that 1we will consider in our main
problem. We will also define some sequence of matrices and the conditions necessary
for a boundary value problem.

Definition 2.27 The interval Y in R% defined by
Y=], &[x]O, [x --+ x]O, év[,
where ¢; > 0 for any i € {1,2,..., N}, is called the reference period.

Definition 2.28 Let Y be a reference period, and f be a function defined a.e. in
R". Then, f is said to be Y-periodic if

f(c+ké&e) = f(z),

ae. in RN for all k € Z and any i € {1,2,...,N}, where {e:,¢2,...,ew} is the
canonical basis of R.

Chapter 2. Preliminaries 11

We now introduce some operators that we will encounter in the next chapters.

Definition 2.29 Let 2 be a bounded open set of R" and f € L(Q). The mean
value of f over Q is the real number Mo(f) given by

MoS) = Fay J, Sav

Definition 2.30 Let a,8 € R such that 0 < a < f. We denote by M(a,§,2) the
set of all N x N matrices

A= (ay)icigen € (L°(Q)*
that satisfy the inequalities:

{ (A(z), A) > aap,
(A(2)Al < BIA,

for any \€ R™ and ae. on 2.
Moreover, we define the operator

N
~div(A(z)¥) = - (auterge-).

ij=l
We end this section by giving necessary conditions for a given boundary value
problem to be well-posed.

Definition 2.31 Let P be a boundary value problem and E and F be Banach spaces.
Then P is said to be well-posed with respect to E and F if the following are satisfied:

(i) For any f € F, there exists a solution u € E of P.
(it) The solution u is unique.

(itt) The mapping f € F + u€ E is continuous, that is, the solution depends on
the data continuously.
2.2 Sobolev spaces

In this section, we introduce some classes of Sobolev spaces where we will establish
certain convergences in the homogenization results.

Chapter 2. Preliminaries 12

2.2.1 D(Q) and Distributions
Definition 2.32 Let yp: 2++ R. The support of y, denoted by supp 9, is defined as
supp ¢ = {x € N(x) # 0}.

Definition 2.33 We denote by D() the set of indefinitely differentiable functions
whose support is a compact set of R contained in 2.

Theorem 2.34 The space D(Q) is dense in L?(Q) for 1 < p< oo.

Definition 2.35 A map T : D(Q) — R is called a distribution in Q if T is linear and

continuous on sequences.

Remark 2.36 D/(Q) denotes the set of distributions in Q, and it is also the dual
space of D(Q).

Definition 2.37 Let T € D’(Q). For any i € {1,2,...,.N}, the derivative in the
sense of distributions of T with respect to 2; is defined by

oT a
(52°) moon “(86 noe
* ‘D(N),D(Q) Ti 1 D(n),D(A)

for any y € D(M).

2.2.2 The spaces W!? and H!
Let us now have the definition of the Sobolev space.

Definition 2.38 Let p > 1. The Sobolev space W1?(2) is defined by

lu € LP(2) and & ¢ 1m0) fori € {0,2,....8}},

w)?(Q) = {«

where the derivatives are taken in the sense of distributions. Moreover, for p = 2, we
denote the space W1?() to be H1(Q).

Theorem 2.39 The space W1?(Q) is a Banach space equipped with the norm

Theorem 2.40 The space H1({) is a Hilbert space for the scalar product
Ov dw
(v, w) aa) = (0, w)zaQn) + > (%. Bee’
for any v,w € H}(Q).
Let us now have the technical definition of a boundary being Lipschitz continuous.

Definition 2.41 The boundary 62 is Lipschitz continuous if there exist c,,c, > 0
and a finite number M of local coordinate systems (=, ry) and local maps ®,,, for
m € {1,2,..., M} defined on the set

Rm = {E" = (27,09, .--,2%-1) ERY ||2"| < cy for i=1,2,...,N-1}
which are Lipschitz continuous on their domain of definition, such that

M
o2= UTm,
where, for any m = 1,2,...,M, ™
Tn = {(@", cH)” € Rn and ry = ®,,(F")}
with the sets
Om = {(E,2R)IE™ € Rm and Bma(Z™) < 2% < Bm(Z") +n} CM
Cm = {(E",2%)|E™ € Rey and Gon(Z") — 09 < 22 < Gq(Z™)} CRYO.
Moreover, D(®) denotes the set of restrictions in 1 of functions in D(RY).

will be frequently used in the next chapters.

2.3 Some Well-posedness Theorems

This section deals with some fixed-point theorems used in showing the existence and

uniqueness results for elliptic and parabolic boundary value problems.

2.3.1 Lax-Milgram Theorem
Here, we let V be a Banach space and H be a Hilbert space.
Definition 2.64 A mapping a: V x V+ R isa bilinear form on V if for any fixed
u € V, the following maps are linear:
a(u,-):v €Vr+a(u,v) ER,
a(-,u):vE€Vrsva(v,u) ER.
Definition 2.65 A mapping a: V x V + R is bounded if there exists C > 0 such

that for any u,v EV,
la(u, v)| < Cllullvllelly.

Theorem 2.66 Leta: V x V ++ R be a bilinear form. Then a is continuous on
V x V if and only if a is bounded.
Definition 2.67 A mapping a: V x V + R is V-elliptic with constant ao if there
exists Qo > 0 such that for any ue V,

a(u, u) > aollullt,.
Definition 2.68 Let a be a bilinear form on H and F € H’. The problem given by

Find u € H such that
a(u,v) = (Fun (2.1)
Wu € H,

is called a variational equation, with v € H called a test function.

Theorem 2.69 (Riesz Representation Theorem) Let F € H’. Then there ex-
ists a unique TF € H such that

(Fo) aH = (TF, e) x,
for any v € H. Moreover, the injection
T:FEH 4+rFeEH

satisfies

IrF lla = [Fil

Chapter 2. Preliminaries 7

The next theorem gives the well-posedness of a linear elliptic problem.

Theorem 2.70 (Lax-Milgram) Let a be a continuous bilinear form on H and
F € H’. Assume that a is H-elliptic with constant ao. Then, (2.1) admits a unique
solution u € H that satisfies

Nlullir < a7 Fler.

2.3.2 Schauder’s Fixed Point Theorem

Next, for quasilinear elliptic problems we use the following fixed-point theorem to
show existence as in [6] (see also [12]); while the uniqueness part follows from the
arguments in [39].

Theorem 2.71 (Schauder’s Fixed Point, [44]) Let K be a closed convex set ina
Banach space X. Let T be a continuous function from K to K such that T(K) is
relatively compact. Then T has a fized point in K.

2.3.3 Faedo-Galerkin Method

To end this section, we have the following method used in parabolic problems. Here,
we outline the general idea of the Faedo-Galerkin method.

1. Since Hi(Q) can be approximated by a sequence of finite-dimensional subspaces
say {E,}, we start by constructing these subspaces and introduce the projection
operator. Also, we formulate an approximate problem for each n and show that

it has a unique solution u, € W.
2. Show that u,, satisfies an a priori estimate
3. Pass to the limit as n -> oo and show that u, converges to a solution u of (6.8).

4. Show that u is bounded and unique.

Periodic Unfolding Method

The periodic unfolding method started in the setting of fixed domains as in [14] (for
more details, see see [25] and (26]). The extension of the operator to perforated do-
mains was done in [18] which include time-dependent functions [31], and for domains
with small holes [15] and for domains with two small holes [39]. For the extension in
small holes to time-dependent functions, see [8].

Now, we recall some of the extensions of this method that we need in this work
(see [18], [31], [15], and [39], respectively). Here, we enumerate some properties and

their implications.

3.1 General notation

In this section, we introduce the general notations used in [14]. Let 2 be a bounded
open subset of R such that |O0| = 0, and define the reference cell Y =]0,1[" with
respect to a basis (by, b2,...,by) defining the periods in RY.
Define the set
E. = {€€ Z%e(¥ +6) c 0},

and denote the largest union of cells e(Y + €) that lies inside 2 by
A.=ine{ U &(¥ +6),

ee=,
and set A, = 2\G, which is the subset of © containing parts from the cells e(Y + €)
that intersect its boundary (see Figure 3.1).

Let z € RY. Denote the unique integer combination of periods by [z]y = CJL, kjbj =

€(k) such that z —[z]y € Y and set {z}y = z—[z]y. Thus, we can decompose z into
its corresponding fractional part {z}y and integer part [z]y (see Figure 3.2). Then

for each z € R¥, one has

one((E], +{Z},) a0 ia".

3.2 Unfolding operator for fixed domains

In this section, we recall the basic properties of the unfolding operator for fixed
domains as introduced in [14] written for |Y| = 1 (for more details, see (25] and [26]).

Then,

T.(we) > w weakly in L?(0; W'9(Y)).
Also, there exists @ € L?(Q;W,2(Y)) such that up to a subsequence,

T.(Vuwe) > Vw + Vyid weakly in LP(Q x Y).

3.3 Unfolding operator in perforated domains

In this section, we recall the basic properties of the unfolding operator in perforated
domains as introduced in [18].

Geometric Setting

Let 2 be a bounded open subset of R% such that |9| = 0 and consider the reference
cell Y =]0,1[% with respect to a basis defining periods in R'. Let S be a compact
subset of Y with a Lipschitz continuous boundary. Thus, the part occupied by the
material in cell Y is Y* = Y \ S, in which we suppose is connected (see Figure 3.3).

The perforated domain 22; (see Figure 3.4) is then obtained by removing from 2 the
set of holes S,, where

S = U e€+5).

€eZzZN
Also, define
9 =A,\S,, and At =08\ A.

Chapter 3. Periodic Unfolding Method 22

Figure 3.3: The cell Y* and the set S.

Figure 3.4: The domain 2,.

Furthermore, we denote by 09, the boundary of 22.
Let us now introduce the operator.

Definition 3.6 (Unfolding Operator, [18]) Let y be a Lebesgue-measurable func-
tion in Q, the unfolding operator 7, is defined as follows:

= 6 .
TleNey = | 9 (c zl, +e) , ae. for (z.y)EN, x Y*,
0, a.e. for (x,y) € Ae x Y*.

Remark 3.7 All properties mentioned in Section 3.2 still holds for this unfolding

operator as given in [18]. Moreover, an unfolding criterion is still satisfied.

For the terms in the boundary of the perforations, we introduce a suitable unfold-

ing operator.

Chapter 3. Periodic Unfolding Method 23
Definition 3.8 (Boundary Unfolding Operator, [18]) Let y be a Lebesgue-measurable

function on an: 1 @S,, the boundary unfolding operator 7? is defined as follows:

Te\(2.y) = | 9g G [zl +ev{=} ) , ae. for (x,y) € % x aS,
. we 0, a.e. for (x,y) € Ae x OS.

We also have the following properties for this operator.
Theorem 3.9 ([18]) Let p € [1,+00[, yp € L'(05,), and v,w € L?(S,). Then,
(i) T2(ww)(2, y) = T2()(2,y) Te (w)(2,9)-
(it) Te is linear.

(iv) Let ¢ € L?(OS) be a Y-periodic function and set p, = v(2). Then,
Te (e)(x,y) = ly)

(v) For w € L?(8S),

Te(w) + w strongly in L?(O x OS).

(vi) Let g € L?(8S) be Y-periodic and set
9(2) if Mos(g) =0,
9e(z) =
eg(2) if Mos(g) #0.
Then for p € D(Q), one has

125 sys( of pdr, where Mas(9) doz.

Theorem 3.10 ([18]) Let p € [1,+00|. Let {w.} be a sequence in W1?(Q,) such
that

lim las, 8? do, =

Te (we) > w weakly in L7(2;W*(Y)),
then
Te(we) = w weakly in L?(0; W1-5”(Q8)).

Now, we extend the unfolding operator in perforated domains suited for time
dependent functions. Here, we only state the theorems as the proofs are similar as
given in [18], one just needs to integrate over [0,7] to obtain the results.

Chapter 3. Periodic Unfolding Method 24

3.4 Time-dependent unfolding operator in perfo-
rated domains

Before we introduce the time-dependent operator for perforated domains, let us first
have the analog for fixed domains. Here, we state the theorems from [31] (for more
details, see [30}).

3.5 Unfolding operator in domains with small holes

In this section, we introduce two unfolding operators that depend on two and three
parameters, respectively.

Chapter 3. Periodic Unfolding Method 26

3.5.1 Unfolding operator in domains depending on two pa-

rameters

In this section, we introduce an extension of the unfolding operator that suits the
geometry of a perforated domain with holes of sizes depending on two parameters.
This operator was first introduced in [10] and was used in reticulated structures
[11] and sieve problems [15]. Furthermore, we enumerate basic properties and esti-
mates (as mentioned in [15]) that will be useful in the homogenization results later.
In the sequel, the Sobolev exponent for N > 3 corresponding to 2 is given by
2N

w= (3.1)

General Notations

Let N > 3. Let Q and Y be sets as defined in Section 3.3. Let B be an open subset
of Y with a Lipschitz continuous boundary and 6 a small parameter going to zero.
The rescaled set 5B will then be referred to as the hole in Y. Thus, the part occupied
by the material in cell Y is ¥; = Y \ 5B, in which we will suppose to be connected
(see Figure 3.5).

Figure 3.5: The cell Ys; and the set B.

The perforated domain 2, is then obtained by removing from 2 the set of holes
BS (see Figure 3.6), where
Bi= U e(€+ 6B).

gezN
Furthermore, we denote by 42,5 the boundary of 2.5.

Finally, we suppose that the size €6 of the holes in 2 are smaller than the period,
and so is tending to zero quicker than € as € approaches zero. That is, we are in the
case of small holes as described in [20] (see also [15] and [24]).

Chapter 3. Periodic Unfolding Method 27

Figure 3.6: The domain 2.5.

Let us now introduce the operator.

Definition 3.16 (Unfolding Operator, [15]) Let p € [1,+0o[. For p € L*(Q),
the unfolding operator
Tes: LP(2) 4 L(A RY),
is given by il
Te az, Oz) if (x,z) € Ox <Y,

otherwise.

We also introduce the local average of a function.

Definition 3.17 (Local Average, [21]) Let p € [1,+00[. For ¢ € L?(Q), the local
average Mj, : L?(9) ++ L?(Q) is given by

E(y) =
¥(¥) = [T) dy.
Theorem 3.18 ((21]) Jf {v-} is a bounded sequence in L?(2) such that
Ue vu — strongly in L?(Q),

then
My(v,-) + v strongly in L?(Q).

Let us have the following properties of this unfolding operator.

Chapter 3. Periodic Unfolding Method 28

(i) For any v,w € L7(2),
Tes(vw) = Tes(v)Tes(w).

Tes(Veu) = =5V2(Tes(u)), in 2 x FY.

(vi) Suppose N > 3 and let w C RN be open and bounded. The following estimates
hold:

where C is the Sobolev-Poincaré-Wirtinger constant for H*(Y).

(vii) Suppose N > 3 and let {wes} be a sequence in H*(Q) which is uniformly
bounded as both « and 6 approach zero. Then there exists W € L?(Q; L?*(R™))
with V.W € L?(2 x RY) such that up to a subsequence,

-1
a (Tes(wes) — ME(wes)1yy) > W weakly in L?(0; L™*(R%)),
and ya
u = V=(Tes(wes)) yy + VeW weakly in 1(0 x RY).
Furthermore, if

then one can choose the subsequence and some U € L2,,(9; L?*(R%)) such that
x

-1
aa Tea(wes) =U weakly in 12,,(0; L*(R™)),

where 2° is given in (3.1).
Also, an unfolding criterion for integrals holds for this extension operator.

Theorem 3.23 ((38]) Let {we} be a sequence in H'(Q,5) such that ||wellir(n,4) #8
bounded. Then, there exists w € H1(Q) such that

Tes(we) + w weakly in L?(2; Hi,(Y)).
Also, there exists © € L?(Q; H}.,(Y)) such that up to a subsequence,

Tes(Ve) + Vw t+ Vy weakly in L7(9; L2,(Y))%.

Chapter 3. Periodic Unfolding Method 30

From here, we define a linear boundary operator on the boundary of the holes
BE specific to the case of domains with volume-distributed holes. Moreover, we
enumerate basic properties that are analogous to that of the boundary unfolding
operator mentioned in [21] and [38], whose derivations are based only on a change of
variable.

Definition 3.24 (Boundary Unfolding Operator, [21]) For y € L?(@B8), the
boundary unfolding operator

Te, : L?(OB®) ++ LP(R™ x 8B),
is defined by
T3(e)(z, z) =p (c [ZI +62) , Vee R,Vz € OB.
We have the following properties of this operator.
Theorem 3.25 ([15]) Let v,w € L?(OB8). Then,
Tes(vw)(2, 2) = T3(v) (a, 2) T33(w)(z, 2).

3.5.2 Unfolding operator in domains depending on three pa-

Let us now have the version of the unfolding operator that suits the geometry of a
perforated domain with holes of sizes depending on three parameters. The extension
of the periodic unfolding method in three parameters in [39] utilizes the fact that the
solution t,s,5, vanishes on the boundary of the perforated domain (see [39]). Also,
we note that the domain 2,5, is just the domain 2,5 with 6 replaced by 62.

Notations

Let 2 and Y be sets as defined in Section 3.3. Let B and T be compact disjoint subsets
of Y with Lipschitz continuous boundaries. Let 5; and 62 be small parameters going
to zero independently. The rescaled sets 5, B and 52T will be referred to as the holes
in Y. Thus, the part occupied by the material in cell Y is ¥s,¢, = Y \ (i: BU 8:7), in
which we will suppose to be connected (see Figure 3.7).

Figure 3.7: The cell Y5,5, and the sets B and T.

The perforated domain 6,5, is obtained by removing from 22 the set of holes BS
and T° (see Figure 3.8), where

Bi = (J e€+6B) and T= LU e(€ +67).

Chapter 3. Periodic Unfolding Method 32

Furthermore, we denote by 085,51 the exterior boundary of Q.5,5,-

Figure 3.8: The domain Q,6,5,-

Finally, we suppose that the sizes €4, and ed: of the holes in 2 are smaller than
the period, and so are tending to zero quicker than € as € approaches zero. That is,
we are in the case of small holes as described in [20] (see also [24]).

Let us now introduce the operator.
Definition 3.29 (Unfolding Operator, [39]) Let p € [1,+00|. For y € L”(Q.5,),
the unfolding operator 74,5, is the function Tcs,5, : L?(Q) ++ L?(Q x RY) defined by

GF az, bz if (x, z) € Aes, x 2Y5,,
Tennlo)(t,2) = e6, (P) (x, 612) (x, 2) € N25 x 5, Yb
otherwise,

where 7;s, is the operator in Definition 3.16 by taking 6 = 6, and where Ys, = Y \ dT.

Remark 3.30 ([39]) All properties mentioned in Section 3.5.1 for Jes are still true
for 7; 6,4, by replacing 5 by 6, and Y by Ys.

We also have the following analog of the boundary unfolding operator.

Definition 3.31 (Boundary Unfolding Operator, [39]) For y € L”(0T;), the
boundary unfolding operator is defined by

Te,5,(¢)(2, z= (c [Z], + <2) , Wee R’ ze aT.

Chapter 3. Periodic Unfolding Method 33

Remark 3.32 All properties mentioned in Section 3.5.1 for TZ are still true for 7,5,
by replacing 5 by 4).

Remark 3.33 Notice that 75,5, is just the operator 7;s,, and 7,55, is the operator
To, Indeed, this follows directly from Definitions 3.16 and 3.24 with 6 replaced by
6, and 42, respectively.

We now introduce the functional space from which we will get our test function
necessary for the treatment of the contribution of the small holes in our limit problem.

Definition 3.34 ([15]) Define the functional space
Kp = {py € L* (RY) | Vp € L7(R") and ¢ constant on B},
where 2° is given by (3.1).

Theorem 3.35 ([15]) Let v € D(RY)N Kg and set

‘Wes(z) = o(B) — ¢ {2}) , Vee RN.

Then,
wes > 0(B) weakly in H*(Q), (3.2)
and
1 al
Tes(Vwes) = -yV in DQ, x 5y (3.3)
Theorem 3.36 ([15]) Let N > 3. Then the set

Ut € Hyer(Y) |p = 0 on 5B},
0<b<.

is dense in H}.,(Y) for every by > 0.
Remark 3.37 From (3.2) we have,
wes > v(b) strongly in L?(Q),
so that by Theorem 3.3 (z),
Te(wes) + v(b) strongly in L?(9 x Y).
Remark 3.38 From the strong convergence in the previous remark, we have that
Tes(wes) > v(b) weakly in L?(9 x Y),
and so by Theorem 3.28,
Te(wes) + v(b) weakly in L?(9 x 8B).

Chapter 4

Linear Elliptic Problem

in Domains with Small Holes

In this section, we situate an elliptic problem considered in [38] in a periodically
perforated domain with holes of orders depending on two parameters as in Section
3.5.1 (see [15].) Here, we recover and refine the homogenization results in [38] in the
sense that the effect of the perforations is captured by using the test function given
in (15).

In particular, we consider the elliptic problem given by

—div (A*(z)Vues(z)) = f(z) in es,

A®(z)Vucs(z) + Mes = ge(z) on OB%, (4.1)

ues(z) = 0 on 8x5 \ OB?,
where we prescribe a nonlinear Neumann-type condition on the boundary of the holes
BS and a Dirichlet-type condition on the boundary of 2,5 that does not include the
boundary of the holes Bé. Here, n,s is the unit exterior normal vector to BS, and

A‘(a) = A (2) € M(a,6,9),
where M(a. 8,9) is given in Definition 2.30.
Some physical applications related to this problem involve the chemical reactions
happening on the wall of a reactor with periodically distributed grains as in the

Fruendlich kinetics model and the Langmuir kinetics model solved in [23].
We assume the following:

H1. f and g are functions such that

(i) fe LQ),
(ii) g € L?(OB).

H2. 6 = &(e) satisfies

Chapter 4. Linear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 35

Remark 4.1 The number ); corresponds to the critical size of Dirichlet small holes
from [20], while 2 corresponds to that of Neumann small holes from [24].

Introduce now the Banach space
Ves = {p € H*(Me5) | p = 0 on AN%qs \ BE},
equipped with the norm
llullyes = Vullzagney = Vu € Ves. (4.2)

In the sequel, we will still denote by y € Vs, its extension by zero in Bé and
again, we will assume that N > 3.

Remark 4.2 When f € V/; and g € H-4(9B) instead of the data assumptions in
#1, the results are still valid and the proofs are similar.

Remark 4.3 A Poincaré inequality holds in the space V.s. That is, there exists a
constant C > 0 such that

llullzaeacs) < Cll Villans), Yu € Ves. (4.3)
This, together with (5.3) gives the norm in Vs equivalent to that in H1(1,-s).

The variational formulation of (4.1) is given by:

Find u,s € Vis such that

G =
f Ae) Vso de = f fede + f 94 0M) (4.4)
for every v € V,s.

Indeed, let v € V,5 be a test function. Multiplying the first equation of (4.1) by uv
and integrating over Qs,

f _, raiv (ASV) ude = f __fode. (4.5)
Applying Green’s formula to the left-hand side of (5.6),

Chapter 4. Linear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 36
so that we obtain,

f div (AV) vde = f __ (A Vins) Vo de as)

Now, notice that by the boundary conditions in (5.1),

Thus, by (4.5) - (4.7),
fh A’ VuesVu de = fh. fodr+ f,,, gv doz,

from which (4.4) directly follows.

4.1 Homogenization results
We begin this section with the well-posedness of (4.4) due to Lax-Milgram Theorem.

Theorem 4.4 ([38]) Under assumptions H 1 and H 2, problem (4.4) admits a unique
solution ues € Ves satisfying the a priori estimate:

lluesllves < C, (4.8)
for some constant C > 0.

Let us now have the homogenization results. First, we obtain the unfolded limit
problem and convert to its corresponding strong formulation and end the section by
interpreting the contributions of each data at the limit. The next theorem will be
useful in the proof of our main result.

Chapter 4. Linear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 37

Theorem 4.5 ([38]) Let w. € H'(Qs) for every € with ||wella1(n,4) bounded. Then
there exist w € H*(2) and @ € L7(; He(Y)) such that

{ (i) Tw.) > w weakly in L?(O; H},(Y)), oo)

(it) Te(Vue) = Vwt+ Vy weakly in L?(0; L2,(Y))”.

Theorem 4.6 (Limit Problem) Suppose that, as € goes to zero, there exist a ma-
trit A such that

T.(A)(z,y) + A(z,y) a.e. nQx Y, (4.10)
and a matriz field Ay such that as € and 6 go to zero,
Tes(A)(z,z) 4+ Ao(z,z) ae. in Qx (RN \ B). (4.11)

Let ugs € Vis be the solution of (4.4), where « and 6 satisfy H2. Then up to a
subsequence, there exists up € H3(2) such that

Ug + Up strongly in L?(2). (4.12)

Also, there exist & € L?(9; Hi,(Y)) and U € L7(9;12,(IR™)) vanishing on 2 x B
with U — A,u9 in L7(Q; Kg) such that the ordered triple (uo, @, U) solves the following
limit equations:

{ A(z, y)(Vuo + Vyi)Vye(y) dy =0 ae. inQ and Vy € Hp.,(Y), (4.13)

foe Ao(z, z)V.UV.v(z)dz=0 ae. inQ and Wu € Kg with o(B) =0, (4.14)

= 4.15
J fede + r10B\Mon(s) [ waz, (4.18)
for ally € Hi(O),
where vg is the unit exterior normal to the set B and do, the surface measure.

Proof. We give the proof in several steps.

STEP 1. First, note that (4.12) is immediate from the estimate in (4.8) and that the
existence of @ € L7(0; H}.-(Y)) is guaranteed by Theorem 4.5.

Chapter 4. Linear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 38

On the other hand, the existence of U € L?(9; L2,,(R%)) such that U — Arup is

in L?(Q; Kg) follows from the arguments given in [15], so we omit the details of the
proof here.

Let us now proceed to the limit equations.
STEP 2. To show (4.13), let p € D(Q) and y € C},,(Y) be vanishing in a neighbor-
hood of the origin. So for ¢ and 6 small enough, one has U(.) = ew(-)y () € Ves.
Take © € V,5 as a test function in (4.4), and thus,
fh. A'VugsVV de = i fvar+ f,, a¥ doz.
By the gradient of W and the chain rule applied to y, we have

ef, A VussVuv (2 ) dr+ to A ae ) ae

Note that as € approaches zero, all integrals in this equation approach zero except
the second term in the left-hand side. The choice of test function implies that the
unfolding criterion in Theorem 3.4 is satisfied. So, unfolding this term by 7; together
with Theorem 3.3 (4), (i), (vit), and (viii) yield

ff Avuave (Z) ae B [TANT Tua) TET (Vo (Z)) dedy.

This, together with (4.10), (4.9) (ii) and Theorems 3.3 (iz) and 3.2 allow us to pass
to the limit to obtain

lim j, _Avuesv¥e (Z ) dz = hy A(z, y)(Vuo + Va) pV, oly) drdy,

from which (4.13) follows by the density in Theorem 3.36.

Step 3. For (4.14) and (4.15), we consider the effect of the perforations in the limit
equation by letting y € D(M) and take w-st) as a test function in (4.4), where wes is
given in Theorem 3.35. Then, (4.4) is rewritten as

fh ASV ues Vest) dz + fh, A’ Vucswes Vp de

“=f, foabar+ f, Gewesp doz. (476)

This choice of test function implies that the unfolding criterion in Theorem 3.20 is
satisfied.

Chapter 4. Linear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 39

For the first integral in the left-hand side of this equation, unfolding by T-s together
with Theorems 3.19 (i), 3.21, and 3.35, we obtain

For the second term in the right-hand side of (4.16), unfolding by Té with Theo-

By H2, Theorems 3.26 (i), 3.27, and Remark 3.38, we get the limit

lim [ng Sees dos = Mav(B)|OB|Moa(a) fi var. (4.20)

Thus, passing to the limit in (4.16) through (4.17) - (4.20) we get the limit equation
given by

fo cura 4002 2). (2,2) Ve 0(2)v dads
+v(B) f vy Ae y)0(Vu + Vya) dedy (4.21)

which by density holds for all y € H3({) and v € Kg. When v(B) = 0, we get (4.14).
Moreover, when u(B) # 0, by integration by parts in the first term in (4.21),

—0(B) f cop 10(%12)VUv5y dda,
+0(B) [Ale u) Vu Vut Vea) dedy

= 0(B) [ fudedy + da0(B)|OB|Moa(o) f var,
from which (4.15) directly follows. S

Let us now have the classical formulation in which the proof is similar to that of
Theorem 5.9.

We first introduce (as in (15]) the classical correctors X; for j = 1,...,N for the
homogenization in fixed domains (for more details, see [5]) which solve the following

cell problems:
Xj € L°(0; Hpar(¥)),
[ae y)V(%j — yj) Ve =0 ae. inQ,

Vy € H},,(Y).

Chapter 4. Linear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 4l

Also, x is the solution of the cell problem corresponding to the holes 6B given by
xe L”(0; Ka), x(z,B)=1,
fam\p Molt: 2)Vix(a, z)V.U(2) dz = 0 ae. in Q,
VW € Kg with ¥(B) =0.
Set the function

Q(z) = ‘Ao(a, 2)Vex(a, z)Vex(e, 2) dz,

RN\B
which is nonnegative and can be interpreted as the local capacity of the set B.

Theorem 4.7 (Classical Formulation) The limit function up is the unique solu-
tion of the homogenized problem

{ —div(A®°™Vup) + up = f + A2l9Bl|Mon(g) in Q,
u =0 on AQ.

Here, A*™ is the classical homogenized matrix given by
N az;
bom) — _ | xs,
Abge(a) = J, (au(erw) — Yo ou(e 0) 2.0) ay.
We end this section by discussing the contribution of each data in the limit problem.

Remark 4.8 The oscillations in the matrix give rise to the classical homogenized
matrix A*°™ in the limit problem. The set of Neumann holes Bé contributed the
constant A|9B|Mop(g). The choice of the test function contributed to the zero-order
strange term A?7@up.

Remark 4.9 Notice that we recover the limit problem in [38] but here we have
additional terms (as in (15]) that capture the effect of the perforations by using
another suitable test function. Thus, we are able to refine the results in [38].

Remark 4.10 The strange term ?@up is similar to that obtained in [15], [24] and
[20].

Chapter 5

Quasilinear Elliptic Problem

in Domains with Small Holes

In this chapter, we deal with a quasilinear elliptic problem situated in a periodically

perforated domain with holes of orders depending on small parameters as in Section

3.5.2. We will have the well-posedness of the problem and obtain some homogeniza-

tion results. We use the key ideas in [7] for the treatment of the quasilinear matrix.
Consider the quasilinear elliptic problem given by

—div (A‘(x, Ue5,6)VUe515.) = f(z) in Qe665
Uc5,5. = 0 on 09,4, UBS, (5.1)
AS (a, eds) V Ueb89 ° Meby + €7Te(E)A(Ues,e) = Ge(t) on OTZ?..

Here, the domain 5,, and the boundaries 0°%,,;,,0B5 and 67% are defined in
Section 3.5.2. We prescribe a nonlinear Robin-type condition on the boundary of the
holes T& and a Dirichlet-type condition on the boundary of the holes B& and on
O9,, 5,. We also let 7 > 0 and nes, be the unit exterior normal vector to T23, and the
functions A‘, 7, and g, are given by

(i) AM(@, ues) = A (Esteve)
(a) na) =7 (= {3}), (62)
(ai) ae) = 9 (= {2}).

The extension of the periodic unfolding operator discussed in Section 3.5.2 will be
applied to homogenize this problem.

Some physical applications include the Fruendlich kinetics model for chemical
reactions on the walls of a chemical reactor where chemical reactive flows through
the exterior of a domain containing periodically distributed reactive solid grains as

in [23] given by
—D,Au = f in NF,

correspoding to the case when A® = I,,y = 1,7e = 1,9. = 0,h(u) = |ul?-4u, for
a@ € (0,1) and the scale factor Ds > 0, as the diffusion coefficient. This system
becomes the Langmuir kinetics model for chemical reactions (for more details, see
[23]) when A(u) = au/(1 + Bu) for positive a and f.

Another application involves some nonlinear thermal flows through a periodically
perforated domain. This describes the heat conduction through the exterior of a
domain containing periodically distributed conductive grains which is important in
considering climatization problems as in [43] in the same system above where h(v) is
given by

1 udh,
hu) = 9 uk jul <j,
-1 u<-}

S-E
for a given k > 0.

Some known results related to this problem considered a linear problem with
nonhomogeneous Neumann condition prescribed on some holes and a homogeneous
Dirichlet condition on the other holes along with the outer boundary [21], a perforated
domain setting of the problem was dealt in [7], and a linear Robin problem in two
small holes was shown in [39].

5.1 Preliminary results

In this section, we will prove the well-posedness of (5.5) and show that the solution
satisfies an a priori estimate. Also, we give some properties concerning the nonlinear

boundary condition and the quasilinear term.

Chapter 5. Quasilinear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 47

Theorem 5.3 Under assumptions R1, R2, and RS (i) and (iii), problem (5.5) ad-
mits at least a solution ucs,s, € Ves,5_ satisfying the a priori estimate:

Ilte8s63lVeeyeg < Cs (5.9)
for some constant C > 0. Moreover, if RS (iv) holds, this solution is unique.

Proof. The proof of the existence and uniqueness of the solution directly follow from
the arguments in [6] (see also (12]) which utilizes Schauder’s Fixed Point Theorem
and the results in [39], and using the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem in
passing to the limit of the quasilinear matrix as in [7]. We omit the proof here.

Let us prove the estimate in (5.9).

Chapter 5. Quasilinear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 48
We recall next, a theorem that will enable us to obtain a convergence in the
boundary.

Theorem 5.4 (Nemytskii Operator, [35]) Let Q be a bounded open set in RY,
h: Rvs R be a continuous function and F, : u ++ h(u), its associated Nemytskii
operator. For py, p2 € [1,+00[, the following are equivalent:

(i) Fy acts from L?'(2) into L*(Q).
(it) Fh is bounded and continuous from 1! (Q) into L®(Q).
(iit) There exist a,b > 0 such that

|h(m)| <a-+b|m|=, WmeR.

Let us have a result equivalent to Proposition 3.4 of [6] written for 25,5).

Theorem 5.5 Let t > 1 be given by

2N

t ifN = = ——__
€[1,2[ fN=2andq>1, t qN-2)+2

otherwise.

Then h: H*(Q45,8,) +> W*(Qe6,8,) and the map u++ h(u) ts bounded.

We now state an equivalent result to Lemma 3.4 of [39] with the proof following
the arguments in Theorem 6.1 of [19].

Theorem 5.6 Let {w.} be a bounded sequence in V.4,5, 30 that there is some w €
H4(Q) such that
wu, weakly in L?(2).

Then,
Thyay(h(we))  A(w), weakly in Li, (9, W!-t(8T)) where t = POEL ES}

Proof. First, by Theorem 3.22 written for T/s,5,, we have that for all r € [2,2°[,
Tes,5,(We) + w strongly in Ly,,(2 x Y). (5.11)
Since for N 2 3,

2
= ON It OY

Chapter 5. Quasilinear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 49

there exists s € (2, 2*[ such that $ >q. This with Remark 5.2 (iv) implies that
|a(w)| < C( + wl?) < C(1 + |wl?).
Thus, by Theorem 5.4, and properties (5.10) and (5.11), we obtain
Tebsta(h(we))(z, 2) = h (Tessa (we)) (2,2) + h(w) strongly in Li,.( x Y). (5.12)

By the second estimate in Theorem 3.19 (vi) written for 7s,s, and with Theorem
5.5, there exists a function ho € W!#() such that

Tebsta(h(we))(2, 2) > ho strongly in Li,.(9; W™(¥)).

This, together with (5.12), gives h, = h(w), which by Theorem 3.28 written for Tcs,4,,
concludes the proof.

The next theorem gives the unfolding of the quasilinear matrix as in [7].

Theorem 5.7 Suppose ¢,61, and 52 satisfy R4 and let u25,5. © Ves, be the solution
of (5.5). Then up to a subsequence, there exist uy € H1(2) and @ € 12,,(0; Hi,(Y)),
Y-periodic, such that

(i) Teby6a(tebs52) > Uo weakly in L?(0; Hi.(Y)),
(ti) Teb,6q(V tes) > Vuo + Vyi — weakly in L2.(2 x Y), (5.13)
(iii) T3,4,(h(tes,4)) > (uo) weakly in Li,.(@, W-#(8T)).

Also, we have the following convergences of the unfolding of the quasilinear matriz

{ (i) Te(A"(@, tues.5.))(Z19) + A(Y, Uo) ae. in DXY, (6.14)

(ii) Tes,5,(A*(z, Ue5,5))(z,z) + A(z, Uo) ae. in. 2 x (RY \ B).

Proof. In view of estimate (5.9) and Definition 3.29, the existence of up € H*()
and @ € 12,(2; HL.(Y)), Y-periodic, such that (5.13) (¢) and (7) hold, follow from
Theorem 3.23 while that of (5.13) (iii) follows from Theorem 5.6.

Let us prove (5.14). By Definition 3.1, (5.2) (i), and R3 (2), one has

=4(E(« GEE a =) 1 Tel ted54)(2, v)

~a(, +, Teltesse)(2,0))
Ay, Te(te8s6)(2,9))

Chapter 5. Quasilinear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 50
ae. in Qe x Y and that 7;(A‘(2, ues4))(z,y) = 0 ae. in Ae x Y. From (5.13) (i),
there exists a subsequence (still denoted by ¢) such that

Te(te6) > Up ae.inQxY.
This, together with the above computation, yields

TAS (2, Ues,8))(2, ¥) = A (y, Te(tes,4)(2,y)) + A(y, Uo) ae. in 2x Y.
This shows (5.14) (i).

Similarly, from a change of variable z = dy together with Definitions 3.1, 3.16
and 3.29, and R3 (i), one has

(
(7) + 612, Teb62 (ted: 52)(2, 2))

which by the same argument as above yields (5.14) (ii).

5.2 Homogenization results

In this section, we prove the unfolded limit problem and convert to its corresponding
strong formulation. We end the section by interpreting the contributions of each data
at the limit.

Theorem 5.8 (Limit Problem) Let 1¢5,5. € Ves,s, be the solution of (5.5), where
£,6,, and b9 satisfy R4. Then up to a subsequence, there exists uy € H}(Q) such that

teas, > ty weakly in L?(Q). (5.15)

Also, there exist @ € L2,,(2; Hi,,(Y)), Y-periodic, and U € L7(9;12,(R")) with
U=rytp in L?(9; Kg) such that the ordered triple (uo, %,U) solves the following limit
equations:

for all p € H3(Q),

(5.18)

where vg is the unit exterior normal to the set B and da, the surface measure.
Proof. We provide the proof in several steps.

STEP 1. First, note that (5.15) is immediate from the estimate in (5.9). Also, the
existence of up € Hg (2) such that (5.15) holds and @ € L2,,(2; Hi.(Y)), Y-periodic,
is guaranteed by Theorem 5.7 (5.13) (i) and (ii).
Moreover, the existence of U € L?(9; L2,,(R")) such that U— st is in L?(; Kp)
follows from the arguments given in [15], so we omit the details of the proof here.
Let us now proceed to the limit equations.

STEP 2. To prove (5.16), suppose y € D(M) and y € C},,(Y) be vanishing in a
neighborhood of the origin. Then for ¢,6,, and 6; small enough, Y(-) = ev(-o(z) is

in Vess6-

Chapter 5. Quasilinear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 52

Note that as € approaches zero, the terms in this equation approach zero except the
second one in the left-hand side. Also, the choice of test function implies that the
unfolding criterion in Theorem 3.4 is satisfied. So, unfolding this term by 7; together
with Theorem 3.3 (i), (iii), (vii), and (viii) yield

B fy TANT (Vues) TAW)T. (Vo (Z)) dzdy (6.19)

By (5.13) (i), R3 (i), (5.14) (i), and Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem, we
have
T.(A‘ (2, Ue6,5,))Te(Vip) > ‘A(y, uo)Vp strongly in L?(Q x Y).

This, together with Theorems 3.2, 3.3 (iz), and Corollary 3.5 allows us to pass to the
limit in (5.19) to obtain

lim A¥ (2, thes; 5) Vte8, 5: OV 9 (2) dz = f ‘Ay, uo) Vyp(y)(Vuo + Vay dedy,

0 Jn,4,

from which (5.16) follows by the density in Theorem 3.36.

Step 3. For (5.17) and (5.18), we consider the effect of the perforations in the limit
equation by letting ~ € D(2Q) and take w,5,y as a test function in (5.5), where wes,
is the function given in Theorem 3.35. Thus we have

Again, this choice of test function implies that the unfolding criterion in Theorem
3.20 is satisfied.
For the first integral in the left-hand side of this equation, unfolding by 76,5,

Chapter 5. Quasilinear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 53

together with Theorems 3.19 (i), 3.21, and (3.3), we obtain

For the third integral in the left-hand side of (5.20), it is clear that if y > 0, the
integral approaches zero. On the other hand, if = 0, unfolding by 7,5, together
with Theorems 3.25 and 3.26 (ii), we obtain

Thus, passing to the limit in (5.20) through (5.22)-(5.25) we get the limit equation

which by density holds for all y € H3(Q) and v € Kg. When v(B) = 0, we get (5.17).
Moreover, when v(B) # 0, by integrating by parts in the first integral in (5.26) and
since v € Kg, so v = v(B) in OB, we have

The next theorem gives the classical form of the homogenized system given in
(5.16)-(5.18). We first introduce (as in [15]) the classical correctors 2; for j =1,...,N
for the homogenization in fixed domains (for more details, see [5]) which solve the
following cell problems:

R € L™(2; H,(Y)),
[AW wz) VR —y))Ve=0 a0. in 2, (5.28)
vy € H}..(Y).
Also, x is the solution of the cell problem corresponding to the holes 6,B given by

fh yg Mle tole) Vex(=, uo(2)) Ve (2) dz = 0 ae. in 2, (5.29)
VW € Kg with U(B) = 0.

Set the function © as
(2) = fy. Mo(2vo(2))Vex(2, ole) Vex(e, o(2)) dz, (6.80)

which is nonnegative and can be interpreted as the local capacity of the set B. We
then have the following classical formulation in which the derivation is standard (see
for instance, [15]).

Theorem 5.9 (Classical Formulation) If > 0, then uo € H() is the unique
solution of the homogenized problem

—div(A™™Vuo) + Kj7Ous = f + K2l9T|Mor(9) in Q,

tu =0 on 8.

Chapter 5. Quasilinear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 56

Ify=0 andh is Positively homogeneous of degree 1, then uo is the unique solution
of the homogenized problem

{ ~div( AME Vue) + w1Ouo + e2h(ua)|OT|Mer(r) = f+ mal@T|Mar(9) in 9,
Uo = 0 on 82.
(5.31)
In both systems, @(zx) is given by (5.30), and A®°™ is the homogenized matriz given
by
N eS
Apn(z) = f (autu uo(z)) — D> oxy 2o(2)) 5, w0(2)) dy. (5.32)
k=l ke

Proof. We only prove the case when + = 0, since the case when 7 > 0 is similar. We
follow here the arguments in [15] and [21].

First, note that with %j solving (5.28), one gets (see for instance [5])

N
G2, y) = ~ > 2 (2)R4(y,wol@))-

Using this expression for @ in (5.18), we have

(5.33)

with A®™ given by (5.32). Now, applying integration by parts in (5.29), using (5.17)
and the property (see (15]) that V.U = V.W, we have

he A(z, uo)V Up doy = te A(z, to) Vz(U — nito)vp do,

which is the variational formulation of (5.31) with @(z) given by
O(2) = [Holz v0(z))V-x(2,to(e))¥e dos

which is an equivalent form of (5.30). The well-posedneas of the classical formulations
follow from the arguments in [12] as in the proof of Theorem 5.3. IN]

Chapter 5. Quasilinear Elliptic Problem in Domains with Small Holes 57

We end this section by discussing the contribution of each data in the limit problem.

Remark 5.10 The oscillations in the quasilinear matrix give rise to the homoge-
nized matrix A>™ in the limit problem. The set of Robin holes T? contributed the
constant *2|9T|Mar(g) when y > 0; while it contributed the term 2|8T|(Mar(g) —
Mor(r)h(uo)) when -y = 0. The choice of the test function contributed to the zero-
order strange term x?@up.

Remark 5.11 The strange term x?@up is similar to that obtained in [21], [39], [15],
[24] and {20}.

Chapter 6

Linear Parabolic Problem

in Perforated Domains

In this chapter we will deal with the well-posedness and homogenization of a parabolic
problem with nonlinear Robin boundary condition.
In particular, we consider the parabolic problem given by

u,(z, t) — div (A*(z)Vu,(z, t)) = f(z, t) in Qf x [0,7],
u,(z,t) =0 on (802 \ 95.) x [0,7], (6.1)
Af (z)Vue(z,t) + ne + 772(2)h(ue) = ge(z,t) on OS, x [0,7], ,
ue(x, 0) = uP(z) in Q,

where

g9(2.t) if Mes(9) =0,

eg(Z,t) if Mas(9) £0.
Here, 27 and S, are the sets defined in Section 3.3 and n, is the unit exterior normal

ge(z,t) =

vector to S, and u’(z, t) is the derivative with respect to the variable t. We prescribe
a nonlinear Robin-type condition on the boundary of the holes S,, a Dirichlet-type
condition on the boundary of 97 that does not include the boundary of the holes S,,
and we set an initial value u2(z) in 3.

Some physical applications involve models of heat flow in a perforated material
whose temperature is dependent on time, propagation problems such as in mass
diffusion, momentum diffusion, and the unsteady heat diffusion in a solid (for more
details, see [34]). Also, one can model the flow of a gas through a porous medium by
using the conservation of mass as in Darcy’s Law and equation of states as in [40].

In the literature, some related known results were shown for the quasilinear case
with nonhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition in [1], using the Faedo-Galerkin
method to show well-posedness in the heat equation (see also [2]), the treatment of
the Robin term h(v) in [19] and [7], and using the periodic unfolding method in the
homogenization of the heat equation in perforated domains in [31] (see also [29]).

Here, O Cc RY is open and bounded, S be an open set in O with Lipschitz continuous
boundary and which we will refer to as the hole in O, by n the unit exterior normal

boundary of the holes S, a Dirichlet-type condition on the boundary of O that does
not include the boundary of the holes S, and set an initial value u°(zx) € L?(O) in O.

so that we obtain,
L -div(AVu)vdz = f AVuVods — fo ((AVu) i) vdoz, (6.10)
Now, notice that by the boundary conditions in (6.5),
fo (AVu- fi) ude, = hows (AVu- i) vdoz +f, (AVu- fi) vdo,
=0+ f, (a - arh(u)v) doz,
so that we obtain,
fo (AVu- fi) vdo, = [9740 - fk ath(u)vdo;. (6.11)
Thus, by (6.9) - (6.11),
1 - _ =
[weds [ Avuvode (fsa forbw)edos) = ff fods,

from which (6.8) directly follows.
Next, we show that (6.8) is well-posed.

6.1 Well-posedness result

As in [1] and [2] (for details see [16] and [27]), we show the well-posedness of (6.8)
using the Faedo-Galerkin Method. We follow these steps in the proof of the next

theorem.

Chapter 6. Linear Parabolic Problem in Perforated Domains 63

Theorem 6.5 (Existence and Uniqueness) Let T > 0. Under N1-N4, problem
(6.8) admits a unique solution u € W such that

Irsllasocrza0y + llullw < C, (6.12)
where is C a constant depending on a, B,O and T.

Proof. We give the proof in several steps.

STEP 1. (Construction of subspaces and the approximate problem) Let E, be an
n-dimensional subspace of L?(O) spanned by the orthonormal basis {m,...,7™n} in
17(O). Define the projection operator P, : W + E, a8
Pav) = Sov, ms)i(o)mj € En, Wu € 170). (6.13)
j=l

From classical results in Hilbert spaces (see for example [5]), one has

Palle <1, (6.14)
and
P,(v) + v strongly in L?(0), Wu € L?(0). (6.15)
Observe that by (6.14), we have
IPa(e)llv < [Pallewvollelly < llvllv- (6.16)

Since u° € L?(O) and if we set u° = P,(u°), then by (6.15),
u® — u° strongly in L?(0). (6.17)
Now, we have the following finite-dimensional approximate problem for (6.8):

Find u,(z,t) € E, such that
£ u,v dz + L AVunVv dz + i ath(un)v doz

(6.18)
= [fvde+ | gvde.,
for every v € V and ¢ €]0,T|,
Un(z, 0) = u2(z) in O.

Chapter 6. Linear Parabolic Problem in Perforated Domains 64
Equivalently,
Find u,(z, t) = j=1 C7(t)m; € E,, such that
L ulm, dr + f AV un Vm, dz
+ g27h(tn)ma dos = ff fede + | ome doe, (6.19)
for all k € {1,...,n} and for ae. ¢ €]0,7I,
Un(z, 0) = uo in O.

By the initial condition and (6.13),

n n
p> G(0)m; = un(z,0) = ul = Pru? = yw, m3) 14(0)™5,
= =

which implies that c?(0) = (u°, m;)za(0) by the linear independence of {m,...,77n}-
From here, we obtain a system of n linear ordinary differential equations equivalent
to (6.19) given by:

d n

Fatt) + yao f AVmj(2) Vm, dz

+ fLarh( Sha Gltm,)mados =f frade+ f omedos,

for all k € {1,...,n} and t €]0,T[,

(6.20)

ch (0) = (u°, me) za(0)-

By standard arguments as in [22], the existence and uniqueness of a continuous
solution cf,...,c% to (6.20) is guaranteed on the interval [0, T]. Consequently, we can
now uniquely determine u, € C((0,7]; En)-

Step 2. To prove the a priori estimate
[leall =(0,7;22(0)) + [lull z2@,7:v) + lluallzz@r.vy < C, (6.21)

we first show an estimate satisfied by first two terms in the left-handside above.
Multiply the k-th equation in (6.19) by cf and sum from k = 1,...n, so that

[ratende+ [AV un Vein de + fh 07h tn)tn de

Note that from Remark 6.2 and N2 (iti), one has

(6.22)

ath(un)tn > 0. (6.23)

Chapter 6. Linear Parabolic Problem in Perforated Domains 6
Then, by N1, (6.6), (6.22), (6.23), Poincaré and Cauchy-Schwarz Inequalities, Trace

This and (6.17) implies that u, € L°(0,7; L?(O))  L7(0,T; V) which satisfies the

We are left to show the estimate in the third term in the left-handside of (6.21).

Srep 3. Next, we show that the initial condition is satisfied. By the estimate in
(6.25), there exists a subsequence {un} and a function u € L7(0, T; V)NL(0, T; L?(O))
and by using from Remark 2.19 with the separability of L1(0,T;L7(O)) and that

(L(0, T; L?(O))Y = L°(0,T; L7()),

, we have

Chapter 6. Linear Parabolic Problem in Perforated Domains 67

Un > u_ weakly* in L*(0,T; L?(0)). (6.28)
Next, by the Eberlein-Smuljan Theorem (see Theorem 2.16) we have
Un —u_ weakly in L?(0,T;V), (6.29)
Lastly, by the reflexivity of V applied in Theorem 2.61.
u, —u’ weakly in L7(0,T; V’). (6.30)

Let p(t) € D([0, T]) and v € V. Taking P,(v)p as a test function in (6.18) and
integrating over (0, 7], we get

That is, u solves the equation in (6.8).

Since u, € W, then (6.31) is still valid for p € C™({0,7]). For the initial condition,
choose such ¢ such that y(0) = 1 and y(T) = 0. Integrating by parts the first term
in the left-hand side of (6.31), we obtain

Meanwhile, by a product rule

have

Equivalently,

Adding (6.33) and (6.34), we obtain
=f
fue O)udr = Le p(O)udz, WevV.
This implies that u(z,0) = u°, and so u is a solution of (6.8).
Step 4. We show the a priori estimate on u. By the lower-semicontinuity of the norm
as in Theorem 2.15 (ii) and Remark 2.19, we have
Ulullz=¢o,7:12(¢0y + llullw = [lulle=o,r:14¢6y + llullu=e.rvy + llu'lle=o-r:v7

This along with (6.21) imply (6.12).
Lastly, we show the uniqueness of the solution u. Let u;, uz be solutions of (6.8)

and let w = u; — ug. Since u; and uz are solutions of (6.8),

[wivae+ [Avuvode+ [arh(uodoe= [ fodr+ |, gvde. (6.38)

Chapter 6. Linear Parabolic Problem in Perforated Domains 69

and
uvdz+ [ AVWV =

Subtracting (6.36) from (6.35), we obtain
(ul —u)'vdz +/ AV = =
L L (u — ug) Vudz + fe arh(u — u2)vdo, = 0.
Equivalently by the choice of w,
[pwras + [Avuvude+ J arhtw)v dos =0, (6.37)
for any t € [0,7] with the initial condition
w(z, 0) = u:(z,0) — up(z, 0) = u%(2) — w%(z) =0 in O.

Let w be a test function in (6.37). First, note from Remark 5.2 (iv) and N2 (iii), we
have

arh(w)w > 0.
Then, by a product rule, N1, (6.6) and Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality,

Now, we state the well-posedness of (6.38). Here, we omit the proof as it follows
from Theorem 6.5.

Theorem 6.6 (Existence and Uniqueness) LetT > 0. Under J1-J4, then (6.38)
admits a unique solution tu, € W, such that

Iluell 22° (0,7;22(%2)) + Iluellwe < C, (6.39)

where is C a constant.

6.2 Homogenization results

Let us now have the asymptotic behavior of the solution written for IY] = |[0, 1)%] =1.
First, let us recall the variational formulation of (6.1) given by

In this part, we obtain the limit equation. Here, the extension of the periodic un-
folding operator discussed in Section 3.4 will be applied to homogenize this problem.
But first, we recall a theorem that we will need in the proof.

Theorem 6.7 ([7]) Let {we} be a bounded sequence in V, so that there is some

Then,

Let u, € V, be the solution of (6.38). Under J1-J4, there exists u € L7(0,T; H}(Q))

Substituting this in (6.55) and then subtracting the resulting equation from (6.51)

Theorem 6.9 (Classical Formulation) If 7 = 0 and h is positively homogeneous

If >0, then the limit function u is the unique solution of the homogenized problem

Remark 6.10 The oscillations in the coefficient matrix give rise to the classical

to the domain 2 the constant |95|Mas(g) when y > 0 and the term |9S|(Mas(g) —
Mos(r)h(u)) when y = 0.

Summary

The main objective of this thesis was to describe the asymptotic behaviors of some
boundary value problems posed in perforated domains.

The first one is linear elliptic problem posed in a domain with small holes given
by the system

—div (A*(z)Vugs(z)) = f(z) in gs,
A®(x)Vues(z) - nes = ge(z) on OB%, (7.1)
urs(z) = 0 on Oq6 \ OBE,

where a nonhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition is imposed on the holes. For
the homogenization of this problem, we used a test function of the form ‘wes, where

we D(Q) and
wes(2) = (8) - (5 {2}),

with v € D(R‘)N Kz. With this choice, we obtained an additional term from the
recovered limit equation given by

Moreover in the classical formulation, we obtained the zero-order “strange” term
Cup

contributed by the choice of the test function. The nonnegative term © can be
interpreted as the local capacity of the set B. Again, this term is similar to the
one obtained in the works [21], [39], [15], [24] and [20]. This is due to the critical
sizes of the Dirichlet and Neumann holes as in [24] and [20]. For the comparison
of results for the linear elliptic problem in domains with small holes, as from Table
7.1 we get the classical coefficient matrix as in [38] and [15]. Also, we produced the
same contribution of the Neumann boundary condition from the work done in [38],
and an additional term when compared with the limit problem in [15]. However,
since we used the same test function as in [15], we obtained more details about the
limit problem as viewed by its zero-order “strange” term. The work done in [38] was

recovered in the limit problem as well and corresponds to a special case when the size
éé is just €, that is the case when 6 = 1.

The second one, we dealt with is a quasilinear elliptic problem posed in a domain
with two small holes given by the system

—div (AS (z, 4e6,5,)Vuesi6.) = f(z) in Qe6621
Urs, = 0 on 69%;,5, VOB, (7.2)
AS(2, t1655,)V ted 84 * Theby + €7Te()A(Ues,) = ge) on OT.

In this problem, we imposed a nonlinear Robin boundary condition on some holes
while a Dirichlet condition is prescribed on the other holes as well as on the outer
boundary. To homogenize this problem, we again used a test function of the form
‘wes, and obtained the corresponding zero-order “strange” term. However in the pro-
cess of doing so, we encountered some difficulties. To deal with quasilinear matrix, we
proved by definition the limit of its unfolding as given in Theorem 5.7 (5.14). Another
difficulty is the term h. For this one, we proved some preliminary convergences of the
unfolding of h along the boundary using the idea of its associated Nemytskii operator
as can be seen in Theorem 5.6. Also, to analyze the behavior of the limit functions
with respect to the term €7, we considered two cases: = 0 and > 0. We observed
that when 7 = 0, the term

walT|Mor(r) jf h(ue)v de

appeared in 2 and when 7 > 0, this term vanished on the limit equation.

The second difficulty in this problem was due to the presence of a quasilinear term.
Solving this one gave us an insight on the contribution of a quasilinear coefficient
matrix as seen in Table 7.2 compared to the classical homogenized matrix obtained
in [39] and [21]. It is also important to notice that our results especially for the
nonlinear Robin boundary condition was more general than that of [39] since we
considered a generalized version in the original problem statement.

In dealing with problems given in (7.1) and (7.2), we obtained the same contri-
bution of the choice of the test function and produced a similar zero-order “strange”
term as seen in [15] and (21).

Lastly, we considered a linear parabolic problem posed in a periodically perforated

Chapter 7. Summary 78

domain given by the system

u;(z, t) — div (A*(z)Vu,(z, t)) = f(z, t) in Q2 x [0,7],

u,(z,t) =0 on (AN3 \ OS.) x [0,7], (73)
A®(z)Vue(z, t) - ne + €77(z)h(Ue) = ge(z, t) on OS, x [0,7], ,
Ue(z, 0) = u(x) in 2.

Here, we prescribed a nonlinear-Robin boundary condition on the inner boundary
while a Dirichlet condition is imposed on the outer boundary. Here, the difficulty arose
from the presence of the nonlinear Robin. boundary condition which needs preliminary
convergences to pass to the limit. For the existence and uniqueness results, we put
the problem to a more general framework. In particular we dealt with the system

u'(z, t) — div(A(z)Vu(z, t)) = f(z, t) in O x [0,7],

u(z,t) =0 on (80 \ aS) x {0,T],
A(z)Vu(z, t)- n+ ar(z)h(u) = g(z,t) on OS x [0,T],
u(z,0) = u°(z) in O.

We showed the well-posedness using the Faedo-Galerkin method and to deal with the
difficulty in obtaining the estimate on the solution for the approximate problem, we
found an estimate for the function h (see Remark 6.2).

For the asymptotic behavior of (7.3), in order to deal with difficulty on passing to
the limit on the function h, we used Theorem 6.7. Also, to analyze the behavior of
the limit functions with respect to the term €7, we considered two cases: y = 0 and
7 > 0. From here, we saw that when 7 = 0, the term

[aS|Mas(r) [” [ n(uy¥¢ deat,

appeared in the domain 2 and when 7¥ > 0, this term vanished on the limit equation.
Moreover, for the linear parabolic problem posed in perforated domains, as from Table
7.3 we obtained the classical coefficient matrix as in [31] compared to the quasilinear
contribution in [1]. Also, due to the nonlinear Robin boundary condition that we
imposed, additional terms in the limit problem appeared as compared to the two
works which only tackled Neumann boundary conditions.

Using the following tables, we give a brief summary. Here, we use NH to denote

nonhomogeneous and H for homogeneous.
