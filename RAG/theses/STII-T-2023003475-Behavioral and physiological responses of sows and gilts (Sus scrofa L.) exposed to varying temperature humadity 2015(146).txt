ABSTRACT

Two studies were conducted to identify the effects of evaporative cooling system
(ECS) on sow productivity performance on-farm and another study aimed to understand
the physiological, behavioral responses and plasma HSP 70 of 6 mos-old gilts (98±6 kg),
exposed at gradual increase in chamber’s temperature humidity index (THI). The first
study was accomplished from February to November 2014 comprising three batches of
sows (batch 1= 99; batch 2=91; batch 3=77) at different parities. Results showed that for
batch 1, late parity sows (above 5) from ECS obtained 3.6d earlier weaning to service
interval (WSI). Also, late parity sows in batch 2, from ECS obtained higher total pigs
bom (TPB) and litter size born alive (LSB), ie. 2.85 and 2.7, respectively (P<0.05).
Comparable results were observed for batch 3 in all sow productivity parameters. Batches
2 and 3 i.e. from April to November obtained a THI value of 76 - 84 in ECS while non-
ECS obtained 79 - 87.5. Sows of batches 2 and 3 even in ECS experienced stress, suggesting limited benefit of ECS. The second study involved video monitoring of behavior for 3 days in each THI
set-up. The plasma, pulse, respiration, rectal temperature and feed intake were sampled at
0700 and 1500 hours of the first day exposure to a given THI set-up. The plasma HSP 70
was elevated (P<0.05) at THI 71 (3.42 to 3.46 ng/l), indicative of stress. The respiration
rate increased significantly beyond THI 77. The interaction of period of the day and
temperature humidity index shows that at THI 77, morning and afternoon meals are
significantly lower than THI 71. Therefore, cumulative average morning or afternoon
meal intake duration lower 2250 seconds (37minutes) is the best indicator of stress in gilts.

CHAPTER 1

General Introduction

According to Calud (2014), swine farms in the Philippines had a minimal sow
productivity improvement, in terms of pigs produced per sow per year. For the past
several years the average pigs produce per sow per year was 18.23 only.

Heat stress was cited to be one of the main reasons of low sow productivity in
different countries. It negatively impacts the animal performance in tropical countries
during summer, which results in very important economic losses in livestock industries.
Improved housing and cooling systems were one of the major advances in environmental
management that can attenuate the thermal stress on performances (Gourdine et al.,
2012). In the Philippines, heat stress was one of the factors causing the decrease in swine
production as evidenced by the 3 quarter productivity syndrome.

Several authors had also stated different behavioral and physiological responses
of sows and gilts in an increasing temperature aside from the low productivity
performance as a consequence of heat stress. The studies on heat shock protein (hsp) 70
in relation with different stress factors were few.

Thus, this study was conducted to analyze the reproductive performances of sows
in houses with and without evaporative cooling system (ECS). Also to understand the
responses of sexually matured gilts, including the physiological and behavioral responses
and extracellular HSP 70 concentrations, exposed at gradual increase in controlled

chamber’s temperature.

Hypothesis

Heat stress significantly affects physiological responses, feed intake, water intake,
standing and lying behaviors, body energy reserve or back fat thickness, number and
weight of litters at weaning and weaning to estrous interval (non-productive days of

sows/ dry period).

Significance of the study

ECS as a mitigating means to solve heat stress remains unknown in the country.
Thus, this study assessed the effects of evaporative cooling system in sows reproductive
performance. It was also the pioneering study on the effect of varying THI levels on the
HSP 70, behavioral and physiological responses of gilts which could help us to further
identify sows’ condition under stress. Solving the stress condition of sows will improve
the reproductive parameters. Hence, the overall goal of this study is to improve litter size
at weaning, shorten weaning to service interval and improve body energy reserve of sows

and gilts. The conceptual framework of the study was shown in Figure 1

CHAPTER 2

Review of Related Literature

Thermoregulation

Thermoregulation is the ability of the animal to maintain its core body
temperature within certain boundaries. Since pigs are homeotherms, they balanced the
heat gained by metabolism or lost from the environment through thermoregulation.
However, when they are exposed to heat stress they exhibited physiological and
behavioral mechanisms that help them to regulate body temperature. Behavioral
thermoregulation is when the animal changes its posture, orientation and/or microclimate
to regulate its body temperature. Physiological thermoregulation is when the animal alters
metabolic heat load to control (Martin, 2012).

There are four distinct mechanisms for the heat transfer between the animal and
the environment. This includes conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation. The
transfer of heat through a solid or a fluid without movement is called the conduction. On
the other hand, the heat transfer thru a moving medium is called the convection

Radiation is the emission of heat absorbed by the animal and happens between the
animal and the environment, Meanwhile, evaporative and non-evaporative heat loss are

the main mechanisms for heat loss. (Heggheim, 2013)

Thermoneutral zone (TNZ)

Pigs are highly adaptable and will perform well within a wide range of
temperatures which is called as the thermoneutral zone (TNZ). TNZ is the range of the
ambient temperature at pig level within which a pig can maintain normal body

temperature (39°C) through control of sensible heat loss. Within the TNZ pigs effectively

control heat loss by regulating blood flow to the skin but as temperature rises above the
NZ pigs will greatly reduce feed intake, increase water consumption and panting
(Lammers et al., 2007).

However, if the temperature is below the TNZ, which is called as the lower
critical temperature (LCT), the animal increases heat production thru shivering. And if
the temperature is above the TNZ or the upper critical temperature (UCT), the animals

tend to increase the evaporative heat loss to maintain homeostasis. (Mercer, 2001)

of least thermoregulatory effort; (E) upper critical “temperature”; (F) zone of
hypothermia; (CE) zone of minimal metabolism (thermoneutral zone) (WMO,
2010)

Figure 2 shows the representation of partitioned heat production and losses across

a range of thermal environments. Determining the thermal comfort zone of swine is

helpful for environment control thus better animal performance will be obtained (Souza

2004 as cited by Sales et al., 2008). WMO (2010) stated that the animal function most

efficiently at their TNZ.

TNZ for farrowing-nursing sows is between 15-20°C and between 50 to 70% RH

(Sales et al., 2008). According to WMO (1989a) the upper critical temperature (UCT) for

sow (140 kg in an individual pen near maintenance) is 30°C while lower critical
temperature (LCT) is 20°C. Lactating sow’s LCT is 5°C and UCT is 26°C. But according
to Black et al., (1993) lactating sows are exposed to heat stress when temperature exceeds
the UCT of TNZ between 12 and 22°C. The critical temperatures are not fixed for any

species or animal type, but may change depending on age and physiological condition
that is why different ranges of LCT and UCT were observed in different studies. (WMO,
2010)

Figure 3. Typical performance response as a function of ambient temperature. Although an
optimum temperature may exist for an individual animal at a given time and under
specific management practices, optimal conditions for a group of animals involve, a
slightly wider zone of temperature (A.) Performance curve usually show slight

decreases (1-2%) from optimum over broader range of temperature (“nominal loss”
zone B) (WMO, 2010)

Optimum performance of the animal at a given temperature was illustrated in
Figure 3. In evaluating consequences of ambient conditions in farm animals,
consideration of animal resiliency to maintain normal functions through adaptive and
compensatory capabilities is needed. And it is important to note that in a longer term
animal has the mechanism to adapt and compensate to maintain biological processes like
growth despite short-term adverse factors. Thus, these mechanisms blur the sharp
changes noted in short-term factors and losses in growth and efficiency are minimized

over a range of temperatures on either side of the maximum temperature.

Meteorological elements

Heat stress refers to those meteorological elements that interfere with heat loss
from the animal to the environment. (Bloemhof et al., 2008). Meteorological elements
that will be considered for this study will be Relative Humidity,Temperature and
Temperature Humidity Index. In a study of Suriyasomboom et al., (2006), it was
observed that not only elevated temperature had negative impact on reproductive
performance but also elevated humidity. And the combined effects of high temperature
and high humidity play an important role in seasonal changes of sow reproductive

efficiency (Tantasuparuk et al., 2000a; Gourdine et al., 2006)

Temperature Humidity Index (THI)
Thermal environment is evaluated according to thermal comfort indices, which

are based on observed conditions, associated with animal losses and are widely used as

management tool in livestock production (Hugh Jones, 1994; Zulovich et al., 2000 cited
by Sales et al., 2008). Temperature Humidity Index is used to measure the combination

of temperature and humidity (NOAA, 1976 as cited by Sales et al, 2008).

Figure 4. Temperature Humidity Index (THI) Chart based on Thom,1959). Associated
Livestock Weather Safety Index (LWSI;LCI,1970)categories are also shown as cited by

Hanh et al., (2009)

The temperature humidity index (THI) shown in Figure 4 was the one adapted
from the Discomfort Index for Humans, which was developed by Thom (1959). This
index has been extensively applied for moderate to hot conditions using a response

function approach even with recognized limitations related to air speed and radiation heat

loads. Temperature and humidity influence much of the heat exchange impacts of warm
and hot thermal environments and often adequately represent the over all impact in
livestock (Hanh, 1995; St-Pierre et al., 2003; Brown-Brandl et al., 2005 as cited by Hanh
et al., (2009). THI for several years served as a de facto standard for classifying thermal
environments in many animal production and transport situation, and as a basis for
strategic and tactical management practices during seasons other than winter.

Lucas et al., (2000) cited NWSCR, which indicates that THI (in °F) over 75
should be considered as an alert situation in order to prevent future heat stress, THI
between 79 and 83 is dangerous for confined livestock and THI 84 and above will be
very dangerous. Sales et al., (2008) in his study concluded that the thermal comfort zone
for sows is (61<THII<75), intermediate zone is (65<THI<69) and the thermal stress zone
is (69<THI<73).

On the other hand, Zumbach et al. (2008) on his experiment on growing-finishing
pigs found out that the optimum THI(in °C) is 18 and was found out to be lower than the
thresholds found elsewhere. Different thresholds were provided by different authors

which maybe because of differences in the stages of pigs, location and climate during the

experiment.

Heat stress effects
Hot weather adversely affects the performance of pig production (Mount, 1968 as
cited by Lucas et al., 2000). When exposed to higher temperatures swine present

behavioral changes that negatively influence both production and reproduction (Muller,

1982;Curtis,1983;Edwards et al.,1968 as cited by Sales et al., 2008) . Under heat stress
feed consumption and growth rate decrease, and abrupt extreme thermal stress produces
significant losses in all production measures (Ingram, 1964 as cited by Lucas et al., 2000)

According to Huynh et al. (2005) humidity combined with high temperature
affects pig growth. At approximately 22°C clear physiological changes occur in fattening
pigs. Physiological indicators of heat stress are in order of increased respiration rate
(RR), water to feed ratio (WFR), decreased heat production and feed intake and increased
rectal temperature. Humidity had minor effects on physiological measurements but can
affect animal gain when combine with high temperature. On the other hand, for farrowing
sows at 50% humidity the sow thinks it is at 27.2°C when the air temp is 26.7°C. At 70%
humidity the sow think it is 29.4°C when the air temp is 26.7°C (Flowers et al., 2010).
Pigs at different stages may require different RH, T and THI for their optimum
performance.
Heat stress effects on reproductive performance

Several authors documented the effects of high temperature in reproduction
‘Among the 23 analyzed variables related to reproduction in the study of Sales et al
(2008), seven reproductive performances were influenced by environmental changes.
These variables include: weaned piglets per sow per year (WPPS), piglet mortality (PM),
litter average birth weight at day 21 (LAW21), average weight per weaned piglet
(AWWP), mummified fetuses (MF), stillborn (SB).

High temperature has direct and indirect negative effects on reproduction. Indirect

effect is the reduction in feed intake especially during lactation, which resulted to the

decrease of the nutrients available for recovery of the reproductions system. The direct
effect is the increase in maintenance requirements and suppression of certain hormone
even if feed intake is normal. (Flowers, 2010). Reduced feed intake seems to restrict
Luteinizing Hormone release (LH) which resulted in restricted follicle growth during
lactation and then resulting to lesser ovulation rate and impaired quality of oocyte which
may explain increase in embryonic mortality and decrease litter size at farrowing.
Bloemhof et al. (2008) cited different studies, which observed the effect of heat
stress in sows. These studies observed the minimal expression of estrus behavior,
alteration of ovarian follicular development, inhibition of embryonic development,
altered maternal recognition pregnancy at day 16 and 18 of gestation period and increase
of blood plasma cortisol levels in sows. On the other hand, Gourdine et al., (2006)
reported that the first estrus after weaning was delayed in sows exposed to 30°C
‘compared to sows maintain at 20°C. They also found out that even at only 2°C variation
in the ambient temperature there is a significant difference in the reproductive

performances of sows.

Heat stress effects on animal
physiological behaviors

Environmental factors affect the responses of animals, which include growth,
Teproduction, feed intake conversion and mortality. Meanwhile, thermoregulatory
behaviors like body temperatures were recently used to establish thresholds for
disruptions in feeding activities during hot weather thus affecting performances.

Behavioral measures were also related with different thermoregulatory responses.

(WMO,2010)

The manifestation of thermoregulatory behaviors was a result of thermoreceptors
adaptation due to long term exposure to low or high temperature. Longer exposure to
extremely high or low temperature could result to greater tolerance in varying
temperature compared to a sudden exposure only (Olezak 2015).

Johnson et al., (2012) found out that heat stressed group pigs had larger
cumulative difference (~50%) between rectal and skin temperatures compared to pigs in
thermoneutral conditions. Marple et al. (1974) on the other observed that extreme thermal
stress caused increased heart and respiration rate as well as elevated levels of ACTH and
adrenal corticoids and lactate in pigs weighing 65 to 70 kg.

Early and late gestating sows respond to heat stress by increasing rectal
temperature and respiration rate (Williams, 2009). Average rectal temperature was found
to be higher for gestating gilts in heat stress environment (37.8°C, 17h and 32.2°C, 7h)
than control gilts (23.3°C). Meanwhile, the early gestating gilts exposed to constant 33°C
or cyclic (25°C, 6h, 34°C, 3h, 25°C,15h) heat stress from day 3 to day 30 of gestation had
an average rectal temperature of 39.1°C and respiration rate of 58.9 bpm compared with
38.8°C and 25.9 bpm for sows in constant thermo neutral environment of 23°C. (Omtvedt
et al, 1971 and Liao&Veum, 1994 as cited by Williams,2009).

Heat stressed (29°C) multiparous sows consumed less feed compared with
thermoneutral (20°C) during lactation. (Renaudeau et al., 2001). Williams (2009) cited
different studies (Quiniou and Noblet 1999; Spencer et al., 2001; Prunier et al., 1997;

Silva et al., 2009 and Renaudeau et al., 2003) that observed decrease feed intake of sows

when exposed to high temperature.

Huynh (2005) found out that high temperatures greatly affect the lying and
excreting behavior of the growing pigs. At high humidity changes in behaviors occurred
at low temperature. Number of pigs lying on slatted floor could be an indicator for
assessing the welfare of pigs exposed to high ambient temperature.

Pig’s behavior may also differ based on their age, breed, management and
location and climate during the observation or experimental period that is why different

authors cited above provided different physiological behaviors.

Evaporative Cooling System (ECS)

Evaporative cooling system is one of the methods employed to reduce heat stress
in livestock and poultry. It is a cooling effect produced when water evaporates. The
energy used to evaporate water is taken from the air, cooling the air as energy is removed.
It has big advantages when costs of installation and operation are considered, as it is the
most inexpensive way to cool air. However, it also has disadvantages; as water is
evaporated, the humidity of the air is increased and the amount of cooling that can be
produced depends on the air’s relative humidity. The higher the humidity the lower the
cooling effect. (Bucklin et al., 2012)

Several researches documented its benefits which includes the study of Sartor et
al.,(2003) which concluded that the ECS in a finishing phase of swine barn provided an
improvement of the environmental thermal conditions, reducing the index of black globe

temperature and humidity inside the building, from 83.5 to 82.4, during the critical period

of the day (2pm). ECS also provided an improvement in the feed conversion from 3.27 to
2.88 and tendency of substantial weight gain from 0.97 to 1.02kg per day. Gates et al.,
(1991a, 1991b) as cited by Sales et al. (2008) stated that misting systems for growing
finishing hogs minimize the THI in the building and allows the optimum evaporative
cooling to be achieved by the building.

Tunnel ventilation is an example of an evaporative cooling system. This concept
originated with the poultry industry and is now widely used by swine and poultry raisers
to ensure effective summer time ventilation and improved heat stress relief. Poultry and
swine raisers found that increased animal comfort during the summer can be
economically achieved with properly designed, installed, and managed tunnel ventilation
systems.

In a tunnel ventilated buildings, there are fans (called as tunnel fans) that are
placed in one gable end of a building which are operated to create a negative pressure
causing air to be drawn into the opposite gable end wall opening. The fresh inlet air
travels longitudinally through the structure and is exhausted by the tunnel fans. All
sidewall, ceiling and floor openings are closed to form the tunnel so that the ventilation
will function at its maximum potential. (Gooch,et al., 2000), The tunnel fans act like
pumps to move air through air outlets. Pumping air out of a house produced a lowered air
pressure inside the house. The outside air pressure then forces air into the house through
air inlets. In a tunnel ventilated house the air only enters the house at the end and moves
down the house just like water moving through a pipe. The air entering a pipe can be

cooled by drawing it through evaporative cooling pads or by the use of fogging nozzles

located through the house. (Bucklin et al., 2012)

Heat Shock Protein (HSP)

The upregulation of the heat shock proteins (HSPs) was a guarantee for a stress
response. Among the family of HSPs is the 70 kDa HSPs that has several related
isoforms which consists an expressed form of HSC 70 and inducible form of Hsp70.
Aside from structural and functional differences, these two proteins also have different

transcriptional regulation (Robinson, 2005)

Stress or heat shock proteins (HSPs) are the most conserved proteins present in
both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Different physiological and environmental factors
trigger the release of HSPs. They play an essential role as molecular chaperones by
assisting the correct folding of nascent and stress-accumulated misfolded proteins, and
preventing their aggregation.

The study of Cho et al. (2014) found that equine HspH1, HSP 90 and HSP 70
from blood or muscles and selected by differently expressed gene (DEG) analysis had
different gene expressions. HSPs have a dual function depending on their intracellular or
extracellular location. Intracellualr hsp has protective function wherein they allow the
cells to survive lethal condition while extracellular hsps mediate immunological functions
wherein they can elicit an immune response that is modulated either by the adaptive or
innate immune system (Schmitt, 2007).

The release of HSPs was widely associated with the improved resistance and

Negative fitness effects of increasing heat. But there was no established relationship with

the function of HSP 70 and thermotolerance. (Bahrndorff et al., 2009).

Intracellular HSP 70

Under normal conditions, HSP70 proteins function as ATP-dependent molecular
chaperones by assisting the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, the assembly of
multiprotein complexes, and the transport of proteins across cellular membranes. HSP70
can also prevent caspase-independent apoptosis pathways. HSP70 prevents cell death
under conditions in which caspase activation does not occur, because of the addition of
exogenous caspase inhibitors. HSP70 has also been shown to act at the premitochondrial

stage by inhibiting stress-activated kinases. (Schmitt, 2007)

Extracellular HSP 70

Aside from the known intracellular function of HSP's, there were numerous
reports showing their extracellular function thru its presence in blood and interaction with
the plasmalemma. There was an early evidence of its extracellular function during 1980s
when researchers observed that HSPs were transferred from glial cells to axons and was

then to be released from cultured cells. (Browne et al. 2007)

At present, even if its extracellular function is still uncertain, there were studies
which observed that HSPs can be internalized and imported in both cytoplasmic and
nuclear compartments of the cell and has the capability to promote survival.( Robinson,

2005)

Mechanism of action of HSP 70

Hsp 70 homologs consist of an N-terminal ATPase domain of 45kDa and a C-
terminal substrate-binding domain of ca. 25 kDa which is further subdivided into a B-
sandwich subdomain of 15 kDa and a C-terminal a-helical subdomain. The sequence
alignment of Hsp 70 protein sequence reveals a number of differences that may translate
into functional differences. The ATPase cycle of hsp 70 consists of an alternation
between the ATP state with low affinity and fast exchange rates for substrates, and the

ADP state with high affinity and low exchange rate for substrates. (Mayer, 2005)

CHAPTER III

COMPARATIVE PERFORMANCE OF GESTATING SOWS WITH DIFFERENT
PARITIES HOUSED WITH AND WITHOUT EVAPORATIVE
COOLING SYSTEM AT DIFFERENT BATCHES.

ABSTRACT

The study aimed to identify the effects of housing improvement and parity on sow
productivity performance. The sow performance records for February-November were
utilized. Records were divided into three batches, based on the month the sows were
bred: February-March, April-June and July. In each batch, two groups of sows were
selected, one held in conventional housing while the other housed with evaporative
cooling system (ECS). They were further grouped based on their parity levels: early (1*-
2"), mid (3" to 5) and late (6 and above). The temperature Humidity Index (THI)
values during gestation period were 73-79 and 76-83, 78-87 for first, second and third
batch, respectively. Based on the interaction effects, it could be concluded that late parity
sows from batch 1 greatly benefited from ECS in terms of WS] (4.91 vs 8.5d). For batch 2
sows, the TPB (12.0vs9.15) and LSBA (11.2vs8.46) of late parity sows were also

improved with the use of ECS.

Results also showed that ECS housed sows for batch 1 had shorter WSI and
heavier birth weight (BW) of piglets (P<0.05), Meanwhile, ECS housed sows for batch 2

had the thicker back fat at weaning (BFTW) (P<0.05). Batch Ilate parity sows were


found to have higher litter size bon alive (LSBA) and total pigs born (TPB) while mid
parity sows from the same batch had thicker back fat at farrowing (BFTF), BFTW,
heavier BW of piglets and shorter WSI (P<0.05). On the other hand, batch 2 mid parity
sows had higher LSBA, litter size at weaning (LSW), TPB and heaviest BW and weaning
weight (WWT ) of piglets (P<0.05). Batch 2 early and late parity sows had thicker
BFTW. Lastly, batch 3 mid parity sows had the heaviest WWT of piglets while late

parity sows had the shortest WSI (P<0.05)


Introduction

As of January 1, 2015, there is 1.68% increase in swine inventory from 11.80
million heads last year to 12 million heads. There is a 1.64% and 1.75% increase in the
stocks of backyard and commercial farm, respectively (BAS, 2015). However, sow
productivity in terms of pigs produced (sold) per sow per year has minimal improvement
for the past several years. Swine farms in the country had a range of only 13.16-21.02
pigs produce (sold) per sow per year, with an average of 18.23 (Calud et al., 2014)

Several factors may be attributed to this minimal improvement in swine
production; this may include nutrition, management, breed, parity, diseases, lactation
length, season and global climate change experienced mostly by backyard raisers in the
tropics.

Climatic factors were one of the constraints of pig production in Asia, according
to Huynh et al. (2007), this region falls within the equatorial climatic zone stretching
from 5° to 23° latitude north of the equator, which was characterized, by high temperature
and high humidity. This combination of high temperature and humidity has unfavorable
effects on animal housing and environmental protection constituting a complication for
pig raising,

Hot weather causes reduction in feed consumption and lower conception in
breeding herd.. However, pigs are only able to cool themselves thru the evaporative heat
loss because they cannot dissipate enough moisture from the skin. Among all the other
signs of heat stress in pigs, panting is the first to be observed. Thus, the provision of

adequate amount of water for drinking is needed as a first line of defense against heat


stress. If the temperature remains above 26.7°C substantial losses in performance and
reproduction efficiency may result (Lammers et al. (2007).

In this case, evaporative cooling system (ECS) may be an effective strategy of
cooling pigs. ECS is one of the methods employed to reduce heat stress in livestock and
poultry. It is an adiabatic humidification process that does not involve heat gain or loss
because sensible heat of the air is used to evaporate the water that comes in contact with
the air. The sensible heat is then converted to latent heat in the added vapour, resulting in
a reduction of the dry bulb temperature with a complementary increase of the relative
humidity and water vapour content of the air (Mersma and Short 1963 & Simmons and
Lott, 1996 as cited by Lucas et al., 2000).

There are several studies, which documented the benefits of ECS or tunnel-
ventilated facilities. One of these studies includes the study of Lally (1999) on the
comparison of the performance of pigs housed in natural ventilated facilities and tunnel
ventilated facilities, They were able to observe superior performance of pigs housed in
tunnel-ventilated facilities in terms of daily feed consumption and feed conversion.
Kiefer et al. (2012), on the other hand, was able to observe increased feed intake, reduced
total percent of weight loss, increased weight of piglets and litters at weaning and
improve daily milk production of sows because of air-cooling. Therefore, this study
would like to compare the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) in houses with and
without ECS together with the sows’ productivity performances from February to
October 2014. However, this study was limited to tropical environment, commercial

breed performed in only one commercial farm in three batches throughout the year.


Materials and Methods

Time and location of the study

The study was conducted at an accredited swine breeder farm at Rizal from
February to November 2014. The farm used in the study had all ECS houses converted
from the non-ECS houses established in 1980’s. And throughout the period of
experiment, we were able to gather 3 batches of sow performance data based on the

months that they were bred as listed in the farm records.

Housing and Parity classification

Housing and parity were the two factors for this study. The sows were housed
randomly in ECS or non-ECS gestating house based on farm management.

Aside from the effect of housing, effect of parity was also considered in this study
in each batch. The sows (regardless of housing) were classified based on their parity
level. The classifications are: early (1* and 2™), mid (3" to 5'*) and late (6 and above)
parities.

A. Batch 1
1. Experimental animals
Housing as treatment. Sows from batch 1 (n=91) were bred between
February to March 2014. These sows were further divided into two, sows housed

in ECS (n= 49) and sows in non-ECS (n=42).


Parity as treatment. These 91 sows were further classified based on their
parity levels: early parity sows (n=44), mid-parity sows (34) and late parity sows

(n=13)

2. Management of animals

Figure 6. Management timeline for Batch 1 sows

Sows from batch 1 were bred between February and March 2014 and on their
gestation period from April- July 2014, They farrowed between (the last week of) July
2014 and August 2014.

All the sows were first housed in the non- ECS pens, which they called the house
for the dry sows. Once they were already in heat (estrus) they will be bred, in the same
pen (non-ECS), and will just be randomly transferred to either ECS or non-ECS gestating
pens once they were confirmed pregnant. However, as part of farm’s management during
summer (March to May) the sows were housed in ECS for only 60 days and will then be
transferred to the non- ECS house for 47 days during their late gestation period.

Meanwhile, sows that were housed in non-ECS since the beginning of their gestation

period, stayed in the non-ECS for 107 days. One week before expected date of farrowing,

all the sows were transferred in the sow-litter pens that were equipped with ECS.

B. BATCH 2
1, Experimental animals
Housing as treatment. Sows from this batch (n=98) were bred between April to
June 2014. They were also divided into two based on their housing; ECS housed sows
(n= 29) and non- ECS (n=69)
Parity as treatment. These 98 sows were divided based on their parity levels also:
early (n=25), mid (n=55) and late (18).

2. Management timeline

Figure 7, Management timeline for Batch 2 sows

Sows from batch 2 were bred between April and May 2014 and on their gestation
period from June to September 2014, They farrowed between September to October
2014.


The management timeline for this batch is similar with that of batch 1. The sows
were still first housed in the non- ECS house prior to transferring in either ECS or non-
ECS house. And since the sows were bred during summer months, the sows that were
initially housed in ECS house, stayed there for only 60 days, and after that were
transferred in non- ECS house for 47 days. The housing management for the sows that
were initially at non- ECS was still the same with those from batch 1 sows. Both groups
of sow, from ECS and non-ECS, were transferred to ECS house one week prior to

farrowing,

C. BATCH3
1. Experimental animals

Housing as treatment. Sows from this batch (n=77) were bred on July 2014. They
were also divided into two based on their housing; ECS housed sows (n= 46) and non-
ECS (n=31)

Parity as treatment. These 77 sows were divided based on their parity levels also:

early (n=21), mid (n=40) and late (16).

Figure 8, Management timeline for Batch 3 sows

Sows from batch 3 were bred on July 2014 and on their gestation period from
August to November 2014. They farrowed on November 2014.

The management timeline for batch 3 was different from the previous batches.
For this batch, the sows were still first housed in the non- ECS house prior to transferring
in either ECS or non- ECS house, However, the selected sows in ECS stayed there for

107 days of their gestation period. They were not transferred in non-ECS house after 60

days compared with the previous batches. The sows that were initially housed in non-

ECS gestating house remained in there for 107 days also.

Other management practices
Different batches have different management timeline but the feeding and other
management practices applied to the animals for both treatments in different batches were

similar.


Data gathering

RHT20* data logger was installed at the center and at the level of the sows in the
selected houses for the monitoring of Relative Humidity (RH) and Temperature (T).
Monthly collection of data from the data logger was done. THI was graphed for better
comparison of data between different houses.

The Temperature Humidity Index (THI) was computed based on the formula
from NOAA, 1976 and was used by Botto et al. (2013):
THI = 0.8T. + (RH/100) x (Ts-14.3) + 46.4
Where:
Ta - ambient temperature (°C)
RH - relative humidity (%)

The performance records of the experimental sows were used as basis for
analyzing sow productivity in the given period. Reproductive performance of sows that
were assessed include total pigs born (TPB), litter size at birth (LSBA), litter size at
weaning (LSW), number of born dead (BD) which was the total of still born, mummified
and small bor piglets, birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WWT), backfat before
farrowing (BFTF), backfat at weaning (BFTW), back fat loss (A BFT) and weaning to
service interval (WSI).

Ultrasonic device was used in the farm to measure the back fat thickness of sows.
It was placed on three points: shoulder (above the elbow joint; approximately midback),

last rib and on the loin, The average of the three backfat locations were used in this study.


Statistical Analysis

Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was done using PROC GLM of SAS
(Cary USA). The statistical design for this study was 2x3 Factorial in Complete
Randomized Design (2 housing and 3 parity levels)

The values obtained in the measurement procedures were presented in
Mean+SEM and comparison of means between and within different factors was done
using Least Significant Difference LSD. Some of the parameters in the study did not fit
the normal distribution as observed in the normal probability plot depicted in the software
and the required square root transformation were accomplished before the statistical

analysis.

A. BATCH 1

1. Temperature Hu

Index (THI)

Sows from batch 1 were bred during February and March which was normally a
cold season having THI of 73.31 (ECS Feb) and 75.23 (Non-ECS Feb), while THI during
March range from (73.97-76.49) for ECS house, and (76.05-79.28) for Non-ECS house.

They were observed from farrowing to weaning, which was from February to June,


2. Sow Productivity Performance

Different reproductive performances of the sows were observed in the study.
These include the following: litter size born alive (LSBA), litter size at weaning (LSW),
total pigs born (TPB), number of born dead (BD), birth weight (BW) and weaning weight
of piglets, back fat at farrowing (BFTF), back fat at weaning (BFTW), back fat loss and
weaning to service interval (WSI).

Based on Table 1, housing did not significantly affect LSBA, LSW, TPB and BD.
It can be observed that even if the TPB (10.26) from non-ECS house was higher than
ECS house (10.02) (P>0.05), the number of BD from non ECS (0.68) was also higher
than ECS (P>0.05) thus higher number of LSBA was observed in ECS house (9.49) than
non ECS house (9.40) although not significant. Higher LSW was also observed in non

ECS house (8.69) but was still not significant than ECS house (8.63)


Parity, on the other hand, significantly affects LSBA and TPB. Highest TPB
(12.30) and LSBA (11.46) was observed from late parity sows. LSBA and TPB from
early parity sows (9.77 and 9.0) and mid parity sows (9.26 and 9.0) were almost
comparable. Even if late parity sows had higher LSW (9.23) compare with sows from
early (8.82) and mid (8.23) its difference from other sows were not significant. Parity
levels did not also significantly affect the number of born dead even if sows from 3 to
5 parity levels (0.38) had the least number of bom dead compared with early (0.57) and

late parity sows (0.69)

Results from Table 2 showed that sows from ECS house had significantly heavier
birth weight of piglets (1.51) than non-ECS sows (1.41). Heavier WWT was also
observed from ECS sows (7.86 kg vs 7.52 kg) although not significant. BFTF and BFTW
of sows from ECS and non-ECS house were also comparable. ECS house sows had
BFTF of 20.51 mm while non ECS had 18.88 mm. Higher BFTW was also observed
from ECS sows (17.86 mm) but still not significant from non ECS housed sows (15.55
mm). Non-ECS sows had BFT loss of 3.33 mm while ECS sows had 2.65 mm only. On
the other hand, WSI was significantly shortened by housing. WSI of sows from ECS
house was 0.76 day shorter than those from ECS house (4.53 vs 5.29)

Parity significantly affects BW, BFTF and BFTW. Among all parity levels it can
be observed that mid parity sows had significantly heavier BW of piglets (1.59 kg),
thicker BFTF (21.59 mm) and BFTW (18.38 mm). Significant loss of 3.39 mm, 3.21 mm
and 0.92 mm was observed from early, mid and late parity sows, respectively. Shortest
WEI among parity classification was observed from mid parity (4.50 d), which was 0.96
day significantly shorter than late parity and 0.50 day shorter than early parity.

An interaction effect of housing and parity in WSI was observed in the study.
Based on Table 3, influence of housing was observed in all parity levels. Non-ECS sows
had significantly longer WSI (6.25 d) than ECS sows (4.624). Significantly shorter WSI
was observed from sows in mid parity, which was 1.98 days shorter than late parity sows.
Shortest WSI was observed in mid parity sows (4.33 days) confined in ECS house while

sows from non ECS house during their late parity had the longest WSI of 8.5 days

B. BATCH 2
1. Temperature Humidity Index

Sows from batch 2 were bred during April to June which was summer season
having THI of 73.32 (ECS April) and 79.12 (Non-ECS April), while THI during May
range from (78.92-79.97) for ECS house, and (81.43-82.67) for Non-ECS house. THI for
June range from (78.93-80.46) for ECS house and (80.45-81.98) in non-ECS house.

Observation for this batch was from April- October 2014.

however it is still not significant (P>0.05) with the values from non-ECS house sows

However, parity significantly differs in LSBA, LSW and TPB. Mid parity sows
(3" to 5) had higher LSBA (9.80) , LSW (9.18) and TPB (10.60) compared with early

and late parity sows. Number of born dead was comparable for each parity levels.

Higher BW (1.48) and WWT (7.80) of piglets were observed in Table 5, from
sows in ECS house although not significant with non ECS sows house that had 1.42 kg
and 7.41 kg for BW and WWT, respectively. Housing also did not significantly affect
BFTF with sows from non-ECS having 18.50 mm and ECS sows with 18.10mm.
However, it significantly affect BFTW wherein thicker BFTW was observed from ECS
sows (17.37 mm) compared with non-ECS sows (16.89 mm). ECS did not significantly
affect WSI (6.10d vs 5.92)

Difference of BFT from ECS sows was 0.73 mm, while non-ECS sows had 1.61
BFT loss from farrowing to weaning. Thus it can be observed that sows from non-ECS
had higher loss of BFT compared with ECS sows.

On the other hand, different parity levels significantly affect BW, WWT and
BFTW. Piglets with heavier BW (1.50 kg) and WWT (7.76 kg) were observed from mid
parity sows. Early and late parity sows had 1.32 kg and 1.46 kg BW and 6.86 and 7.73 kg
WWT of piglets, respectively. However, parity did not affect the BFTF of sows even if
thicker BFTF was observed from sows in mid parity (18.85mm) compared with the BFTF
of early and later parity sows, which were 18.04 mm and 17.44 mm, respectively.
Significant BFTW between parity levels was observed in the study wherein late parity
sows had thicker BFTW (17.61 mm) compared with 17.52 mm and 16.64 mm from early
and mid parity sows respectively. Difference of BFT from farrowing to weaning was 0.52
mm, 2.21 mm and 0.17 mm for early, mid and late parity sows, respectively. Parity also
did not significantly affect the WSI even if the late parity sows had the shortest WSI

(5.17 d) compared with mid (6.2d) and early partity sows (6.0d).

Table 6 showed that sows from non-ECS house had the least BFTW (16.94)
compared with ECS sows that had 19.38 mm BFTW (P<0.05). On the other hand, early
parity sows had significantly thicker BFTW (20.35 mm) compared with mid (16.47mm)
and late parity sows (17.67 mm). Significant interaction effect of housing and parity was
also observed in this study wherein thickest BFTW among parity levels and housing was

observed in the early parity from ECS house with 24.5 mm.

Significant interaction effect of housing on TPB was observed from early and late parity
sows confined in ECS. Lower number of TPB was observed from early parity sows
housed in ECS (5.75) while highest TPB was from late parity sows confined in ECS

house.

Housing and parity influenced the LSBA of the sows. As shown in Table 8,
higher LSBA was observed from late parity sows (9.83) which was significantly higher
than early parity sows (7.09) and was comparable with mid parity sows (9.81).
Significant interaction effect of housing and parity was observed in the study wherein
lower LSBA was observed from early parity sows that were housed in ECS (5.75), while

higher LSBA was from late parity sows (11.2) that were also housed in ECS.


C. BATCH3
1. Temperature Humidity Index

All sows from batch 3 were bred during July, THI (83.4-85.46) for ECS and
(85.3-87.75) for non-ECS. THI for August were 83.58-85.16 and 85.49-87.53,
respectively for ECS and non-ECS. THI of 84.45 and 85.62 on the other hand were
observed for ECS and non-ECS during 1* week of September. They were observed until
November 2014, however there were missing data from 2™ week of September up to the
last week of November due to some technical problem with the data logger used during
the observation.
2. Sow Productivity Performance

Based on Table 9, it can be observed that any of the two treatments did not have
significant effect on LSBA, LSW, TPB and BD although consistently ECS obtained
favorable values in all parameters.

It can be observed that ECS sows had higher TPB (11.13) than non-ECS sows
(9.71). Higher number of LSBA was still observed from ECS sows (10.48) compared
with non-ECS sows (8.68). LSW for ECS (9.35) is 0.55 higher than non-ECS house
(8.77) but still failed to obtain significant difference.

Parity levels did not also have significant effect on any parameters given in the
table above. However, higher LSBA was observed from late parity sows (10.63)
compared with early and mid-parity sows with 8.52 and 10.05, respectively. Comparable
LSW was also observed having 8.58, 9.38 and 9.19 for early, mid and late parities,
respectively. Higher TPB (10.75) was observed from late parity sows but still not

significant with early and_—mid-parity sows (9.62) and_—_(10.75)

Table 10 showed that housing did not affect any of the parameters observed in the
given table. The BW (1. 46 kg) and WWT (1.38 kg) of piglets from ECS sows were not
significantly different with those from non-ECS sows. Thicker BFTF (20.00 mm) and
BFTW (16.92 mm) were observed from ECS sows but still not significant from the non-
ECS sows with 16.16 mm and 14.68 mm for their BFTF and BFTW respectively. BFT
loss of 3.08 mm from ECS sows while 1.48 mm lost from non-ECS sows were observed
during this period. WSI of 4.96 was observed from sows housed in ECS but still not
significant with those from non ECS house sows (5.48 d)

Heavier BW from late parity sows (1.52 kg) was observed but still not significant
with early and mid parity sows having piglets’ BW of 1.32 and 1.45 kg, respectively.
Similar to housing, the parity did not affect the BFTF and BFTW of sows, even if higher
BFTF (20.63 mm) and BFTW (17.50 mm) were observed from late parity sows. The BFT
loss from farrowing to weaning were 1.52 mm, 2.65 mm and 3.13 mm for early, mid and
late parity levels, respectively. In this case the late parity sows had the highest BFT loss.

However, parity had significant effect on the WWT of piglets. Heaviest WWT
was observed from mid parity sows (8.53 kg), although comparable with that of late
parity sows (8.06 kg), it was still significantly different from early parity sows. (7.76kg).
Shortest WSI was observed from late parity sows (4.88 d) although comparable with late

parity sows (4.95d). The early parity sows had the longest WSI, which was 5.81 days.


DISCUSSION

Reproductive performance of the sows observed in different period during this
study will be discussed further in this manuscript, But the limitation of the study is that
sow performances per batch were independently analyzed because of different
management during the periods when the sows were observed. The animals utilized in the
different batches (1, 2 and 3) were also different. Likewise the THI of the ECS and non-
ECS were not the same across the season. Unexpectedly the THI increases from February
to September in ECS and higher and increasing THI was recorded in non-ECS. Therefore

it is not valid to compare the different batches statistically.

A. BATCH I

1. Temperature Humidity Index

Temperature above 22°C is an indicator of heat stress, however temperature
explains climatic effects insufficiently that is why the THI was developed as heat stress
indicator (Lambertz, 2013). The range of the safest THI values for pigs must be 74 below
(THI<74). THI value within the range of 74 to 79 (74<THI<79) is considered critical,
while a value 79 to 84 (79STHI<84) is considered dangerous for pigs. Emergency
situation for pigs is declared if the THI value reaches and or exceeds the value of 84
(THI>84) (Botto et al., 2013).

Using the range given by Botto et al. (2013), it can be observed that based on the
computed THI on weekly average, only the first two weeks of observation for the house

with ECS is considered to have a safe THI value (73.31 and 73.97) for sows. The THI


during observation of batch 1 sows ranged from safe to critical condition, which can

affect their sow productivity performance for this period.

a. Effect of housing. Soltwedel et al. (2003) cited some of the beneficial effects of ECS
in the reproductive performance of sows, these include increase in litter weaning weight,
lower pre-weaning mortality, reduced sow weight loss during lactation. However, the

current study observed that housing only affect WSI and BW for this batch of sows.

Total pigs born (TPB), Litter size born alive (LSBA),) and litter size at weaning
(LSW) and number of born dead (BD). Numbers of TPB, LSBA, LSW and BD were
comparable for both houses. The result of the study was congruent with the result of Liao
(2006) wherein he evaluated different reproductive performances of sows from ECS
(water pad cooling barn) and non ECS house all throughout gestation and found out no
significant effect on litter size at birth, litter size born alive and litter size at weaning.

Comparable parameters between the two housing system for all batches can be
due high variances to their management (Figure 6). As stated in the materials and
methods of the study, the sows were first bred in an open type conventional house before
they were transfer to either ECS or non-ECS after confirmed pregnant (about 21 d). Thus,
sows from two groups were exposed to heat stress prior to breeding and transfer to
selected houses, it can be assumed that the number of embryos developed in sows in ECS.
and non ECS houses were comparable because both experience early gestational stress.

Hence litter size were the same for ECS and non-ECS

Sl

Bloemhof, et. al. (2013) observed that heat stress during two weeks post-mating
has a negative effect on conception rate and the number of viable embryos. It was also
stated that stress incurred on 10" day post-mating negatively affects the total number of
pigs born and the litter size born alive. This is mainly because this is the period when
pregnancy recognition and implantation of embryos occur.

Romanini (2008) reported that heat stress imposed within three weeks after post
mating caused a decrease in conception rates. A decrease on the farrowing rates and litter
size of sows exposed to temperature >35°C vs sows exposed to temperature < 30°C
during summer months was observed by Almond and Bilkei (2005). Negative effects of
increase in temperature and humidity was also reported by Suriyasomboon (2006), who
also stated that at temperature >31°C, the 10% increase in RH is equivalent to a 1°C rise
in air temperature and heat stress can negatively affect follicular growth resulting in

decreased number of ovulations and/ or increase early embryonic death.

In the current study, batch 1 sows only stay at ECS for 60 days and was
transferred to non-ECS. In this case, they might still experience heat stress during their
late pregnancy. However, according to Romanini (2008) litter size was not affected if the
heat stress is imposed during middle and late pregnancy, which means that whether the
sows in the current study were in ECS or non-ECS during their late gestation it would not

have any effect in their litter size.

Early gestational stress in non-ECS (21 d to transfer to ECS) and a week before

farrowing transfer of all sows to ECS sow-litter pen may have contributed to the


comparable litter size and number of pigs born dead. At early gestation period number of
embryos formed were the same for all sows and similarly one week before farrowing all
sows experience the same condition at sow-litter pen with ECS. According to Lambertz,

2013 the critical stage of gestating sows to stress is at early and late period.

Birth weight (BW) and weaning weight (WWT) of piglets. The birth weight was
significantly affected by housing. Results (Table 2) showed that, sows in ECS house
produce heavier piglets as compared to the sows from non-ECS even if they both
experience the same condition during the middle and late period of gestation. This could
be attributed to the heat stress being experienced by the sows in non-ECS condition from
the beginning of the gestation period which in turn causes reduce in feed intake thereby
causing reduce energy intake.

It is during the middle and late gestation period where maximum fetal growth
happens (Greenwood, 2012). For this batch, ECS housed sows only stay there for 60 days
and then after that they were transfer in Non-ECS house. ECS housed sows were only
affected by heat stress, specifically the reduction in feed intake, during their late gestation
period unlike for the sows that were in non- ECS house which have experienced the heat
stress from the beginning to late gestation. This suggests that sows from non-ECS have
incurred significant loss in their body weight, hence unable to satisfy their own nutrient
requirement, and the fetal growth and development of their litter depends on sows’
nutritional reserve as evidenced by having significant effect on BW favorable for sows

exposed to ECS from early to mid gestation.


Weaning to service interval (WSI). Sows are expected to return to estrus within 3
to 7 days after weaning but due to the increase in temperature there is also an increase in
the weaning to service interval (WSI) (Williams, 2009; Black et al. 1993). In the current
study, ECS house had lower THI (72 - 76); therefore we can assume that sows from ECS
house should have shorter WSI compared with sows from non-ECS house. Significant
differences in WSI were observed (Table 2) wherein ECS sows’ WSI were 0.76 day
shorter than non-ECS sows. As stated in the Figure 6 the batch 1 sows were bred
between last week of February to March 2014 which was the time when there was the
lowest THI observed in the study. The time that the sows were bred could only be
classified from safe to dangerous situation, which might cause minimal heat stress, most

especially to those sows that were housed in ECS.

Results of the recent study was congruent with the study of Also, sows that
farrowed in the warm season (May through October) returned to estrus 5.08 d after
weaning compared with 4.38 d for cool season (November through April) sows (Dove
and Haydon, 1994).

Moreover, the significant differences in WSI could be attributed to the sufficient
energy reserve of sows for the next pregnancy. Heat stress causes decline in the feed
intake of sows in order to decrease the body heat production. Likewise, sows under stress
utilize their body reserves for maintenance requirements, Therefore, sows from non-ECS
housed had relatively higher weight loss due to reduction in feed intake as reflected in

apparent greater BFT loss.


Relationship of reduction in feed intake, decrease in follicular growth and
increase in WSI as a result of higher temperature was documented in several studies
Prolonged WSI due to hot weather was stated by Suriyasomboon et al. (2006) to be partly
associated with reduction of appetite, protein deficiency and feed allowance limitation
during lactation. Gourdine et al. (2006) reported that the inadequate nutrient intake of
sow during lactation affect the secretion of luteinizing hormone at 14 days after
farrowing which might influenced the WSI of sows. The change in ambient temperature
and photoperiod influence the weaning to service intervals through its effects on the

hypothalmohypophyseal-ovarian axis. (Boma et al., 2006)

Knox and Zas (2001) found that sows that had WEI of 3 days had 1.0 mm
increase in the ovarian follicles’ diameter compared to those that had WEI of 4 days
9.6mm vs 8.6mm) Tokach et al. (1992), on the other hand,observed higher LH
concentrations for sows that had WEI of 3 days. These results were supported by
Williams (2009), who stated that there should be an increase in LH concentration so that

large follicles may be present at WEL

Gourdine et al. (2006) observed that season has more impact on insemination or
gestation success in sows that have experienced lactation than in gilts at first breeding.
Reduce feed intake inhibits LH secretion during lactation and affect follicle development
which then resulted to lesser ovulation rate, impaired quality of follicular oocytes and

follicular fluid which explained why there is high embryonic mortality and and decreased


LS at farrowing. Thus, higher body weight and back fat thickness at farrowing decreased

the risk of having prolonged WE].

Backfat at farrowing (BFTF), back fat at weaning (BFTW), back fat loss. Back
fat thickness in pigs is an important factor to consider in swine production because it
affects reproductive performance of sows namely puberty attainment, total piglets born,
farrowing rate, and weaning to estrous interval (Gourdine et al., 2006; Roongsitthichai et.
al, 2014). In this study it was observed that there was no significant effect of housing on
BFTF and BFTW although there was apparent greater backfat loss from non-ECS sows
compared with ECS.

Result of the study was congruent with the results of several studies, which
showed an increase in BFT loss as the sows were exposed to elevated temperature.
Williams (2009) observed that heat stressed sows had greater back fat lost with the
thermoneutral sows (3.35mm vs 1.15mm). Meanwhile, Dove and Haydon (1994)
reported a 1.58 mm backfat loss in sows during the hot season compared with the sows in
warm season.

Roongsitthichai et. al, (2014) stated that back fat is an essential source of leptin,
insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and progesterone (Ps), these are hormones which are
related to the attainment of puberty in gilts. These hormones are also regulators of
cellular growth and differentiation and responsible for the onset of puberty and body

composition.


Cechova and Tyrdon (2006) observed that sows with thicker backfat had better
litter performance. They were able to observe a positive association between increase in
backfat thickness and number of parities. Their analysis confirmed that sow fertility
increased linearly. Meanwhile, Danko et al. (20150 stated that the maintenance of
adequate body tissue reserves in the sow’s lifetime is of importance to be able to
maximize herd productivity.

According to Trezona, et. al. (2004), seasonal pattern exists in the back fat
thickness of the pigs. High temperature will reduce the average back fat, and vice versa.
Heat stressed pigs have thinner back fat as compared to pigs raised in a normal condition.
Backfat and loin muscle area are two measurements that indicate nutrient mobilization

during lactation that may be altered by heat stress.

b. Effect of parity. Killen et al. (1992) stated that reproductive performance is also
influenced by parity. Parity affected ovulation rate with primiparous sows having 14.7
corpora lutea and second and third parity sows having 17.1 and 21.4 corpora lutea,
respectively. All the reproductive parameters studied by Tantasuparuk et al (2000) were
all significantly affected by parity. The current study on the other hand, found out that

parity affect WSI, LSBA, TPB, BFTF, BFTW and BW of piglets for batch | data.

Total pigs born (TPB), Litter size born alive (LSBA),) and litter size at weaning
(LSW) and number of born dead (BD). \n the study, we observed higher number of TPB

and LSBA in the late parity sows. Farrowing rate and litter size is supposed to increase


as parity increases, and the highest levels were observed from parity 3 to 5 (Koketsu et
al., 1999 as cited by Hoving et al., 2010). The increase in litter size from parities 1
through 4-5 might be explained by increase in ovulation rate, uterine capacity and age of
sows (Suriyasombon et al., 2006).

No significant differences in LSW were observed but Knecht et al. (2015)
observed a significant effect of parity on number of pigs weaned. On the other hand,
there are several studies that associated number of born of dead with back fat thickness
and parity level. According to Roongsitthichai et al. (2010), those with high backfat
thickness could farrow a great number of still born that mostly come from primiparous
sows with backfat thickness, at first mating, of 18.0-23.0 mm than that from those with
backfat thickness, at first mating, of 10.0-15.0 mm (8.740.83% vs 5.5+0.61%).
Meanwhile, Tarres et al. (2006) relate litter size at weaning with parity level and back fat
thickness. According to them gilts with low backfat thickness (<16 mm at the end of the
growth test) produced litter size at weaning less than 7.5 piglets. The literatures cited
showed the relationship of parity and back fat thickness with that of the litter size and

mortality.

Birth weight (BW) and weaning weight (WWT) of piglets Weaning weight is
directly proportional to body weight (Berard et al., 2008). However, in the study, it was
observed that there were significant differences in birth weigh but not in weaning weight
wherein mid parity had the heaviest birth weight of piglets. Knecht et al. (2015) observed

that gilts and first parity sows had the lowest birth weight of piglets, while sows from 3


and 4" had the heaviest BW, which is similar with the current result. Insignificant result
of weaning weight could be attributed to different factors like season and breed, which
has the strongest influenced on weaning weight and piglet birth (Kencht et al. 2015), and

nutrition should be considered.

Weaning to service interval (WSI). According to Gourdine (2006) first parity
sows are more prone to reproductive problems during the hot season with higher
proportion of primiparous sows with delayed WSI at 26°C than in higher parities.
Although in warm season return to estrus is similar in multiparous and primiparous sows.
Primiparous sows experienced a greater rate of infertility (33.4%), or not returning to
estrus within 14 d of weaning, following their first lactation compared with subsequent
lactations (17.6%) (Maclean, 1969; Williams, 2009)

In the current study, for first batch of data on which the breeding period was
during cold season and gestation period was on summer months, significant difference
was observed between late and mid parity sows only. Results showed that late parity
sows had the longest WSI, which was comparable with the early parity sows. However,
early parity sows were supposed to have the longest WSI among parity levels.

First parity sows are sensitive to body reserve depletion because they do not have
‘enough body reserves at first farrowing and insufficient feed capacity to fulfill energy
needs during lactation. Young sows still need to grow to reach maturity. Lack of body

Teserves and desire to grow make the young sows more sensitive to negative effect of


energy balance on reproduction (Everts, 1994; Everts and Dekker, 1995; Prunier et al.,
2003 as cited by Hoving et al., 2010)

Sows in their 1* and 2™ parity had a higher weight loss and were found to have
significantly 2.7 days longer WSI than sows with relatively low weight loss (9.5vs 6.8
days) (Tantasuparuk et al., 2001).

Interaction effect of parity and housing in WSI. Significant interaction effect of
housing and parity in WSI was observed. Early, mid and late parity sows from ECS
house had improved WSI compared with sows from non-ECS. It could also be observed
that late parity sows from February to April 2014 greatly benefited from ECS based on
having 3.59 day shorter WSI compared from late parity sows in non-ECS.

Gourdine et al., 2006 stated that the probability for the primiparous sow to have a
prolonged weaning to conception interval (WCI) was almost 4 times higher when
weaning occurred during the hot than in warm, the effect was more than 2.5 times higher
in multiparous sows. More multiparous sows were inseminated less than 7 days

compared with primiparous sows in the experiment of Cox et al. (1983).

Backfat at farrowing (BFTF), back fat at weaning (BFTW), back fat loss.
Skorjanc et al. (2007) observed that, first-farrowing sows produced significantly fewer
live-born piglets, had markedly thinner backfat in late gestation, showed significant loss
of backfat thickness during lactation and showed thinner backfat at weaning than sows
with a greater number of parities. The primiparous and multiparous sows with thicker

backfat at farrowing also had thicker backfat at weaning. Sows with thicker backfat at


weaning showed a shorter weaning-to-estrus interval and this correlation was higher for

primiparous than for multiparous sow

In the study, mid parity sows had significantly thicker BFTF and BFTW. The

study found that early parity sows had higher BFT loss compared with the other sows.

De rensis (2005) observed that sows having greater back fat depths at farrowing
also have more backfat loss during lactation. .He also observed that back fat loss during
lactation was also positively associated with weaning to estrus interval but was negatively
associated with pregnancy rate. However, Maes, (2004) observed that sows that had
higher backfat loss after gestation were found to have significantly higher percentage of

stillborn piglets.

B. BATCH 2

1. Temperature Humidity Index

The range of THI for batch 2 was already in emergency situation based on the
range given by Botto et al. (2013). Thus, it could be concluded that sows during their
gestation period might be experiencing heat stress. Lambertz (2013) found out that
increased in THI values before farrowing had negative effects on the number of live bom.
piglets. However he also observed that increase THI values before farrowing reduced the
number of stillborn piglets, pre-weaning mortality and had positive effects on the number

of weaned piglets. Therefore, he concluded that higher THI values negatively affected

reproductive performance of sows but increased the piglets’ performance.


2. Sow productivity performance
a. Effect of housing

Total pigs born (TPB), Litter size born alive (LSBA),) and litter size at weaning
(LSW) and number of born dead (BD). Improvement in housing did not also have
significant effect on TPB, LSBA, LSW and BD for this batch. This was similar with the
previous batch, and we could also assumed that their management system play a big role
in this result. For this batch, sows from two groups were exposed in heat stress prior to
breeding and transfer to selected houses that was a critical stage during gestation, which
affected their reproductive efficiency.

Being exposed to heat stress during the first week of gestation might cause
disordered implantation of embryos, reduced conception rates and reduced number of
vital embryos (Lambertz, 2013). Since both group of sows were already exposed in heat
stress during this critical stage of gestation, we expected less significant numbers on their
litter size.

Similar with the result of previous batch, housing did not have significant effect in
the number of born dead which could also be attributed to the transfer of all sows in the
sow-litter ECS house one week before farrowing thus both group of sows did not
experienced heat stress prior to farrowing.

Birth weight (BW) and weaning weight (WWT) of piglets. Comparable BW for
batch 2 was observed and could be attributed to different factors. During this time, the
sows, either from ECS and non-ECS were all exposed to high THI, as shown by the THI

during the time that they were bred which was considered to be in emergency situation.


Although non-ECS has significantly higher THI, the degrees of stress apparently are the
same with ECS having THI beyond 75.

On the other hand, the study also found no significant effect of housing in WWT
on any of the sow performance data analyzed. Insignificant effect of WWT can be
attributed to the transfer of sows in ECS house one week prior to farrowing up to the day
of weaning. In this case, all sows were at ECS house and they all experienced same THI.

Weaning to service interval (WSI). Bloemhof et al. (2008) stated that when sows
are exposed to high temperature they respond with elevated blood plasma concentrations
of cortisol. Sows that failed to return to estrus had greater cortisol concentrations during.
lactation and after weaning had decreased luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion after
weaning than sows that returned to estrus directly after weaning.

However the study observed comparable WSI of sows for this batch which was
similar with the result of (Messias de Braganca et al., 1998) that observed no differences
in weaning-to-estrus intervals for heat- stressed sows. Weaning-to-estrus intervals were
variable and were not different between sows that were restricted or ad libitum fed in a
thermoneutral (20°C) environment.

Backfat at farrowing (BFTF), back fat at weaning (BFTW), back fat loss.
Physiological changes during farrowing and lactation were compounded by a change in
diet, post natal stress and microclimatic factors (Quesnel et al. 1999 cited by Knecht et al
2015). The study found no significant differences in the BFTF but significant effect of
housing in BFTW was observed. The BFTW from ECS housed sows were 0.48 mm

thicker compared with non-ECS. Significant difference on BFT was also observed by


Romanini et al. (2008), which were 14.9mm, and 14.5mm from ECS and non-ECS
housed sows, respectively.

The significant differences in BFTW could be attributed to the loss in body
weights and body reserves of sows that were in non-ECS, throughout their gestation
period, as a result of heat-induced reduction in feed intake. And reduction in body
reserves will result to thinner back fat. Meanwhile, ECS housed sows were able to
conserve their energy thereby conserving their body reserves. Higher back fat loss from

non-ECS sows proved that these sows had higher reduction in body reserve.

b. Effect of parity. Different parity levels for this batch had significant effect on TPB,
LSBA, BW, WWT and BFTW.

Total pigs born (TPB), Litter size born alive (LSBA),) and litter size at weaning
(LSW) and number of born dead (BD). Second batch of data showed higher TPB from
mid parity sows and higher LSBA from late parity sows. Results showed that even if the
mid parity sows had higher TPB, they had higher number of born dead compared with the
late parity sows, hence higher LSBA among sows from late parity. Result of the study
was similar with that of Quesnel et al (2008), wherein he found out that sows in I and
2"! parities had the homogenous litters because of having lower number of piglets bor.

due to less space for fetal development in the uterus

Interaction effect of housing and parity on TPB and LSBA. The study

found out that early parity sows from ECS had 24.5 mm BFTW, which was the thickest


BFTW among all the sows observed. Different literatures stated that primiparous sows
had higher tendency of losing more BFTW, but in this case, they were the one that had
the higher BFTW. This could be attributed to having the lowest TPB than sows at late
parity. It only means that, they only nursed few piglets thus less energy reduction during
lactation. Thus, early parity sows from ECS house were able to conserve more energy as
manifested by higher BFTF.

Based on Table 7 it can be observed that late parity sows obtained significantly
higher TPB by 1.85 when raised in ECS house while early parity sows obtained higher
‘TPB by 3.26 when also raised in ECS house. Based on Table 8, surprisingly early parity
sows is favored when housed in non-ECS. On the other hand, late parity sows performed
better when house with ECS based on the number of LSBA. Thus, it can be concluded
that TPB and LSBA of late parity sows were improved by 2.85 and 1.37, respectively,

with the use of ECS.

Birth weight (BW) and weaning weight (WWT) of piglets. Significantly higher
birth weight and weaning weight were observed from mid parity sows in this batch with
values of BW and WW of 1.50 kg and 7.76 kg,, respectively.

Weaning to service interval (WSI). The second batch of data, sows’ breeding and
gestation period both fall during summer months. Shortest WSI for second batch of data
was observed from early parity sows however, a comparable WSI was observed from mid
and late parity sows (Table 15). The result was different from other literatures that stated

that early parity sows were more prone to have longer WSI.


Sows with high relative weight loss (>15%) during lactation had significantly
longer weaning-to-service interval (WSI) than those with low relative weight loss (<8%)
(9.5 vs 6.8 days, p<0.05) (Tantasuparuk et al., 2001).This phenomenon is apparently
found in first and second parity sows; those in parity 1 and 2 with high relative weight
loss had WSI of 13.2 and 11.9 days, respectively, meanwhile those in parity 3 and 4 with
high relative weight loss had WSI of 6.4 and 6.5 days, respectively (Tantasuparuk et al.,
2001).

The lesser number of pigs born alive and thicker backfat at weaning can explain

contradictory result of our data.

Backfat at farrowing (BFTF), back fat at weaning (BFTW), back fat loss.

Even if there was no significant effect of parity on BFTF, there was a significant
effect on BFTW. It was observed that late parity sows had thicker BFTW compared with
early and mid parity sows. Meanwhile, mid parity sows were found to have the highest
backfat loss, and the least backfat loss was observed in early parity sows (0.52mm).
Surprisingly the late parity sows gained more BFT at weaning (+0.17). Comparable low
litter size of early and late parity sows was observed. Therefore greater backfat loss of
mid parity sows could be attributed to having the highest number of LSBA and heaviest
Bw.

Interaction effect of housing and parity on BFTW. Significant interaction effect
on BFTW was observed. This interaction effect implied that early parity sows from ECS

housed sows were able to conserve more energy as manifested by higher BFT which is


consistent to the previous discussion associated to litter size born alive and nursed
through weaning

C. BATCH3
1. Temperature Humidity Index
Based on the THI during this period, the batch 3 sows were already in emergency
situation. Thus, similar with batch 2 sows, it could be concluded that sows during their
gestation period experienced heat stress
2. Sow productivity performance

a, Effect of housing

Total pigs born (TPB), Litter size born alive (LSBA),) and litter size at weaning
(LSW) and number of born dead (BD). Sows from 3 batch experienced different
management system in terms of the length of stay in ECS during the gestation period but
still there was no significant effect of housing in the following parameters similar to the
study of Liao (2006).

In the current study, the result could be attributed to having high THI values
during this period from both houses. THI during these months in non-ECS house ranged
from 84-87.

There are numerous factors which may contribute in the seasonal reduction in
litter size which includes, increased embryonic mortality resulting from poor oocyte
developmental competence, reduced ovulation rate, reduced luteal function and reduced
boar fertility (Bertoldo, et. al. (2012).The increase in THI values before farrowing had

negative effects on number of live born piglets. At day 102"¢ to 110" of gestation, heat


stress causes less live born and more stillbom piglets. (Omtvedt et al., 1971; Lambertz
2013). Prunier et al. (1997) found out that piglet mortality was 0.7 pigs higher in heat

stressed sows at 27°C than in thermoneutral sows at 18°C (1.58 kg/d vs 2.15 kg/d).

Birth weight (BW) and weaning weight (WWT) of piglets. Result of the study
found comparable BW, in terms of the effect of housing, even if one group of sows were
already housed in the ECS throughout their gestation period. Similar with other batches,
this could be attributed to the management system, wherein during period of breeding
both group of sows were initially housed in non-ECS house. The THI during this period
was also in emergency situation already. Being in non-ECS house during this period
could cause them heat stress.

Comparable effect of WWT could be attributed to the transfer of sows in ECS
house | week prior farrowing up to the day of weaning. In this case, all sows were at ECS
condition and they all experienced same environmental condition.

However, different studies observed the effect of higher temperature in weaning
weight. Heat stressed sows reared piglets that have lesser weaning weight and growth
rate. Piglet weaning weight average was 5.84 kg when sows were exposed to 29°C
compared with an average of 6.89 kg for piglets from sows in an 18°C environment
(Quiniou and Noblet, 1999) Exposure to high ambient temperature was linked to the
lower body weight gain for piglets due to lesser milk production of sows. (Renaudeau

and Noblet, 2001; Williams, 2009)


Weaning to service interval (WSI)

The study found no significant differences in the WSI of sows from batch 3 in
different gestating houses. Since both group of sows were already in exposed in THI that
was considered to be in emergency situation, we assumed that both of them were already
exposed in heat stress. And as a consequence of heat stress, there might be a reduction in
feed intake in both groups that could affect the WSI of the sows. The result of the study
also implied that the THI >80 in an ECS house might not have effect in the improvement

of WSI of the sows.

Backfat at farrowing (BFTF), back fat at weaning (BFTW), back fat loss. No
significant differences on back fat were observed in the study even if higher back fat loss
was observed in the ECS sows. Having higher back fat loss, it could be assumed that the
sows housed in ECS were those in their early parity levels.

Sows with a thicker layer of back fat achieve better litter performance and more
litter in the course of their lives. The direct relationship of the back fat thickness of sows
with the number of parturitions indicates a positive effect on average longevity of sows.
This was supported by the analysis on the number of piglets bom alive and weaned
(Cechova and Tvrdon, 2006). Maintaining adequate body tissue reserves throughout a
sow’s lifetime is thought to be important to maximize herd productivity. (Danko et al,

2015)


According to Trezona, et. al. (2004), seasonal pattern exists in the back fat
thickness of the pigs. High temperature will reduce the average back fat, and vice versa
Heat stressed pigs have thinner back fat as compared to pigs raised in a normal condition.
Backfat and loin muscle area are two measurements that indicate nutrient mobilization
during lactation that may be altered by heat stress.

b. Effect of parity. Lastly, in the third batch of data parity only affect the WWT
and WSL

Birth weight (BW) and weaning weight (WWT) of piglets. Sows with parity from
3 to 5 were supposed to have heaviest BW. Comparable birth weight were observed in
the study which means that in this batch parity did not significantly affect the birth
weight, thus other factors should be consider. This was different with the results of
Knecht (2015). On the other hand, WWT was significant among parity levels, heaviest
WWT was observed in the mid parity sows.

Weaning to service interval (WSI). Late parity sows bred during this period had
the shortest WSI although comparable with mid parity sows; it was significantly different
from early parity sow that had the longest WSI

It is expected that early parity sows had the longest WSI since they utilize more
nutrients for growth, maintenance and nursing compared with multiparous sows. It was
also because of inadequate or low voluntary feed intake during lactation causing the
delay in estrus, thus having longer WSI. Tantasuparuk (2000) also found out that a
prolonged WSI was not because of sows nursing but also during rainy seaon when the

heat index was high.


The positive association between the numbers of pigs weaned per sow and the
decrease in back fat during lactation implies that higher back fat losses were observed in
sows that weaned more pigs. This is because large litter size requires more energy for

milk production (Ahere et al., 1999)


Summary and Conclusion

Evaporative cooling system (ECS) has been widely used in different commercial
swine farms to mitigate the effects of heat stress in sows, most especially during summer.
The farm used in the study had all ECS houses converted from the non-ECS houses
established in 1980°s. The study identifies the effects of housing improvement and
different parity levels on productivity performance of sows under a humid-tropical
climate. The sow performance records for February- November 2014 were analyzed.
Records were divided into three batches, based on the month the sows were bred:
February-March (batch 1; n=91), April-June (batch 2; n= 98) and July (batch 3; n=77).

In each batch, two groups of sows were selected, one held in conventional
housing while the other housed with evaporative cooling system (ECS). They were
further grouped based on their parity levels: early (1 to 2"), mid (3 to 5) and late (6"
and above). All the data were analysed using PROC GLM of SAS.

Temperature Humidity Index (THI) were computed to compare housing. THI
values were 73-79 and 76-83, 84-87 for batch 1, batch 2 and batch 3, respectively. The
THI during observation of batch I sows ranged from safe to critical condition while THI
for batch 2 and batch 3 were already in emergency situation. Thus it can be concluded
that sows during their gestation period experienced heat stress

Interaction effects of housing and parity on WSI for batch 1, TPB, LSBA and
BFTW for batch 2 implied that late parity sows (6 and beyond) benefited from ECS in

terms of WSI, TPB and LSBA. While early parity sows’ (1 - 2) BFTW were improved

nR

with ECS. It was also observed that ECS sows had consistently lower WSI, higher BFTW
and heaviest BW of piglets for all the batches of sows (see Appendix Figure 1).
Specifically, the current study observed that housing only affect WSI and BW for
first batch of data, BFTW for second batch of data. And no significant effect of housing
in any parameters from third batch was observed. Regarding the effect of parity, batch
Hate parity sows were found to have higher litter size born alive (LSBA) and total pigs
bom (TPB) while mid parity sows from the same batch had thicker back fat at farrowing
(BFTF), BFTW, heavier BW of piglets and shorter WSI (P<0.05). On the other hand,
batch 2 mid parity sows had higher LSBA, litter size at weaning (LSW), TPB and
heaviest BW and weaning weight (WWT) of piglets (P<0.05). Batch 2 early and late
parity sows had thicker BFTW. Lastly, batch 3 mid parity sows had the heaviest WWT

of piglets while late parity sows had the shortest WSI (P<0.05).

CHAPTER IV

ASSESSMENT OF HEAT STRESS BEHAVIORS AND HSP 70 OF
GILTS EXPOSED TO VARYING TEMPERATURE
IN CONTROLLED CHAMBER

Abstract

The study aimed to determine the effect of increasing temperature on
physiological performances and HSP 70 concentration of gilts (n=3; bw=986 kg). They
were individually housed in pen inside the controlled chamber with fixed RH (70%).
There were 4 THI set up (65 (19°C), 71(23°C), 77(27°C) and 83(31°C)) in the study
wherein each THI was constant for 3 consecutive days. Feeds and drinks were given ad
libitum. Monitoring of pulse rate, respiration rate (RR) and rectal temperature were done
every morning and afternoon before the blood collection. Blood was collected from the
ear vein and the collected samples were analyzed using HSP 70 ELISA. Highest RR
(p<0.005) and HSP 70 concentration (P<0.05) was observed when THI set up was 77 and
83, respectively. Meanwhile, feed intake decreased with increasing THI. Interaction
effect of day and time of HSP 70 concentrations were also observed. Results also showed
significant differences in duration and frequency of behaviors like meal intake, meal
break, standing, lying and drinking as affected by temperature and period of observation.
Therefore this study clearly reveals that HSP 70 at THI 71, RR at THI 77 as well as
cumulative morning or afternoon meal intake are the best indicator of heat stress.
Significantly lower than 2250+345 sec (37.5+5.8 min) cumulative duration of meal

intake is an indicator of heat stress in the morning or afternoon feeding.


Introduction

The understanding of the animal responses to thermal challenge is important to
successful implementation of strategies to ameliorate production level under warm
climate (Gourdine et al.,2012). Pigs are highly sensitive to even small climate changes
(high and low temperatures) mainly due to their minimal ability to sweat (Pedersen, et al.,
2003 cited by Debreceni, 2014). Thus, if they were not provided with ambient

temperature they will exhibit certain behaviors in response to heat stress.

This behavioral response can be explained by the hypothalamic control of
thermoregulatory process. The neurons in the hypothalamus were sensitive to
temperature of blood supply. The hypothalamus also receives a neural input from
thermoreceptor and has a set point that works like a thermostat. If the temperature of the
blood supply increases and is higher than the temperature set by the neural signals. The

body initiates cooling mechanisms like sweating, panting and other behavior regulations.

Lammers et al. (2007) enumerated some of the behaviors of the pigs when
exposed to high temperature like lying apart, maximizing contact with concrete, use of
dunging areas for lounging to cool themselves, creating of wallows, become more
irritable and aggressive, panting, decrease feed intake and increase water consumption.
Altered behavior connected with resting and lying were some of the behavioral patterns

as a response to high temperature that was cited by Olezak et al. (2015).


Meanwhile, in the cellular level, the gene networks within and across the cells
respond in the upper critical temperature with the help of heat stress responses. The heat
shock transcription factor was the first to respond in order to activate the heat stress
response (Bloemhof, 2008). Thus, this expression has been associated with the regulation
and the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSP) at the cellular level, which protects cell
from damage.

Classification of HSP is based on their molecular mass. This includes HSP 100,
HSP 90, HSP 70 and HSP 40 and the small HSP families. The HSP70 was one of the
most conserved families but found in almost all of the intracellular compartments
compared with other HSPs. It is release in response to different stress stimuli in living
organism (Turturici et al., 2011). Cho et al. (2014) observed an increase in the expression
of the equine HSP 70 mRNA extracted from blood after two hours of exercise compared
with baseline condition.

In terms of heat stress, Gu et al. (2012) conducted a study on the relationship of
HSP 70 to intestine under acute heat stress in broilers and after exposure to severe heat
they observed the elevation of HSP. Bahrndoff et al. (2009) found significant positive
association between thermotolerance and HSP 70 expression in Orchesella cincta.
Different HSP 70 levels of different thermal sensitivities of physiological system of
Tegula were also observed by Tomanek et al. (2003). Thus, identification of behavior,
physiological responses and extracellular HSP 70 levels for pigs would help the
researchers and persons in swine production to better identify what temperature will

greatly affect the pigs.


Materials And Methods

Time and location of the study

This study was performed at the quarantine area and Animal Physiology
Laboratory of the Animal and Dairy Sciences Cluster (ADSC), College of Agriculture
University of the Philippines Los Banos. Actual experiment was on May | to May 30,
2015, while observation of their behaviors thru the video records was done until July

2015.

Experimental Animals

Three gilts (n=3; bw=9826) were used in this study and were raised for 1 week at
ADSC quarantine area before transferring to the controlled chamber. The animals were
placed in a metabolism cage raised on a slatted flooring which is different than the farm
condition where most pigs are in direct contact with the pavement. All the procedures
conducted in the experiment were in compliance with the Republic Act No. 8485.

The animals were given ad libitum commercially available gestating feeds and drink
through the nipple drinker installed in their metabolism cage. Feed intake in terms of the
amount of feeds consumed was also recorded every day and it was noted that more than

5% of the feed offered in a day remained in the feeding trough.


Controlied Chamber set-up

There were 4 different step-up temperature regimes in the experiment with 4°C
interval (19, 23, 27 and 31°C). The actual observation was done for 12 days; 3 days for
each temperature regime, until the temperature reached 31°C. The relative humidity (RH)
was fixed to 70% (+10%). The Temperature Humidity Index (THI) was computed based
on the formula from NOAA, 1976 and was used by Botto et al. (2013): This was the
same formula used in component study 1

THI = 0.8T, + (RH/100) x (T,-14.3) + 46.4
Where:
Ta- ambient temperature (°C)
RH - relative humidity (%)
Using this formula we came up with four THI set up: 65 (19°C), 71 (23°C), 77 (23°C) and
83(31°C) for this experiment. Meanwhile, three monitoring video (IP Camera) was set-up
to capture the images of the different behaviours of the gilts in 24 hours. A functional

generator was made available during the duration of the study.

EXPERIMENT 1: Quantifying PRT and HSP 70 levels

A. PRT Data collection
Pulse rate, respiration rate and rectal temperatures were collected every 0800h and

1700h prior to blood collection. Respiration rate was monitored when they were resting


by counting the number of times their flank moved in and out in 60 seconds. Pulse rate
was measured with the use of stethoscope placed in the left node of the abdomen near the

forelegs by counting the heart beat (systole) per 60 seconds.

B. Blood collection and plasma HSP 70 assay

Blood from the ear veins were collected. The animals were restrained using a
snout rope and were stretched upwards. Vacuum tube with EDTA was used after the
needle was inserted in full length into the ear vein.

The blood in a test tube with EDTA was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1000 x g at
2-8°C within 30 minutes of collection. The aliquot plasma samples were stored at -40°C
until the time of assay. The study utilized the Cusabio enzyme ligand immunoassay
(ELISA). The ELISA procedure follows the company protocol Cusabio Manual (USA)

see Appendix Table |

Statistical analysis

The statistical design used was 4x2 Completely Randomized Design (CRD). The
1" and 2™ factors were temperature and time (am and pm) of collection, respectively
The THI set up were 65, 71, 77 and 83, while the time of collection was 0700H (am) and

1500H (pm).


EXPERIMENT 2: Observations of animal behaviors

Three (3) IP cameras were installed in the controlled chamber to record the
behavior of the gilts throughout the experiment. From the recorded videos, each hour of
observation was divided into 10 minutes intervals resulting in 240 observations per day.
The periods of the day were divided into 3 phases: 08:00-15:00h, 15:01-22:00h and
22:01-07:59h. Thus for each phase, there was 80 video clips to be observed. Each pig was
observed and all the data were tabulated. The duration and frequency of the following
behaviors were noted for 24 hours.

The observed behaviors’ duration and frequency are the following: meal intake
(MD), meal breaks (MB), drinking, lying and standing, urination and defecation. And here
are the guidelines for the observation

Lying on the floor: the pig lies on the floor of the pen (pigs sitting position, was

also consider as lying)

Standing: the pig stands, it can be eating and drinking?

Eating: (Meal intake) the pig is standing or sitting, it has its head down in the
feeder and it is eating

(meal break): whenever the pig pause for chewing with mouth above the feeder

Drinking: pigs suckle water from the nipple drinker


Statistical Analysis

The statistical design for experiment 2 was 4x3 Completely Randomized Design.
Increasing THI set-up and periods of observation were the factors for this study. Similar
with experiment 1 in this chapter, there were four THI set up (65, 71, 77 and 83). But the

video observation for gilts’ behavioral responses was divided into three periods.

For both experiments, the values obtained in the measurement procedures were
presented in Mean+SEM and comparison of means between and within different factors

was done using Least Significant Difference (LSD).

In practice, animal responses vary according to the duration and the intensity of
the thermal challenge. In temperate countries, short term changes in physiological,
behavioral and immunological functions are required to survive acute stressful events
(Gourdine et al., 2012). Listed in Table 11 are the respiration rate, pulse rate and rectal
temperature of the observed gilts in different temperature and time of collection.

Respiration rate (RR). The respiration rate increases as the temperature increases
although it can be observed that there is a decrease of RR from 40-35 bpm from THI 71
to 77, although not significant. At THI 83, the RR reach as significantly high rate as 81
bpm which was preceded by 3Sbpm when the THI was 77.

Pulse rate (PR). Similar to respiration rate, the pulse rate of the experimental
animals also increases as the temperature increases. However unlike RR, its increase is
not significant even if the highest PR (64) was observed in T3 and lowest in T1 (53.63),

indicative that the pulse rate is not a good indicator of heat stress in gilts.

Rectal temperature (RT). No significant effect of increase of temperature was
observed in rectal temperature of the animals although the highest RT was observed in T4
(39.57°C).

The time of collection did not significantly affect any of the physiological
responses observed in table aside from respiration rate wherein higher value of RR during
pm collection was observed compared with am collection (65 vs 53 bpm). Aside from
respiration rate, pulse rate and rectal temperature, the concentration of extracellular HSP

70 was also observed and the results were shown in Table 12.

(3.457) ng/l) but was not significant with T4 (3.436). Lowest concentration was observed
in T3 (3.419 ng/l). Interaction effect (P= 0.0171) of temperature and time of collection
‘on HSP 70 concentration was also observed in the study. Influence of the time of
collection was found at 19° and 31°C only, higher HSP70 levels were observed during
collection at 08:00H compared to 17:00H for 19°C, on the other hand, higher HSP70 was
observed during at 1700 hrs collection for THI 83.

The lowest HSP 70 concentration was observed in T4 during Am collection and
TI during Pm collection (3.40 ng/l) while highest was observed at T4 also during Pm

collection (47 ng/l)


DISCUSSION: EXPERIMENT 1

In study 1 the on-farm research reveals that the THI of the ECS and Non-ECS of
accredited breeder farm in Rizal from February to November is surprisingly increasing,
hence in study 2 since there is only one controlled chamber, these experiments were
designed to allow the animals be exposed to increasing temperature from 19 through 31.
Higher than 31°C was not pursued because the initial observation of gilts at 35°C showed

extreme panting response hence it was discontinued.

Effect of increasing THI in PRT. Animals are in phy

logical homeostasis
under normal conditions. But whenever there are external changes i.e. increase in
temperature there will be sudden changes internally and in the behavior of the animals to
maintain homeostatis Physiological responses like increase in respiration rate, body and
skin temperatures were among the effects of increasing temperatures (Rozeboom et al.,

2000; Pearce, 2014),

Respiration rate, The study observed different physiological responses of animals
as the temperature increases and the results were in Table 11. Positive relationship of RR
and increase in temperature was observed in the study. Highest bpm (81 bpm) was
observed in T4, which was the highest temperature.

According to Rozeboom et al. (2000) the normal RR of pigs are between 15 and
25 bpm and RR that is more than 40 bpm is an indication that the pigs are at risk of heat

stress while if it climbs up over 60 bpm the animals are probably suffering heat stress.


However, in the current study the lowest RR was 29 bpm during TI. RR of T2 and T3 of
the current study did not exceed 40 bpm which means that at until T3 (27°C/77 THI) the
experimental animals are still not at risk of heat stress. But it was in T4 when RR reached
81 bpm which means that at this temperature regime the pigs were already suffering heat
stress.

The increase in RR of pigs as the temperature increases is the result of them not
having functional sweat glands thus they rely mostly on panting for heat dissipation.
(Pearce, 2014) As the pigs pant faster their RR also increases, which also affects other
physiological parameters. Increase in RR is cooling mechanism used by sows.
(Williams, 2009).

Significant increase of RR (46bpm) in the study was observed between THI 77
and 83. This result was similar with the study of Renaudeau et al. (2004) who observed
that the temperature wherein the RR of animal increase markly, between 27 to 31°C. He
also stated that evaporative critical temperature (ECT) was between 30 and 32°C wherein
there is increase of 3.1 bpm and 19.3 bpm between 30 and 32°C and 32 and 34°C,
respectively. Results of the current study implied that RR as an indicator of heat stress
can be observed at THI 83 (31°C).

Sows, boars, and finishing pigs begin to feel the negative effects of heat stress at
about 20°C (68° F). The increase in respiration rate will increase the amount ofair going
in and out of the lungs. The increase in air flow increases evaporation of water from the
lungs. The pig is thus cooled via a process called evaporative cooling (Myer and Bucklin,

2001).


Huynh et al. (2005), observed an increase in RR of finishing pigs from 22°C to
34°C, with an average increase of 13 bpm per °C rise. As the temperature increases, there
is a rapid decrease in the sensible heat loss and the evaporative heat loss becomes the
only vital route for pigs to eliminate heat load, but pigs do not sweat and must pant, that

is why the pigs had increasing RR as the temperature increases

Pulse rate. The observed behavior is also similar to the experiment of Phuoc et
al., 2005. However, there are some points when PR apparently decline, although not
significant, in the experiment of Hubert (1954) wherein experiment was done in constant

environmental condition for 1 week, the pulse rate decline.

Rectal temperature. The normal body temperature of pig is 38.7 to 40°C and is
most comfortable in 18-20°C, but can adapt up to 25°C. However, no significant
differences between THI regimes in RT were observed in the study, this shows that the

gilts were not push to the severe stress condition.

Based on the results obtained by Renaudeau et al. (2004), RT remained constant
between 26 and 30°C at 38.3°C and had a significant increase between 30 and 34°C by
0.6°C. In their experiment the critical threshold temperature (Upper Critical Temperature)

is between 30 and 32°C wherein the RT started to rise.

Therefore, the result of the study implied that from THI 65 (19°C) — 83(31°C)
there will be comparable RT, and just like the other studies, RT was expected to increase

at temperature higher than 31°C.


Different result was obtained by Huynh et al. (2005), the RT on the other hand
started to increase when the temperature reaches 26.1°C by 0.13°C per °C . Although
Huynh observed significant differences of RT, he also stated that RT was the late

indicator of heat stress.

Significant differences in RT for sows was observed by Williams (2009), 38.33 vs
38.22°C, 39.47 vs 39.22 and 38.79 vs 38.74 °C for heat stress and thermoneutral during

gestation, lactation and breeding respectively.

Effect of time of collection in the PRT . Renaudeau et al. (2006) cited Morrison
and Mount (1971) and Giles (1992), who stated that the pig thermoregulatory response
has a biphasic profile consisting of an initial hyperthermia within the first 24-hour
exposure to heat stress and a subsequent recovery period characterized by a gradual
increase of body temperature. It declined over time of exposure in hot conditions (28°C
and 31°C and, 32° and 36°C). Thus, they observed that the decline in respiration rate and
in with the period of thermal acclimation tends to suggest that the demand for body

cooling is reduced.

Consistently the literatures above suggested that there is a possibility for the
physiological responses to decline over time of exposure to heat stress. Thus, we can
assume that between AM and PM observation in the study, lower physiological responses
should be observed in the PM observation. However, our current study found that there
was a significant increase during the PM collection, in terms of RR only. In this case, we

assumed that the gap of observation form AM and PM collection was not enough to


observe the thermal acclimation of the gilts. And during this period, there was still a high
demand for body cooling. Meanwhile, other physiological responses, which include RT
and PR, during AM and PM collection, were comparable.

Therefore, the results of current study implied that the time gap between 0800H
and 1700H observation was enough to detect significant differences for RR only. Larger
gap of time of observation within the day may be done to further assess any changes in

RT and PR.

Effect of temperature in HSP 70

Heat shock protein (HSP) 70 concentration. Results in Table 12 showed that an
increase in HSP 70 concentration was observed from THI 65- 71 and after that
comparable concentrations were noted. This result can be explained that the increase
from THI 65 to 71 triggers the release of more HSP 70 as a response to the effect of heat
‘stress due to sudden increase in stressful temperature. On the other hand, the comparable
concentrations from THI 77-83 might be an indication that the levels of HSP produced
were enough to protect the cells against any effect of heat stress.

Heat shock proteins (HSP) represent a highly conserved family of proteins whose
expression is induced in situations involving cell stress and other forms of injury. They
are normally localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The release of HSPs is trigger when
there is an environmental change that can cause disturbance in the physiological system
of an organism, which to an extent causes protein denaturation. (Oksala et al., 2014;

Tomanek, 2003)


They are closely related to thermal tolerance, which is the ability to survive at an
‘increasing temperature even at lethal temperatures. Oksala et al (2014) found that the
increase in HSP levels was parallel to the decrease in protein carbonyls and lipid
hydroperoxides, indicating that the decreased protein and lipid oxidation were
consequence of lower oxidative stress. Therefore, they suggest that acclimatization to
elevated temperature results in HSP-mediated adaptation and cytoprotection against
oxidative damage. Meanwhile, Lang et al. (2000) found out that cells overexpressing
HSP70 were protected against cytotoxicity induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), nitric
oxide (NO), oxidative stress, chemotherapeutic agents, ceramide, or radiation.

Several literatures stated above showed that levels of HSP 70 were affected by
different stress factors. The current study observed the effect of increase of temperature
and time of collection in the HSP 70 concentration. Significant interaction effect of THI
and time of collection was also found in the study on HSP70. This implied that the effect
of THI might be different at different time of collection.

Liu et al. (2000) stated that the synthesis of HSP70 from skeletal muscle peaks 8-
10 hours after stress and the concentration stays high for several days thus we can assume
that the afternoon collection might have higher concentration than morning collection.

Heat shock proteins can be increased due to heat, hypoxia, oxidative stress, and
nutritional stress. Their activity is prevalent within several hours of the onset of severe
stress and last for few days (Horowitz et al., 2000; Collier 2008) Timing of thermal

acclimation can range from days to weeks, whereas homeostatic mechanisms generally


take minutes to hours. Acclimation on a long-term scale has recently been proposed as a
homothetic mechanism (Collier et al., 2008)

Tomanek et al. (2003) found out that upregulated levels of HSPS returned to base
levels within days. In his study, the HSP levels of unmanipulated snails collected from
their natural zones had minimal change with the varying temperature, which further
indicates that they did not experience thermal stress.

The repeated sudden increase in core temperature will still enable the
microorganisms to carry out work because of heat dissipation as an adaptive process. In
this case, acclimatization occurs when the mild heat shock treatment conditions cause the

survival of the cells despite the increase in temperature (Moseley, 1997)

The regulation of HSP expression occurs at the transcriptional level. The
transcription factors known as heat shock factors (HSfs) bind with the heat shock
elements (HSEs) located in the promoter region of hsp gene. During unstressed condition,
HSP 70 binds with the HSFI to form the folded inactive monomeric state. However,
during stressed condition, cellular proteins were denaturated causing the depletion of free
HSP 70. Thus, HSF1 is release, which caused the unfolding of the HSF1 that triggers

trimerization, and translocation to the nucleus (Pirkkala et al., 2001; Morimoto, 1998)


RESULTS: EXPERIMENT 2

The duration and frequency of the behavioral responses of gilts were also
observed 24 hours with the help of the IP cam installed in the controlled chamber. The
observed behaviors were partitioned in three periods, ie. first 0800 ~ 1500; second 1501
to 2300 and third 2301 to 0759 hrs. The behaviors taken were components of voluntary
feed intake, such as (1) meal intake (MI) and (2) meal break (MB), (3) standing, (4)
lying, (5) drinking, (6) urination (URI) and (7) defecation (DEF). The amount of 24
hours feed intake during the first day of exposure to temperature regime was also

measured and recorded.

Table 13 showed the effect of increasing temperature in the feed intake, duration

and frequency of meal intake and meal break.


Feed intake (FI). Decline in feed intake as the temperature increases was
observed in the experiment. The feed intake started to decrease at 23°C. The highest
feed intake was observed during Tl (19°C/65 THI; 6000g) and lowest during T4
(31°C/83 THI; 3403g). No significant difference was observed in FI during T2 (23°C/ 71

THI; 4533g) and T3 (27°C/77 THI; 43769).

Meal intake (MI). Longest duration (4708s) for MI was observed when the
temperature was 23°C (T2/71 THI) although not significant with Tl (4701s) while T4
(31°C/ 83 THI) had the shortest MI duration (690s). It can be observed that MI duration
decreases as the temperature increases. Having the longest MI duration, T2 also had the
most frequent MI (11.11). Least frequent MI was observed during T3 (5.78) but was not
significant with T4 (7.78)

Meal break (MB). Longest meal break duration (722.33s) was observed during
T4 while shortest was during TI. It can be observed that the duration of meal breaks
increases as the temperature increases. On the other hand, no significant differences were
observed in the MB of various temperature regime, even if the most frequent MB was

observed during T1 (34.22) and least frequent during T3 (22.4).

The effect of the increasing temperature on the duration and frequency of standing

and lying was shown in Table 14.

Stand. Based on Table 14, it can be observed that the duration of standing was
significant as the temperature increases (P = 0.07). Hence, longest standing duration was
observed during T1 (6696s) while the shortest duration was observed in T4 (3490).
Comparable values were also observed in the frequency of standing. It was found out that
they shift from standing to lying less during T3 (11.33). However, frequencies of

standing during TI (16.56), T2 (17.00) and T3 (16.00) were comparable.

Lying. Longest lying duration was observed during T4 (25495s) and shortest was
during T1 (2304s). The same with standing duration, it increases as the temperature
increases although not significantly different, However, unlike standing frequency, its
frequency had a positive relationship with the increase of temperature. It can be observed
that sows were lying less frequent during T1 (42.11) and they tend to lay more during T4

(48.89).

The effect of increasing temperature in the duration and frequency of drinking,
urination ad defecation was also considered in this study and the results were shown in

Table 15.

Drink. Longest drinking duration was observed during T4 (184.11s) while the
shortest was during T3 (52.22s), wherein there was a sudden drop of drinking duration
from T2 (118.11). It was also during T3 when the animals had least frequency of drinking
(4.56). Highest frequency of drinking was observed during T4 (10.11). Over-all effect of

THI on drinking shows not statistically significant.

Urination (URI). Based on Table 15, it can be observed that the duration for
urination increases as the temperature increases although not significant (P ~0.87). The
longest urination was observed during T4 (37.56s) while shortest duration during TI
(24.228). Positive relationship of temperature and urination frequency was also observed
in the study although not significantly different. Animals during T4 urinate in the average

of 2.67 per day, while least urination was observed during T3 (1.56).


Defecation (DEF). On the other hand, negative relationship between defecation
and temperature was observed. Duration of defecation decreases as the temperature
increases, hence, longest duration was observed TI (19.78s) and the shortest was during
T4 (8.885). Decline in the frequency of defecation was also observed although not
significant. It was found out that, in the average, the animals defecate 2 times per day

during TI and T2 and 1.44 times per day during T3 and T4.

The period of observation was also considered in this study; hence, the day of
observation was divided into three phases or periods. Similar with the effect of
temperature, the duration and frequency of the behavior were also noted in different
phases of observation.

Based on Table 17, it was also during P2 wherein the animals had the longest standing
duration (7036s) and shortest was observed during P3 (1830s). However, it was during
the 3" period where they had the longest duration of lying (34195s) and highest
frequency (60.92).

Results in Table 18 showed that longest drinking duration was observed during P2
(160.83s) but was not significant with the other time periods. Drinking frequencies, on
the other hand, were significantly different. It was also during P2 (11.0) where they drink
most frequent. Least frequency of drinking was observed during P3 (3.17)

No significant effect of time period was observed in urination, defecation.
However, it was during the P3 (31.33s) and P2 (20.08) where they have the longest
duration for urination and defecation, respectively. Their urination frequency was
comparable even if during P1, they urinate at 1.17 times per day compared with P2 and
P3 wherein they urinate at 2.33 times per day. Significant defecation frequency was
observed. It was found out that highest defecation frequency was observed during P2

(2.42), and lowest during P3 (1.17).

duration at first period was observed at Tl (2642.67s) while shortest duration during the


same period was observed at T4 (763.00). On the other hand, longest meal duration for

DISCUSSION: Experiment 2

Effect of different THI set-up in the thermoregulatory behaviors

Pigs have reduced ability for heat transfer since they have small amount of
sweat gland, subcutaneous fat layer and a barrel shaped body. However, they developed a
wide range of behavioral thermoregulation systems and as a response to high temperature
different behavioral patterns can be observed which included the increase in water intake.
(Olczak, 2015) The study of Debreceni (2014) confirmed that high temperature
influences the behavior of animals. Pigs suppress eating and increase water intake during
periods of heat stress. Also, lying patterns become very spread as pigs attempt to increase

their surface area to the surroundings. (Hoff,nd)

Feed intake . As expected decline in feed intake as the temperature increases was
observed in the experiment. The feed intake started to decrease at 23°C. The highest
feed intake was observed during T1 (19°C/65 THI; 6000g) and lowest during T4 (31°C/
83THI, 3403g). No significant difference was observed in FI during T2 (23°C/71 THI;

4533g) and T3 (27°C/77 THI; 43762).

Meal intake and meal break. Duration and frequency of different
thermoregulatory behaviors were observed in the study. Based on Table 13 as the
temperature increases, the duration of MI decreases but the duration of MB increases. On

the other hand, the frequency of MI and MB decreases as the temperature increases. The


indicator of gilts experiencing stress on the basis of meal intake is below 2250s (37.5
min)

Quinou et al. (2000) also observed a decrease in meal duration as the temperature
increases (64 min vs 46 min/d at 19 and 29°C). Collin et al. (2001) reported a 33%
decrease in meal consumption time due to the increase in temperature (3.9 min vs 5.9
min). Meanwhile, Hyun et al. (2005) found out that higher percentages of pigs were
standing (17.5% vs. 13.6%) eating (11.5 % vs. 9.4%) and sitting (4.8% vs. 4%) at

thermoneutral temperature than those in high temperature environment.

Standing and lying. Based on Table 14, it can be observed that the duration of
standing decreases as the temperature increases, while lying increases as the temperature
increases, although not significant, which is similar with the study of Debreceni (2014),

Pigs spend the most amount of time on resting (Olezak, 2015). However, as the
temperature increases, lying patterns also increases. The increase in temperature caused
the pigs to become inactive and uncomfortable. Thus, in order to maximize heat loss they
stretched-out and extend bodily contact with the floor (Debreceni, 2014). The results of
the experiment showed that the pigs influenced by high temperature were more lying than
standing.

Huynh (2005), stated that for each degree Celsius increase in the temperature
there was a 0.2% increase in the lying percentage. He found out that pigs at high
temperature (28-34°C) had higher proportions of lying activity (72.7%, P<0.05)

compared with thermoneutral temperature (65.8%). In that study they conclude that


temperature has a strong effect on the lying, which is similar to the result of the present
study wherein we observed that the duration and frequency of lying increases

significantly as the temperature increases.

Drinking, Urination and Defecation . Drinking is related to eating (Debreceni,
2014). Pigs suppress eating and increase water intake during periods of heat stress. (Hoff

et al., nd) On average, pigs eat 10 to 25 meals per day, with younger pigs having more
meals than older pigs. The current study observed that drinking duration also increases as
the temperature increases.

The drinking frequency of pigs is parallel with the eating frequency. They usually
drink 10 minutes after eating. Specifically, the grower-finisher pigs drink around 20 to 30
minutes per day. However, when exposed to heat stress they spend more time drinking
and playing with the drinker (Yuzhi Li, (nd)

The current study found out no significant effect of increasing temperature in the
duration and frequency of urination and defecation. In contrast, Huynh (2005) stated that
temperature has strong effect on the excreting behavior of pigs.. He observed that the pigs
urinated 3.5 times and defecated 2.3 times on the average per day. Inverse relationship of
the average frequency of urination and defecation for each degree Celsius increase in
temperature was also found in his study.

The current study on the other hand, observed an increase in the urination
duration and frequency as the temperature increases although not significant. The

increase in urination may have been caused by the increase in drinking. Similar to the


study of Huynh (2005), we also observed a decrease in the defecation’s duration and

frequency although not significant.

Effect of different time periods in the thermoregulatory behaviors. Listed in
Tables 16 to 18 are the behaviors of the pigs in relation with the effect of different
periods throughout the days of observation. The importance of this section is to
understand the basic pattern of behavior of gilts/pigs confined individually in

metabolism cage fed twice a day, i.e. 07:00 and 15:00h.

Meal intake and meal break. Debreceni (2014) stated that eating events peak in
the morning and evening. Even though pigs will eat during the night, the number and
duration of meals is less than during the day. Hétzel et al. (2009) found out that in the
initial period, the frequencies of eating was higher than the other periods in his study.

The study found out significant effect of time periods in duration and frequency
of MI, MB as shown in Table 16. The decrease of all the behaviors’ duration and
frequency was observed as the time period approached nighttime. The animals are
expected to eat less on the P3, because they are more expected to sleep, given that there is
no light during this time. Comparable results for P! and P2 for all behaviors were
observed in the study, which implied that these periods (08:00-15:00h and 15:01-22:59h)
can be used to assess animal condition in terms of meal intake. Results of the study were

similar with Fraser (1984) who reported that in the group of pigs, the peak of feeding is in


the morning, one or two other peaks are later in day and modest intake is during the hours
of darkness.

Interaction effect of temperature and period on meal intake. Significant
interaction effects of temperature and period were found at first and second period of
observation of meal intake duration. Results of the study implied that average cumulative
meal intake duration shorter than 2250.66s (37 min) during 08:00 to 15:00h and 15:01 to
21:59h at 23°C/THIT1 can be an indicator of heat stress. The continuous meal about in

the morning registered until 1000 h while in the afternoon it is until 2000 h.

Debreceni (2014) also found interaction between the observed hours and eating,
where the time spent by eating differed during the experimental hours. Simonsen (1990),
that pigs were active with peaks in the morning and afternoon. Ingram et al. (1980)
showed that if temperature is constant (25°C), pigs exposed to 12 h light and 12 h dark
are generally much more active during the light phase, and show a gradual increase in

feeding and other activities during the daylight hour.

Standing and Lying. Significant effect of periods in lying and standing was
observed in the study. Longest lying duration was observed during P3, (18067s to
34195s) which is actually the sleeping time of pigs and comparable standing duration

during P1 and P2 which was the period that they usually eat.

Debreceni (2014) observed that pigs were mostly lying at early in the morning

compared with other activities like standing and eating. And then lying decreases during


the time when they usually eat more (09:00h and 10:00h). Meanwhile, Fraser et al. (1991

showed that the pigs were more active in the afternoon than in the morning.

Drinking, Urination and Defecation. The frequency of drinking was significantly
different at periods of observation. The gilts were found to drink often during P2, which
was also the same period when they eat more often. Debreceni (2014) stated that the
drinking has positive relationship with eating. Aside from the frequency of drinking, no
other significant effect of periods were observed in the study. The result implied that at
any time of the day the gilts had comparable duration and frequency of urination and
defecation. Thus, urination and defecation of gilts were not advisable to be the first

indicator of heat stress.


Summary and conclusion

Several articles documented the study on physiological and behavioral responses
of pigs in increasing temperature. Thus, the study aimed to determine the effect of
increasing temperature on physiological performances and HSP 70 of gilts. Three gilts
were individually housed in pen inside the controlled chamber with fixed RH (70%).
There were 4 temperature set up in the study wherein each temperature was constant for 3
consecutive days. After that temperature was increased by 4°C from 19 to 31°C. The THI
was also computed based on the different temperature regimes and fixed RH of 70%.
Observation of Pulse rate, respiration rate and rectal temperature was done every 07:00h
and 15:00h prior to blood collection. Observation of behavior was done with the help of
the IP camera installed.

The study found significant differences in RR and HSP 70 in different levels of
THI. Highest RR and HSP 70 were observed in THI 83 and 71 respectively. HSP 70
concentration increases from Tl to T2 but remain comparable in the succeeding
temperatures. Results implied that temperature higher than 27°C might cause significant
increase in the respiration rate of gilts. Meanwhile temperature increase from 19 to 23°C
which was equivalent to THI 65 to 71 in the study, might also cause heat stress in gilts,
which triggers the release of higher HSP 70 to sustain the needs of the body to combat
the effects of high temperature. Interaction effect of temperature and time of blood
collection was also observed in HSP 70 concentration. Effect of temperature might be

different at level of time of collection.

aay

Significant decline in feed intake, duration and frequency of meal intake and meal
break was observed as the THI increases. Significant differences in meal intake and meal
break were also observed in different periods of observation. Significant interaction
effects of temperature and period were found at first and second period of observation of
meal intake duration. Duration and frequency of standing and lying in different
temperature regime and periods of observation were also significant.

Results of the study implied that significant changes in the respiration rate, feed
intake meal intake, meal break, standing and lying could be an indicator of heat stress.
‘Any significant changes in the observed behaviors from temperature higher than 23°C
could mean that the sows might be experiencing heat stress. Urination and defecation on

the other hand could be late indicator of heat stress like rectal temperature and pulse rate


Over-all Summary and Conclusion
(Study 1 and 2)

The study attempted to analyze the reproductive performance of sows and gilts in
different housing system (ECS vs non-ECS) and also to understand physiological
responses of sexually matured gilts expose at gradual increase temperature in a controlled
chamber equipped with IP cameras to identify and qualify indicators of behavioral stress.
Thus, the study was divided into two studies.

The first study focused on the effect of heat stress on sows reproductive
performances in house with and without ECS (n=266) from February to November 2014.
The THI was also evaluated during the period of observation. The range of THI for batch
1 was classified as safe to dangerous while batch 2 and batch 3 THI fall on the
emergency situation implying that the observed animals are experiencing heat stress. The
sows were further divided into different batches based on the month that they were bred.
Significant effect of housing was observed in BW and WSI for batch 1, BFTW for batch
2. No significant effect of housing was observed in batch 3.

Meanwhile parity had significant effects on WSI, LSBA, TPB, BFTF, BFTW and
BW for batch 1. Almost same parameters were also affected by parity in the second batch
of sows observed, however in this batch, parity did not affect, instead it affects the WWT
of piglets. Lastly, in the third batch, WWT and WSI were the parameters that had
significant differences.

Interaction effects of parity and housing implied that, ECS improved TPB, LSBA

and WSI for late parity sows, while BFTW for early parity sows.


The second study focused on the physiological and behavioral responses of
animals and also the concentration of HSP 70 in different temperatures in controlled
chamber. This study was further divided into two experiments. Thefirst was the
measurement of PRT and HSP 70 as affected by increasing temperature and time of
collection. The second was the monitoring of duration and frequency of animals behavior

in different THI set up and period of observation.

The study found significant differences in RR and HSP 70 in different THI set-up
and time of collection. Interaction effect of temperature and time of blood collection was
also observed in the levels of HSP 70. This implied that the effect of temperature might
be different at different time of collection.

Significant decline in feed intake was also observed as the duration and frequency
of meal intake and meal break decreases as the temperature increases and at different
periods of observation. Significant interaction effects of temperature and period were

found at first and second period of observation of meal intake duration.

Results implied that significant changes in the respiration rate meal intake, meal
break, can be an indicator of heat stress. Standing, Lying Urination and defecation on the
other hand could be late indicator of heat stress like rectal temperature and pulse rate.

Any significant changes in the observed behaviors from temperature higher than

THI of 71 (23°C and 70%RH) could mean that the sows were experiencing heat stress.


Recommendations

In the study 1, housing and parity were the only factors examined, and results
showed different parameters that had significant differences because of these factors.
However, it is also of importance to consider other factors like season, nutrition, breed
and management system for future studies. Aside from that, it was also recommended to
conduct researches on the difference between the performances of sows when they were
housed in ECS house during the breeding period. In terms of study 2, it is recommended
to conduct another study on the effect of increasing temperature with varying humidity
could also be considered in studying behavioral and physiological responses. It is also
recommended to conduct study on the comparison of HSP 70, behavior and physiological

responses of native and commercial pigs to varying THI.
