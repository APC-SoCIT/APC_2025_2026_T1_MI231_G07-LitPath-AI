Abstract

In the framework of space-fractional quantum mechanics, systems with mul-
tiple Dirac-δ and locally periodic potentials are studied. First, bound states for
multiple Dirac-δ wells with uniform strength are considered and analyzed using the
momentum-space (Fourier transform) approach. A matrix formulation that facilitates
the analysis of bound states for this system is presented. This matrix formulation
is applied to derive expressions satisfied by the bound-state energies of N = 1,2,3
6-function wells. Known results for single and double delta wells are recovered. The
case of a triple Dirac-δ well extends the application of the proposed matrix method.
It is shown that obtaining bound states for higher numbers of Dirac-δ wells is concep-
tually straightforward from the matrix eigenvalue equation derived. The bound-state
wave functions are expressed in terms of Fox’s H-function. Second, transmission through locally periodic potentials is analyzed using the
piecewise approach. In particular, transmission probabilities T(N) for a particle in
a chain of N Dirac-δ barriers and for a particle in a chain of N square barriers
are calculated. A transfer-matrix approach in the context of fractional quantum
mechanics is adapted together with the jump condition for the fractional derivative
of a wave function. For N > 1 plots of T(N) for both barrier systems exhibit
hill-like (or plateau-like) and valley-like structures for a certain range of energies
FE. The numbers of these structures increase as the fractal order (Lévy index) α
decreases. Also observed in the case of Dirac-δ multibarrier system is the presence of
undulations in each hill-like structure, which is related to the number of barriers by
N — 1, independent on the value of α. Emergence of bandlike structures for as low
as N = 4 barriers, which is known to be a characteristic of periodic potentials, is also
seen. These bandlike structures are more apparent as the number of undulations in
each hill increases and are more apparent for lower values of α. Third, special cases of Dirac-δ potentials with non-uniform strengths are consid-
ered. Specifically, the space-fractional Schrédinger equation with a dipolar double
Dirac-δ potential and the one with a quadrupolar triple Dirac-δ potential are solved.
The momentum-space approach is used in the analysis, which is divided into two
cases: E < 0 for bound state and E ≥ 0 for scattering state. The wave functions for both potentials are expressed in terms of Fox’s H-function. Graphical analysis
reveals only one unique bound-state eigenenergy α for each potential, which shifts
to higher values as α decreases. The corresponding wave functions are found to be
antisymmetric for the dipolar potential and, with the particular choice W = Z for
these parameters, symmetric for the quadrupolar potential. The scattering-state wave
functions for the two systems are also obtained as precursors to analyzing scattering
properties of these potentials.

Introduction

1.1 Background of the study

Application of fractional calculus to other branches of science such as biology,
chemistry, and physics has been a topic of major interest for many years. Historically,
fractional calculus, which is the natural generalization of integrals and derivatives to
non-integral orders, is a subject that can be traced back to a communication between
Leibniz and L’Hospital in 1695 where the latter asked what would d"y/dz” mean if
n = 1/2, that is, fractional [1, 2, 3]. This caught the attention of many famous mathe-
maticiaus aside from Leibniz who of course provided the first response to L’Tléspital’s
inquiry. To name a few, these include Euler in 1730 who defined fractional deriva-
tives in terms of the gamma function, Laplace in 1812 who expressed its definition
in an integral form, Fourier in 1822 who made the initial step to generalize fractional
differentiation of an arbitrary function, and Abel in 1823 who considered an alternate
intcgral definition |2|. But it seems that the most well-known definitions arc thosc of
Riemann-Liouville for both fractional derivatives and integrals (differintegrals) (4, 5],
Caputo for fractional differentiation (5, 6, 7, 8], and Liouville for fractional integration

One of the advantages of fractional calculus is that in complex systems it en-
ables one to obtain dynamical models of processes that have nonlocal dynamics and
are described by long-term memory in time [4]. It has also found applications in
studying natural phenomena demonstrating properties such as heredity, nonlocality,
self-similarity, and stochasticity [9]. In physics, it is applied to describe the behavior
of trajectories in chaotic Hamiltonian systems, to investigate surface-interacting poly-
mers and decimation transformation of random-walk models, and to study relaxation
and diffusion models in biophysical phenomena [3]. There is also an effort to find

connections among fractional calculus, linear viscoelasticity, and wave motion [10].

Tn the field of quantum physics, the concept of fractality and application of frac-
tional calculus have not been realized until recently when Laskin [11, 12, 13, 14]
made the effort, of introducing the topic to quantum mechanics for the first. time and
thus gave birth to a new field thal is popularly known today as “fractional quan-
tum mechanics (FQM).” He established this by constructing a path integral over the
paths of Lévy flights which, consequently, provided a fractional geucralization of the
Schrédinger equation with spatial derivative of order a (1 < a < 2). When a = 2 the
standard quantum mechanics (SQM) can be recovered as a special case. After Laskin
several authors have applied FQM to study various quantum systems (see Chapter
2), and over the past decades it has been a diverse area of research that one can even
furnish a compilation of published papers in a monograph [15].

As an extension to known applications of FQM in the literature, in this study,
it is applied to study other quantum systems in one dimension such as multiple
Dirac-6 wells with uniform strength, locally periodic potentials such as Dirac-d and
square barriers, and special types of Dirac-d potentials with non-uniform strengths.
The first system serves as a toy model for a particle, i.e., electron, interacting with
identical nuclei. Bound states for this system are aimed to be determined. For the
second system, wave transmission is investigated. This problem is paramount to
understanding the allowed and forbidden states of a particle in a crystal lattice. In
SQM the literature for this problem is rich with derivatives such as scattering from
periodic one-dimensional finite lattices [16, 17] and quasiperiodic and random lattices
{18], and tunneling through barriers arranged in a Fibonacci sequence (Fibonacci
barriers) [19]. The third system consists of dipolar double and quadrupolar triple
Dirac-¢ potentials, which are studied separately. The dipolar case serves as a model for
a particle interacting with a dipole, while the quadrupolar one describes an electron’s
interaction with a linear symmetric triatomic molecule [20].

1.2 Objectives

This study aims to extend applications of space-fractional quantum mechanics
to other quantum systems. Specifically, the solutions to the one-dimensional Lime-
independent space-fractional Schrédinger equations with multiple Dirac-6 and locally
periodic potentials are sought to determine the bound states and study some scatter-
ing properties such as wave transmission. It also aims to apply two of the well-known
methods in fractional quantum mechanics, the piecewise and momentum-space ap-
proaches, and to explore other possible auxiliary techniques that will facilitate calcu-
lations and analysis.

1.3. Organization

This thesis is organized as follows:

Chapter 2 presents a review of formalism of fractional quantum mechanics (FQM).
Section 1 discusses its formulation and first physical applications and introduces the
space-fractional Schrodinger equation (SFSE) in space and momentum representa-
tions. Section 2 cites some recent development in FQM such as the variants of SFSE
which include the time-fractional and space-time fractional Schrédinger equations as
well as the recent controversy in space-fractional quantum mechanics (SFQM).

Chapter 3 discusses the first of the three applications of SFQM considered in
the present study: the bound states for multiple Dirac-6 wells. Section 1 introduces
the attractive Dirac comb. The next section illustrates the method of reducing the
eigenenergy problem to a matrix eigenvalue equation. Section 3 presents applications
of this formulation to obtaining bound states of N = 1, 2,3 d-function wells. Section 4
presents verification of the bound-state solutions obtained in Sec. 3. The last section
serves as a chapter summary.

Chapter 4 discusses transmission through locally periodic potentials. This includes
discussion of the discontinuity condition for the space-fractional derivative of the
wave function (Sec. 1), the transfer-matrix method adapted (Sec. 2), applications to
calculating transmission coefficients for a particle in an array of N Dirac-o barriers
(Sec. 3) and square barriers (Sec. 4), and reduction of the results to those of standard
quantum mechanics (Sec. 5). Section 6 presents a chapter summary.

Chapter 5 presents applications of SFQM to systems of Dirac-d potentials with
non-uniform strengths. Section 1 considers a dipolar double Dirac-é potential which
bound state and scattering-state wave function are obtained separately. Section 2 fol-
lows the presentation in Sec. 1 for a quadrupolar triple Dirac-6 potential. Verification
of scallering-stale solutions and ils asymptotic behavior near infinity are discussed
in Sec. 3. A summary is given in Sec. 4.

Finally, the conclusions and some recommendations are given in Chapter 6. This
is followed by Appendix A which introduces Fox’s H-function and Appendix B which
demonstrates the application of Fox’s H-function to evaluating the integrals that
appear in the solutions. Appendix C details the derivation of the integral of the
time-independent space-fractional Schrodinger equation.

Chapter 2

Fractional quantum mechanics

An overview of formalism of fractional quantum mechanics (FQM) and a review of
some recent development in this field are presented in this chapter. Bulk of the first
section is taken from pioneering papers of Laskin [11, 12, 13, 14].

2.1 Formulation and first physical applications

In Refs. [11, 12, 13] Laskin introduced the concept of fractality to quantum
mechanics and came up with a fractional path integral approach that generalizes
Feynman path integrals in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics by con-
sidering measures induced by the Lévy-flight stochastic process, insLead of Brownian
motion. Such formalism is briefly outlined here for future reference.

The path-integral approach to quantum mechanics considers a particle that starts
from some point z, at an initial time ¢, and goes to an end point x, at time t,. Then
its trajectory z(t) can be described as x(ta) = Za and z(t,) = 2, and a quantum
kernel Kr(ate|zoty) for this particle going from point a to point b in the potential
V(z) can be introduced as follows:

K p(tale|rols) = [ Dreynman‘(T) exp { = ; [ V(r(r)yar} ; (2.1)

where the potential energy V(z(7)) is given as a functional of the particle path x(r).

The Feynman functional measure is

“ °° ; N/2
/ Dreynmanzt(T){...} = lim / dr,---dty- (==)

N- co m

where m is the particle’s mass, (r9,tn) = (Za,2p), and € = (ty) — ta)/N. The above
equation conveys the typical scaling relation between the displacement in space and
the time scale of a Brownian path [12]:

(a5 — aj-1) oc (A/a)? (An)¥?, (2.3)

which implies that the fractal dimension of the Feynman path is df" = 2. This
path-integral definition leads to the standard non-fractional quantum mechanics.

To generalize the above path-integral approach, Laskin introduced another frac-
tional path integral of the form [11, 12, 13]

K1(tate|tets) = | : Drasin2 (7) exp {5 [ : v(e(s)jar}, (2.4)

where in this case the potential energy V(x(7)) is now a functional of the path of a
Lévy particle (in contrast to a Brownian one) and the fractional path-integral measure
now becomes

Ly foe} iD -N/a
| Drastint(7){...} = lim / dey ---dty_h ™ ¢ =)

N-0o

ay Ia

Here, D, is termed as the “generalized quantum diffusion coefficient,” which has the
physical dimension [D,] = erg’~*cm®s~%, and L, is the Lévy distribution function
expressed in terms of Fox’s H-function [21] as [11, 12, 13]

(1,1),(1,1/2)

Dat\ 7/2 1/h \'/* 1 1/h \'/*
1 a = oan = —H)! = oan
n (=) taf 3 (a) a alz| 7? Go) a
(2.6)

where a is the Lévy index. In analogy with the Brownian case the scaling relation in
the Lévy case is [12]

ncn |

|; — @;-1| oc (R271 D,)/2(At)!/2. (2.7)


from which the fractal dimension of the Lévy path can be deduced as ayy =a. Ow-
ing to the existence condition of the first moment, c.g., physical averages of particle’s
momentum and space coordinates, the value of a is restricted to 1 < a < 2 (for a
detailed discussion, refer to Sec. II of Ref. [12] and Secs. II, V, and VI of Ref. [13]).
The preceding fractional path-integral formulation lays the foundation of fractional
quantum mechanics, which includes as a special case the Feynman path-integral re-
sults when « = 2.

The first application of fractional path integral is the calculation of the free-particle
propagator K?(zryty|rata). Laskin obtained (11, 12, 13]

KP (aots|Zata) =| Dysskint(T) -1 =h7} (Pes oll 2)

1 h l/a
Tad = a - Tal >.
oman (om = 35) Ine ~ Tal

(2.8)

When a = 2, using the property of Fox’s H-function [see Eq. (A.4) in Appendix Al],
it can be shown that this reduces to the Feynman free-particle propagator:

Expressing these two kernels in terms of their respective momentum representations,
he was able to determine the free-particle energy /“,, with momentum p, that is [11, 12],

Fp = Dall", (2.10)

which is the non-relativistic fractional quantum-mechanical particle dispersion rela-
tion [13]. From this equation it can be deduced that when a = 2 the generalized
quantum diffusion coefficient should be D. = 1/2m such that the standard non-
relativistic result, My = p?/2m, is recovered.

2.1.1 Space-fractional Schrédinger equation and the quan-

tum Riesz fractional derivative

Enable to derive the fractional Schrédinger equation Laskin described the evo-
lution of a fractional quantum-mechanical system using propagator (2.4) as follows
(11, 12, 13]:

W;(20, ly) = | dra Kr (2vlo|xale) Vi(xe, la), (2.11)


with W,(, te) being the initial-state fractional wave function and W (zp, t,) being the
final-state onc. Sctting 4, > (+c, ic., treating the final time as varying infinitesimally
by an interval « from the starting time t, — t, and applying Feynman’s approximation
fr" V(a(r)) = V(a + y/2) and Eq. (2.4),

W(x, t+e) -f avs | dpexp fae t) _ i Pasel 5 (=F) \ Wy, t).
(2.12)

Expanding this in a power scrics (up to first order in ¢) and using the definition of
Fourier transform,

W(p,t) = / e P/N (x, t)dx, (2.13)
Went) = 5 fem, tap, (2.14)
2th J_ oo
the following expression can be derived [12, 13]:
aW(; D
W(x.) + AE) = W(a,l) +i 5 (AV) Wa. l) - FV (a) W(x, 1), (2.15)
where ; xo

(AV)Wa,t) =~ fe Mplb(p. dp (2.16)

is the quantum Riesz fractional derivative. Then it can be deduced that, for Eq.
(2.15) to be true to order «, the fractional wave function W(«:,/) must satisfy the
following fractional differential equation [11, 12, 13, 14]:

av(z, t)

ih Ey

= —D,(hV)"V(z, t) + V(x) W(z, t), (2.17)

which is the one-dimensional space-fractional Schrédinger equation (SFSE).

An equivalent form of the SFSE derived by Laskin above that is used more often
in the FQM literature and shall be adapted in the present study is the one with the
transformation —(hV)* > (—h?A)*/?, where A = 0?/0z? is the 1D Laplacian, that
is (22, 23, 24, 25},

OV (zx, t)
ih aE

so that the quantum Riesz fractional operator can be defined as

= D,,(-hA)?/h(z, t) + V(x) V(z, t), (2.18)

1 ~° ~
(WV) 0(a, 0) = of e™mnieb(0, tha (2.19)


In Ref. [14] some properties of the SFSE (2.18) in three dimensions were studied. In
operator form, this may be written as

au
ihc = ; 2.2
ih>- = How. (2.20)
where
H, = D,(—-h’A)*”? + V(r, t) (2.21)

is the fractional Hamiltonian operator. An important result is that, using an in-
tegration by parts formula based on the definition of the quantum Riesz fractional
derivative, (9, (—h?A)*/?x) = ((—h?A)?/?¢, y), it was shown that this operator is
Hermitian in space, i.e., (H+, x) = (¢, Hax), under the scalar product

(ox = [ ” or (e.t)x(e tar. (2.22)

Consequently, the energy of the fractional quantum system is real (see Sec. III of
Ref. [14]). Parity conservation law for FQM was also established in the sense that the
fractional Hamiltonian (2.21) remains invariant under spatial inversion transformation
r — —r. This can readily be seen by discerning that the operator (—A?A)?/? is in
fact a symmetrized fractional derivative: (—h?A,)°/?{...} = (—R?A_,)7/7{... }.

Another important result cited in Ref. [14] which has a direct application here in
the analysis of wave transmission through locally periodic potentials (Chapter 4) is
the current density for FQM. If Eq. (2.20) is multiplied from the left by the complex
conjugate U(r, t) and subtracted from the equation resulting from the complex con-
jugate of Eq. (2.20) multiplied from the left by V(r, t), an integral equation can be
obtained which leads to the differential equation of the form [{14]

elt, t) +V-j(r,t) =0, (2.23)
ot

where p(r,t) and j(r,t) are the probability density and the fractional probability
current. density vector, respectively, defined as

p(r,t) = W*(r, t)W(r, t), (2.24)

D
i(r,t) = oP y(n, 1)(—RA)2-VH(r, t) — W(r, t)(—RA)*/2-! VU" (r, t)]. (2.25)
i
In the present study only stationary problems in one dimension are considered,
which requires rewriting the time-dependent SFSE (2.18) in the time-independent

form. This can be made possible by treating W(x, t) as a wave function that describes



a stationary state with energy F and considering the case when V(z, t) = V(r). Then
W(x, 4) can be expressed as (12, 23, 24]

W(x, t) = exp (~$) (a), (2.26)

where (x) is time independent. Substituting this to Eq. (2.18) yields the stationary
SFSE:

Da(-R?A)*74(x) + V(x)¥(a) = Ev(z). (2.27)
As first applications of the SFSE, Laskin |12, 14| studicd problems such as a free
particle in square infinite potential well, energy spectrum of a hydrogen-like atom
(“fractional Bohr atom”), and energy spectrum of a fractional oscillator.

2.1.2 Momentum representation of the space-fractional Schroédingex
equation

In analogy with standard quantum mechanics, there also exists a momentum
representation of the SFSE. Replacing (—A?V)°/?4(zx) and #(x) in Eq. (2.27) with
Fourier-integral definitions (2.19) and (2.14), respectively, in steady-state form with
p — p’; multiplying both sides by e *?7/"; and integrating from z = —oo to z = 00
with orders of integration in p’ and x interchanged, one can write

Def dpi") ( / ef mM) + [ay ( / e-INY (cya) i)
= B | dp')(p') (/ eo-P*Mar) .

(2.28)
Then by definition and properties of the Dirac delta,

ys) = go fv dw, slow) = hv), sev) = [Feds vay,
(2.29)
Eq. (2.28) becomes

QrhDa\p|°y(p) + / * dp! ( / ” ci -P=IY a)de v(p') =2nhEW(p) (2.30)

Defining the Fourier transform V(p) of the potential V(x) and the Fourier convolution
(V *¥)(p) of V(p) and ¥(p) as

V(p) = [ 6 PPV (x) dex, (2.31)


(Vio) = [ Vip-eweryay. (2.32)
the SFSE in the momentum representation is finally obtained [23, 25]:
a7 V ia wb 7,
Daiples(p) + TEMP) = wip) (2.33)

This expression serves as the basic working equation in the analysis of bound states
(Chapters 3 and 5) and obtaining scattering-state wave functions (Chapter 5) of
Dirac-d potentials.

2.2 Some recent development

After Laskin’s pioneering work [11, 12, 13, 14] several authors attempted to
apply it to other fractional quantum systems or even make variants of fractional
Schrédinger equation such as the time-fractional Schrédinger equation (TFSE) and
the more generalized form, the space-time fractional Schrodinger equation (STFSE).

2.2.1 Time-fractional and space-time fractional Schrédinger

equations

Naber [6] constructed a TFSE in analogy with the fractional Fokker-Planck equa-
tion and found equivalence with the standard Schrodinger equation but with a time
dependent Hamiltonian that is nonlocal in time. He proposed two options of TFSE
expressed in terms of Planck units:

L2

(iTp)*Dyb = —ay- rv + Nuvo, (2.34)
L2

i(Tp)’Dit = — 557-0 + Nv, (2.35)

where

h
by =f t= My = fo Mp = My, (2.36)

are the Planck units of length, time, mass, and energy, respectively, with G and c
being the gravitational constant and speed of light. N, = m/M, and Ny = V/E,
are dimensionless parameters denoting the number of Planck masses in m and the


number of Planck energies in V, respectively. D/ is the vth-order Caputo fractional
derivative (4, 6]:

Di f(t) ren I Gasp ( ae ) ar (k-1<v<hk). (2.37)

This TFSE was solved for the free particle and potential well problems. Unlike the
SFSE, Naber [6] found out that the probability was non-conserved, and it increased
over time to a v-dependent limiting value. Iomin [26], on the other hand, formulated a
TFSE analogous to the fractional diffusion equation by a simple replacement 0/0t >
0” /Ot” (a < 1) and realized that this led to an essentially deficient description of
quantum dynamics. To circumvent this inefficiency, he introduced the quantum comb
model (QCM) and showed that at a = 1/2 the TFSE is a particular case of the QCM.
He then calculated a Green’s function suitable for a path-integral analysis of the free-
particle problem as an example.

Following Naber’s work [6], Wang and Xu [27] constructed a generalized fractional
Schrédinger equation with fractional derivatives in both space and time. Using the
same Planck units (2.36), they expressed the STFSE as

Lt
Va + Nyy, (2.38)

(:T,)”Dyp = ~9N

where D/ is the Caputo fractional derivative defined in Eq. (2.37) with k = 1 and
V# is the pth-order Riesz fractional derivative [4, 27]:

i? 1 ¢ (7
Vi l(t) = 73 P@-n / _ zl cer (1 <p <2). (2.39)
As applications they solved it for free-particle and square potential well problems
using integral-transform methods such as Fourier and Laplace. They also obtained
the Green’s function for a free particle and discussed the relationship between the
generalized STFSE cases and the standard quantum ones. Another version of the
STFSE was made by Dong and Xu [7] after deriving it from the dimensionless form
of the SFSE using also the Planck units (2.36). Their STFSE reads

DoT? 2

(*T, PDP w(x, t) = Vina Pay 2-20
pet Mi-2F912-2

V(a,t
(-RA)*? W(x, t) + VED a, 1. (2.40)
Pp
Considering time-independent potentials they studied the behavior of time evolution
of space-time fractional quantum systems in two cases of time-fractional derivative

orders of 0 < 3 < 1 and 1 < 3 < 2. Dividing the STFSE with V(z,t) = V(x) by
separate space and time equations, they obtained a general solution that contains


oscillatory and decaying terms. An interesting result is that upon investigating the
time limits of the total probability and particle’s energy levels as / + 00, they found
out that the total probability can be greater or less than 1, signifying that the STFSE
can describe a quantum system for non-conservative probability and that particles
may be absorbed by or extracted from the potentials. In Ref. [8] a STFSE with a
nonlocal potential is considered where the Green’s and wave functions are expressed in
terms of Fox’s /J-function by Fourier- and Laplace-transform methods. The authors
noted the strong influence of space-fractal and nonlocal parameters on the fractal
quantum system considered and found out that the nonlocal potential may act on
the same way as a fractional space or time derivative.
More recently, Bayin [5] formulated a STFSE in analogy with the space-time
fractional Bloch equation by an inverse Wick rotation ¢ > it which he wrote as
" Ww J "D h ay" r
ate (x, t) = i a, 3 ( x) W(z. t) _ ZV (a, t). (2.41)
where 0 < a < 1 and 1 < 3 < 2. This reduces to Laskin’s SFSE (2.17) when
a =1. To illustrate applications he considered the particle in a box problem for the
time-fractional case and gave the free-particle solution for the space-time fractional
case in terms of Fox’s H-function [21]. Finally, he introduced the effective potential
approach in solving the fractional Schrédinger equation.

2.2.2 Other quantum systems and the controversy in space-

fractional quantum mechanics

Perhaps, among the variants of fractional quantum mechanics discussed in the
previous section, Laskin’s formulation (11, 12, 13, 14] of (space-)fractional quantum
mechanics is the most studied in this field. Aside from earlier applicalions of the
SFSE [12, 13, 14] several other quantum systems are considered in the FQM litera-
ture. Gno and Xu |22| solved the SFSE for a free particle and an infinite square well
potential. They also discussed the barrier penetration problem, calculated the reflec-
tion and transmission coefficients of a particle from a rectangular wall potential, and
obtained a Green’s function for quantum scattering problem. Using the momentum-
representation method, Dong and Xu [23] studied the SFSE with a linear potential
where they obtained the energy levels and expressed the wave function in terms of
the H-function, a 6-function potential where they found a unique energy level and
even-parity bound-state wave function (expressed also in terms of the H-function),
and a Coulomb potential where they also found the energy levels and expressed the
wave function in an integral form. In Ref. [24] they discussed some applications of
the continuity and discontinuity of a fractional derivative of the wave function to


fractional quantum mechanics where they derived a jump condition for the fractional
derivative of the wave function in an infinite potential (sce Chapter 4.1). Using a
piecewise approach they solved the SFSE with a finite square potential, a periodic
potential, and a 6-function potential. Their results include realization of more parity
stales compared to those in standard quantum mechanics for the finile square po-
tential well, showing the validity of Bloch’s theorem and revealing the energy band
structure for the periodic potential, and an expression of a wave function for particle
in a d-well potential different from that obtained in Ref. [23]. Also they considered a
Dirac-comb potential and showed the structure of its energy band.

With the exception of the analysis of the Dirac-6 potential in Ref. [23], the cited
papers above used the piecewise approach extensively in studying the SFSE for the
quantum systems mentioned. Recently, Jeng et al. [28] raised an issue regarding
the validity of such an approach. They argued that some of the claimed solutions
ignore the inherent nonlocality of the quantum Riesz fractional derivative, rendering
the SFSE unsolvable in the usual piecewise manner. They referred in particular to
the ground-state solution for the one-dimensional infinite square well of Laskin [12]
and Guo and Xu [22]:

¥o(x) = Acos(na/2a), || <a (2.42)

0, otherwise.

After Fourier transforming this, they obtained the quantum Riesz fractional derivative
of yo(x) as

2A (mh\* [° p* 1 1px
—h2A)/2 ah = fo = oa
(—h° A)? uho(2) (=) [ a 78 (57) cos ( 2a ) ; (2.43)

where, even without evaluating, they noted the manifestation of nonlocality in this
fractional derivative and argued on the inconsistency of the solutions inside and out-
side the well. Bayin [29, 30] re-analyzed this consistency problem and showed that
the piecewise solutions are indeed consistent by directly evaluating the integral above.
Hawkins and Schwarz [31], however, pointed out the absence of an analytic integrand
in the contour integration made by Bayin (29, 30], which invalidates his results. The
most recent effort to shed some light on this controversy as of this writing is made
also by Bayin [32] where he revisited the problem of infinite square well and the
ways how integrals in Ref. [29] are evaluated. He still concluded that there are no
inconsistencies in these solutions even in using other representation such as the mo-
mentum space and different representations of the Riesz fractional derivative provided
consistent. assumptions are considered.


Chapter 3

Bound states for multiple Dirac-6

wells

In this chapter, using the momentum representation method, the space-fractional
Schrodinger equation for a system with N Dirac-d wells is solved. It is shown that
the problem of obtaining eigenergies of this system can be reduced to problem of
obtaining the eigenvalues of an N x N matrix. Explicit expressions for bound-state
energies and wave functions for N = 1, 2,3 are then calculated as illustrations.

3.1 Attractive Dirac comb

Let us consider a particle in an array of attractive Dirac-o wells with uniform
strength g > 0 and spacing a:
N-1
V(z)= ~9 )> 6(x — na). (3.1)
n=0
This is a toy model of an electron interacting with N nuclei of identical atoms [33].
Taking its Fourier transform using Eq. (2.31) gives

The Fourier convolution integral is

Substituting this to Eq. (2.33) one now has an expression for a(p):

3.2 Reduction of eigenenergy problem to a matrix

eigenvalue problem

For ease of comparison of the results, some of the notation used by de Oliveira et
al. [25] is adapted, i-e., defining for bound states

N= be (E<0), a= ne (3.5)
Cam fo emmitotyay, (3.6)
so that Eq. (3.4) can be conveniently written as
bn) = — 2 x Cerner! (3.7)

When n = 0, one has from Eq. (3.6)

Substituting Eq. (3.4) to this expression one obtains

3.3 [llustrative examples

In this section N = 1,2, 3 delta wells are considered to demonstrate an application
of the formulation discussed in the previous section. The single- and double-delta
potentials were already discussed in Refs. (23] and [25], but are reconsidered here for
cross-validation.

3.3.1 N=1 well

Consider first. the case of a single Dira-d potential well. For this problem Eqs.
(3.18) and (3.19) give ToCo = A.Co, and thus Ag = Tp. Then from Eq. (3.12),

Na =2 [ dg (3.21)
0 ati
From definition Eq. (3.20), this can also be expressed as

2 are f =1. 3.22
7 0 gti (3-22)

Using the integral formula (Ref. [25]; see also Eq. (3.241.2) of Ref. [34])

° dq _a t

[ Pt” aoe (=) (a > 1), (3.23)

Eq. (3.22) becomes
Qn la T\
aad! “esc (=) =1. (3.24)


Then the energy £, noting definition (3.5), is
a/(a-1)
ana

The wave function b(p) directly follows from Eq. (3.4) for N = 1, ie., Wp) =
%qCo(|p|* + A*)~}. Inverse Fourier transforming this using Eq. (2.14) yields

aCo f eipr/h
ov [pit + Ae

dp. (3.26)

The integral above can be written in the same form as integral (3.12), multiplied by
the factor \! ”, with n = 1 and a = 7, i.e.,

YaCo l-ar
(a) = —— r wy). 2
va) = PEP or, (a/h)e) (3.27)
Normalization, adapting the technique of de Oliveira et al. [25], is facilitated by
using the expression for 7(p) instead of 4)(:;) since the former has much simpler form
compared to that of the latter and by applying Parseval’s theorem:

[ v@v@a =<, fe ovioer. (3.28)

Evaluating the integral T;((A/h)z) in terms of Fox’s H-function [21] (see Appendix
B) and using another integral formula (see Eq. (33) of Ref. [25] and Eq. (3.241.5) of
Ref. [34])

where the normalization constant A, is given by

3.3.2 N =2 wells

Equation (3.18) for the double Dirac-6 well takes on the form

To T, C C
a *)=a,{ © ). (3.32)
T, Ty Gy Cy
Nontrivial solutions can be obtained upon imposing the condition det(T — AI) = 0,
with I being the 2 x 2 identity matrix, that is,
A2 — 2ToA, + (TZ — T?) = 0. (3.33)
Solving this for A, gives Ag = Ty + T;, which can also be written as #T(Aa/h) =

T(0)—A*"!/4. Moreover, rescaling the parameters as € = a\/hand R = 27h* D,/(a°~

leads to
#T(e) = T(0) — Re*", (3.34)
which is comparable to Eq. (76) of Ref. [25]. The intersection points of the pair
of curves —T'(c), 7(0) — Re®"! and T(e), 7(0) — Re®~! correspond to the ground and
excited states, respectively.
The wave function in the momentum representation follows from Eq. (3.7) for
N=2:

j co (2 oe 3.35
0) = rats (SA +e) (3.35)

where UJ; = C,/Co. Solving the system of equations (3.32) one finds that C; = +Co
and thus U, = +1. Inverse Fourier transforming the expression above gives 7(z):

a(x) = 7200 ys *1T,((A/A)x) + T1((A/R) (a — a))). (3.36)

In terms of the H-function, this can be expressed as

3.3.3 N =3 wells

As the last example the case of three delta wells is considered. The matrix
equation (3.18) for this system is given by

To Ty Te Co Co
T, To Ti Cy = Ag Cy . (3.40)
To T, To Cy Co

The eigenvalues of the T-matrix are

Nao = To — Ta,

1 1
Aa = To + 5T2 t svi t+ 8T. (3.41)

which can be written in terms of the same scaling relation used in Eq. (3.34) as
follows:

T(2e) = T(0) — Re??. (3.42)
T (2c) + 2T(0) — 2Re?-! = +\/T?(2) + 8T2(). (3.43)

Figure 3.1 plots the curves T(2c) and T(0) — Re®~! as functions of € for some values
of a and R = 2, while Fig. 3.2 displays curves of T(2e) + 2T(0) — 2Re*"! and
T?(2c) + 872(c). The bound-state cuergics can be identificd as the intersection
points of these curves. In Fig. 3.2 the difference between the energies of the two
states is smallest for a = 1.6; hence, it is expected that as @ decreases further the
energy difference completely vanishes.
The corresponding wave function y(z) is given by

w(x) = eC y1-2F 7, ((A/R):) + W,T)((A/A) (0 — a)) + WoT ((A/R) (a — 2a))}, (3-44)

where W, = C/Co and W2 = C2/Co. So that (x) be normalized to unity,

qaCo = Vth F-*/?(a, Wy, Wo), (3.45)


Figure 3.1: Plots of the functions in Eq. (3.42) for 2. = 2 and some values of a.

T(aA/h) = [ ; =p/d. 3.46

Thus, the normalized wave function reads,

where A,3 = Vnr/hF-/?(a, W,, W2) is the normalization constant and

3.3.4 N>4 wells

For cases of higher numbers of delta wells, obtaining the bound states is concep-
tually straightforward from Eq. (3.18). Since it constitutes a system of homogeneous
linear equations, it is necessary to impose the condition det(T — A,I) = 0 to obtain
nontrivial solutions. The corresponding bound-state wave functions can be directly
obtained by inverse Fourier transforming Eq. (3.7), that is, in terms of Fox’s H-
function

v(a) = Beate” Cua | (a/R) 2 — nal

Figure 3.2: Plots of the functions in Eq. (3.43) for R = 2 and some values of a.

Nevertheless, there remains the problem of obtaining the roots of the secular equation
of Eq. (3.18) and normalizing the above expression for higher numbers of delta wells.

3.4 Verification of the bound-state solutions ob-

tained using the momentum-space approach

As a prior step, the solution of the space-fractional Schrédinger equation (SFSE)
with N = 1 Dirac-6 well is considered. In the position representation, this reads

D,(-RA)?*? h(x) — g(x) p(x) = Ey (2). (3.50)

Using the momentum-space method, the bound-state solution is obtained as given by
Eq. (3.30) with the corresponding energy in Eq. (3.25). At z # 0 (that is, away from
the singularity), the SFSE for this system becomes

D,(-RA)?h(2) = Ey (z). (3.51)

Validity of the momentum-space approach warrants showing that the above equal-
ity holds when the solution obtained in Chapter 3.3.1 is substituted back into this
expression. For convenience, such a solution, which is expressed in terms of Fox’s
H-function, is rewritten in its integral representation as follows:

co eipz/h
W(x) = K., ——— dp, 3.52
Wa) = Ko [ope ee)


Figure 3.3: Plots of the wave function ~/A,,3 given in Eq. (3.47) as a function of

J, = Dal-WA)*"Y{e) = Ke [SPE ap, (3.53)

At this point, it is suggestive to rewrite the SFSE in the momentum representation
[Eq. (2.33)] as

Da\p|* = RE +E. (3.55)

Plugging this into Eq. (3.53) and noting that, for N = 1 delta well, (V«b)(p) = —gCo
and ¢:(p) = YaCo(|p|* + A*)~! lead to

Keg [™ gre =

Since only the region x ¥ 0 is considered, the first term in the above equation becomes
zero, which shows equivalence of Eqs. (3.53) and (3.54) and hence proves equality
(3.51).


It is possible to extend this verification for N’ Dirac-é wells as considered in this
chapter. In regions where 1: # nu (1 = 0,1.2,...), the SFSE has the same form as
Eq. (3.51). The left (Jpw) and right (Jpn) sides of this equation become

Kan N-1 ;
Jin = 2% SW, (a — na) + Edy(2), Jen = Evn(z), (3.57)

where in terms of its integral representation

Wn(z) = Aan Wa f ———— dp, 3.58

where A,,v is the normalization constant,W, = Cp/Co, and Kw = (20) At TAL.
Clearly, in the regions of interest, the summation over n of the Dirac-6 functions in
Jin vanishes, satisfying Eq. (3.51).

Whether the obtained solutions are legitimate bound states as claimed also de-
serves some attention. To verify this, the condition (xz) + 0 as x — oo must be
satisficd. Thus, the analysis of the behavior near infinity of the //-function

(1-1/a,1),(1/2,a/2)
Be [osm (3.59)
(0,a),(1—1/a,1),(1/2,a/2)
that appears in the solution is needed. First, note that it has the following parameters:
m=2, n=1, p=2, q=3, (3.60)

Using the formulas for the asymptotic expansion of the H-function discussed in Ap-
pendix A, the following values are obtained: A = a > 0, AX = 1 > 0. Thus, with the
additional condition |arg{(A/h)"|z|"}| = 0 < 2/2 satisfied, d = max(—1/a, —1/@) =
—1/a and hence (defining |2’| = A|z|/h)

(1 fen) (1/2,e2/2)

| ~|2'[. |2'| >> 1. (3.63)
(0.a),(1—1/a.1),(1/2.0/2)

It follows that as r — oo, ¥(xz) — 0, which implies that (x) is a bound-state
solution. This behavior of w(x) can be seen in Fig. 3.3 for the case of N = 3 Dirac-é
wells. It is also noteworthy that since y(z) is normalized, this guarantees that

/ ~ |w(x)|?dx < 00. (3.64)

co

which is another condition for bound-state solutions.

3.5 Summary

Bound states for multiple Dirac-6 wells in the framework of fractional quantun
mechanics are obtained. It is accomplished by introducing an attractive Dirac-comt
potential to the space-fractional Schrédinger equation. It is also shown that the
problem of obtaining eigenenergies of a system with N Dirac-6 wells can be reducec
to a problem of obtaining the eigenvalues of an N x N matrix. As examples the cases
of single- and double-delta wells are reconsidered and extended the application to <
triple Dirac-6 well. Verification of the solutions obtained using the momentum-space
approach and their validity as bound-state solutions is also presented.

Chapter 4

Transmission through locally

periodic potentials

In this chapter, transmission through identical barriers is studied. Specifically, the
transmission probabilities T(N) of a particle in a chain of N Dirac-6 barriers (Dirac
comb) and, as another case, a chain of N square barriers are calculated. To obtain
explicit expressions for T(V), the transfer-matrix (M-matrix) formulation of Grifliths
and Steinke [16] is adapted.

4.1 Discontinuity condition for the space-fractional

derivative of the wave function

Dong and Xu [24] derived the discontinuity condition for space-fractional deriva-
tive of the wave function. For later purpose it is outlined here. If the integral of the
time-independent space-fractional Schrodinger equation

Da(— RPA)? yh(x) + V(x) ye(2) = F(x) (4.1)

is evaluated over x in the range [zo — €.%o + €] for some « > 0, this leads to (see
Appendix C for details)

dyp(sx) |?" out
WD (—way | =f B-V(@)lw(e)ae. (4.2)
~ m-«6 To-€
Moreover, if V(x) is finite and (zx) is bounded in [9 — €, x9 + €] then
lim Faab(a) [Ets = 0, (4.3)



where ,
Fo = (—RA)?2 (4.4)

dx
which implies that §,~(x) is continuous at z = Zp and likewise everywhere continuous

for V(x) finite. If V(z) is infinite such as the Dirac-d potential
V(z) = gd(x- 20), 9 > 0. (4.5)

with g being the strength of the potential, §.7(zr) is no longer continuous. Sub-
stituting this potential to Eq. (4.2) and taking the limit as « — 0 yields such a
discontinuity:

Farh(zG) — Farh(zo) = (9/h Da) (a0). (4.6)
The continuity and discontinuity conditions for §,(zx) derived above are applied to
obtain the relations leading to the transmission coefficients for square and Dirac-6
barriers.

4.2 Transfer-matrix formulation

Grifliths and Steinke [16] formulated a generic expression for the transfer matrix
M by considering an arbitrary localized potential and applied it to obtain transmis-
sion coeflicients for periodic potentials. Their approach is adapted here for applica-
tion to space-fractional quantum mechanics (SFQM) where delta-function and square
barriers are considered.

Let the arbitrary potential V(x) be restricted to the interval (a,b). In the force-
free region, the space-fractional Schrédinger equation reads

Da(-WA)?(z) = Ev(z). (4.7)

By applying the definition of the Riesz fractional operator, it can be shown that the
solutions are

v(x) =

{ Ae**ket + Be~*¥e®™ og <a (4.8)

Feet + Ge7tke™, og > B,

where

Bb \ue
ka = € = (4.9)

The solution in the interval « < 1: < ) will depend on the structure of V(:r), and once
known the amplitudes (A, B) in the region z < a can be expressed in terms of the

amplitudes (F,G) in the region z > b in the form like

A ad MF + MG,

In matrix form this converts to

A F Mu M
=M , M=[{ 7 —? ). (4.11)
B G My, My

with M being the transfer matrix. If the conjugate of Eq. (4.1) is taken, assuming
that V(z) is real, then the following are also solutions to Eq. (4.7):

. Ate kat 4. Br etkat r<a
v'(2) = { (4.12)

Frethat 4 Gretkot or > b,

where k,, is given by Eq. (4.9) and the asterisk (*) denotes complex conjugate. This
modifies the amplitudes of the incoming and outgoing waves, and Eq. (4.11) becomes

B My M. G

_ 11 12 ; (4.13)
At Moy Mop F
A Mg, Mg F

_ 22 21 ; (4.14)
B Mey Mi, G

upon comparing Eqs. (4.11) and (4.14).

Now consider the consequence of the conservation of the number of particles. The
fractional probability current density j(r) in Eq. (2.25) can be expressed in one
dimension as

Furthermore,

It is evident that

j(z) = —iDohlh"(z)Fa(z) — V(x) Fay" (z)]. (4.16)

Moreover, since the particle population must be conserved, j(xr) at 2 = 0, for example,
requires

j(2)|2=0+ = j(£)|z=0-- (4.17)

Substituting solutions (4.8) and (4.12) to Eq. (4.16), with a = b = 0 and using the

formula
%ertiker = Hike AI 2etiker (4.18)

the probability current densities in the two regions are found to be
(2) |e<or = 2D2(hika)* MIF? — IGP),
j(2)|2-0- = 2Da(hka)**(|A)? — |BI?). (4.19)
Imposing the continuity condition (4.17) leads to the equality
[PP -|GP = |AP - [BP. (4.20)

This can be represented as a matrix:

(A B)(| JZ)-@ 7)(} °)(E). (4.21)

Using Eq. (4.11) and its complex conjugate it can be shown that

(4 B)(' “\)-¢ a ym ( Se (S). (4.22)

where M? denotes the transpose of M. Thus, comparison of the above two equations

yields
7{ 1 0 . 1 0
M M* = . (4.23)
0 -1 0 -i1

One unique constraint can be drawn, i.e.,
|Mi1|? — |Mi2\? = 1, (4.24)

which also translates to det(M) = 1. Combining results (4.15) and (4.24), a general
form of the transfer matrix is obtained:

My, ™M,
M= u M2 )_({ uv jul? — jw? = 1. (4.25)
Mi. My, vou

Given the M matrix above for a single site, construction of the transfer matrix
M(N) for the whole array of N evenly spaced sites is possible. One way is to express
it as a product of the M matrices of the individual sites:

(;) ()-men(e)
= MyMy-1---M; = M(N) , (4.26)
B G G

with

N
M(N) =MwyMy-1---Mi = [[ Mj. (4.27)
j=l

In Ref. [17] M(N) was evaluated in the case of a chain of Dirac-é barriers (Dirac
comb) and came up with a closed-form expression in terms of the type II Chebyshev
polynomials. Consistent. with this result is a generalization given by Griffiths and
Steinke [16] that is applicable to any periodic potential. For completeness their results
are detailed here, but in the realm of space-fractional quantum mechanics.

Suppose that the single site, restricted to the interval (—:ro,:ro), is repeated N
times with a separation distance s > 2x9. Let w(x) be the (free-particle) wave
function between these sites. Then 7,(x) can be expressed as

Wale) = Ack ns) 4. 73, oo tRale—ns) (4.28)

where k, = (E/D,h%)!/* in the present context and (n — 1)s + 4 < 2 < ns — 20,
with 0 <n < N. The wave functions in the leftmost (n = 0) and rightmost (n = N)
sides of the array are

wo(z) = Ageike™ + Boe~**#7,
dn (x) = Aycikelt-Ns) 4 Bye ike Ns). (4.29)

From Eq. (4.28) it follows that the relationship between two adjacent wave functions

is given by
An An —-ikas
=mM[ oe (4.30)
Bn Bn4iei*es
or, equivalently,

An An —ikas wpikas
=P(" |) pal |. (4.31)
B, Bn4i pyre ikas u* eikas

where P is the shifted matrix, and by referring to the constraint in Eq. (4.25)
det(P) = 1; hence, P is unimodular like M. Moreover,

e ikas 0 \
P=MA, A= . (4.32)

0 eikas

The amplitudes of the wave functions 9 and yy are connected by applying Eq. (4.31)
iteratively:

Bo B, Bo Bs Bn


Evaluation of M(N) therefore requires determining P% first, and from Eq. (4.32)
M(N) can be calculated directly by using the inverse of matrix A recursively applied
N times. That is,

M(N) = PX(A7)%, are ° ) (4.34)

0 ev ikas

A preliminary step in evaluating P™ considers the characteristic equation of the
matrix P. If p is the eigenvalue, then det(P — Ip) = 0, where I is the identity matrix.
This expression is equivalent to p? — pTr(P) + det(P) = 0 or ,since det(P) = 1,

p?—26p+1=0, 6==TY(P). (4.35)

From Eq. (4.31), 6 = }(ue 5 + uel"), and by writing u = w+ iz it can be shown
that

(0) = Re(u) cos(kas) + Im(u) sin(kas). (4.36)
In accordance with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, the characteristic relation (4.35)
is satisfied by the P matrix itself:

P? = 26P —1. (4.37)

This implies that any power of P can be reduced to a linear combination of P and I,
leading to a closed-form expression for the Nth power of any modular 2 x 2 matrix:

PX = PUy_1(8) — IUy_2(8), (4.38)

where Uy(0) is an Nth-degree polynomial in 9. Multiplying P on both sides of the
above equation and equating it to the result of shifting the index of the same Eq.
(4.38) by N + N+] leads to the recursion relation for type II Chebyshev polynomials
[35]:

Un 42(0) — 26Un41(8) + Un (0) = 0. (4.39)
where Eq. (4.37) is used to substitute for P? and

sin(N + 1)y7
siny °

Finally, substituting Eq. (4.38) [with definition (4.31) for P] to Eq. (4.34) directly
evaluates M(N), i-e.,

Knowledge of the elements of the M matrix for a single site therefore suffices to obtain
an explicit form of the transfer matrix M(N) for N such sites.

In considering transmission from the left and setting G = 0, Eqs. (4.2), (4.11).
and (4.15) give an expression for the transmission coefficient. for a single site as T(1) =
|F\?/|A|? = |Afial-? = (1+|Mio|?)-! = (14+|v|?)~!. Hence, for N sites it follows from
Eqs. (4.40) and (4.41) that the transmission coefficient can be written generically as
=i

Transmission maximum and minimum

It follows from Eq. (4.42) that transmission resonance [i.e, T(N) = 1] occurs
when sin Ny = 0, which consequently gives the resonance condition Ny = 17, where
n=1,2,3...,N —1. Thus, from Eqs. (4.36) and (4.40),

cos(nm/N) = Re(u) cos(kas) + Im(u) sin(kas), n= 1,2,3,.... N-1. — (4.48)

It is also possible to express T(N) in terms of T(1) and deduce another condition
for perfect transmission by eliminating v from Eq. (4.42) using the expression |v|? =
T-'(1) — 1. That is,

Evidently, when T(1) = 1, maximum transmission takes place. Conversely, minimum
transmission occurs when sin Ny = 1. This gives

T, 14 ' ji | (= >i (4.45)

Applications to SFQM of the M matrix to studying transmission through Dirac-é
and square barriers are discussed in the sections that follow.

4.3 Dirac-6 barriers

Consider a Dirac-6 barrier potential of the form given by Eq. (4.5) centered at
zo = 0. In the region where V(x) = 0, the solutions to the fractional Schrédinger
equation (4.7) are given by

Aeket + Be~*ke™, ot <0
v(x) = (4.46)

Fetkot + Ge-*e?, a > 0.


Imposing the continuity (4.3) and discontinuity (4.6) conditions at x = 0 of ¥(r) and
Ba (x), respectively, and using formula (4.14) yield the pair of equations

F+G=A+B,

, y . 9 . g
( aceisin) (1+ 55h) B (4.47)

For a wave incident to the left, assuming no incoming wave in the region «+ > 0
(G = 0), solving for the reflected and transmitted amplitudes B and F, respectively,
in terms of the incident amplitude A gives

_ _wig(2Dake- he) F 1

~ 1+ 19(2Dakehe)-)? ~ 1+ %9(2Dak2- the)?

The transmission coefficient is

A. (4.48)

~ 14 g?(2Dake ar) 2°
Comparison with Eq. (4.42) and using the condition |u|? — |v|? = 1 [Eq. (4.25)], the

elements of the transfer matrix are

u=1+ig(QD keh), v= ig(2D ke the). (4.50)

T(1)

(4.49)

Explicit form of the transfer matrix (4.25) for a single Dirac-6 barrier can be con-
structed as follows:

1+ ig(2D,k2-h°)-! — ig(2Dke- hh) 7}
ma ( 1+ i9(2Daka"R*) 19(2Dakz*h*) (4.51)
—ig(2Dakehe)-) 1 — ig(2Dgk2 he)

For N Dirac-6 barriers the transfer matrix M(N) is given by Eq. (4.41) with u and
v given in Faqs. (4.50). The transmission coefficient. [Fiq. (4.42)] is

: 2771
T(N) = f + 9?(2Dako- 1h?) ? () ; (4.52)
sin 7
where from Eqs. (4.36), (4.40), and (4.50)
7 = cos! [cos(kes) + g(2Dake-1h*)“! sin(kas)]. (4.53)

This same expression for the Bloch phase of Dirac comb in SFQM is also obtained
in Ref. [24] by applying Bloch’s theorem. In terms of the energy E and defining

Ba = py “h the above two expressions can be rewritten as

. 2] }
T(N) = + steaasetomy (2%) (4.54)

sin y


+ = cos "[cos(3,,1 E's) + 9(23,E 9/7) 'sin(a,1E/"s)). (4.55)
Transmission resonance takes place when either of the two conditions discussed in the
previous section is satisfied. From Eq. (4.43), one has

cos(nm/N') = cos(,351 Es) + 9(2,3,.E(-)/2)-! sin(3, 1 B'/4s), (4.56)

where n = 1,2,3,...,N —1. Another condition such that T(1) and hence T(J’) [Eq.
(4.44)] approach maximum is B >> (g/23,)¢/@7)).

Figure 4.1 shows plots of the transmission coefficients for N = 2,4,10 Dirac-d
barriers as functions of energy F for three values of the Lévy index (@ = 1.8, 1.9, 2.0)
considered. In all these plots the value of the generalized diffusion coefficient is
taken as D, = v?~*/am*"!, where v is the characteristic velocity of non-relativistic
quantum system chosen to be 1.0 x 1075c, where c is the speed of light in vacuum
(for more details, see Sec. V of Ref. [23]). To clearly show the shapes of the curves
up to the maximum transmission (T = 1), the values are set ash =c=m=s=1

Dirac-6 barriers for a = 1.8 (first column), a = 1.9 (second column), and a = 2.0
(third column).

Some remarkable features are worth noting in these plots. The difference between
the fractional (a = 1.8,1.9) and non-fractional (a = 2) regimes is apparent even for


a small number of barriers such as N’ = 2 and becomes even more pronounced as N
increases. For N 2 the transmission cocfficiemt curves arc more rapidly oscillating
in the fractional regime, giving more transmission maximum and minimum points.
[Figure 4.2 shows the locus of these transmission minima, given by Eq. (4.45), for
N = 10 barriers as dotted curves.| The immediate emergence of bandlike structures,
which is a characteristic of periodic potentials [17], can also be observed even for a
small number of barriers of as low as N = 4 and is much more obvious for lower
values of a. These band structures correspond to the allowed energies, separated
by valleys of forbidden energies (gaps) which approach the value of T = 0 as N
becomes larger. As a decreases the number of allowed energy regions increases but
become more squeezed or closer to each other and essentially form a continuum; such
a feature is evident in the curve of T(10) for w = 1.8. Lastly, although some of the
characteristics of energy band structures (such as the width and number of allowed
energy regions) in the fractional regime greatly vary from those of the non-fractional
one, the number of undulations on each hill of allowed energies remains constant at
N —1. For example, as shown in Fig. 4.2, each hill of the T(10) curves contains nine
undulations for all the three a’s.

4.4 Square barriers

As another application consider a finite (square) barricr potential V(r) = Vo
restricted to the interval (—z9, 20) and zero elsewhere. First, consider the case when
E > Vo. The space-fractional Schrodinger equation now reads

D.(-WA)??y(x) = (E — Vo)v(2), (4.57)


which has the solutions

Aetkat 4 Be~tkaz n< —20

Fetket + Ge7 thot x > Xo,
where
_ E _ Vo l/a

k ( Dake ) (4.59)

Since V(z) is finite both (x) and F.4:(x) are continuous at x = +29. Imposing such
continuity yields the following sets of equations:

Ac et 4 [eat — (1 cos(Kyatig) — D sin(Kyto),

i(ka/ ka)” 1(Ae 7° — Be'*™) = Csin(kato) — Dcos(kato), (4.60)

C cos(Ka2o) + Dsin(kato) = Fe'**? + Gee,
Dcos(kato) — C sin(ke2o) = i(ka/ka)* '(Fei**™ — Ge7**e™). (4.61)
where use has been made of the following formulas for §,,:
%., cos(kiyt) = —k27 AT? sin(k,x),
Fasin(kar) = kf 'A* ? cos(kez). (4.62)
Equations (4.61) are used to solve for C and D with the assumption G = 0:
C = Fe****°[cos(kato) — i(ka/ka)* ' sin(kat0)],
D = Fe*=°(sin(ka20) + t(ka/ka)* | cos(kaZo)]. (4.63)

Substituting these to Eqs. (4.60), the reflected and transmitted amplitudes are found

to be

For the chain of N’ such barriers the M matrix is given explicitly by Eq. (4.41) with
the corresponding clements in Eqs. (4.66). The transmission cocfficient for multiple
scattering expressed in terms of the original variables is given by

Aside from Eq. (4.69) another condition for the occurrence of transmission res-
onance in a square multibarrier system is given by Eq. (4.43). In Fig. 4.3 the
transmission coefficient is plotted as a function of E for N = 1,4, 10 square barriers.
In all plots, the strength of the potential is set to Vo = 5 and the distance between
adjacent barriers is assumed to be d = 1. All the other parameters have the same
values as those used in Figs. 4.1 and 4.2.

square barriers for a = 1.8 (first column), @ = 1.9 (second column), and a = 2.0
(third column).

Similar to the Dirac-6 multibarrier system, a common feature in these plots is the
formation of stronger forbidden bands as N gets larger. In the fractional regime, the
numbers of allowed and forbidden energy regions increase but become narrower as
compared to the standard ones. Consequently, the transmission coefficient curves in
this regime become more oscillatory and create stronger forbidden bands faster than
the case when a = 2. This can be clearly seen even when N = 1. Figure 4.4 shows


the transmission coefficient for N = 10 square barriers with close-up view of peaks
(that is, points where T = 1) and the locus of transmission minimum points. In the
energy range considered in this figure (E = 20-30), the T(10) curve for a = 2 has
wider plateaus, but contain less transmission peaks. These plateaus are separated by
a larger gap as compared to those of a = 1.8,1.9. Among the three T(10) curves,
that of a = 1.8 forms a more pronounced continuum as the plateaus are more closely
spaced.

a’s.

For the case when E < V, i.e., when transmission is improbable in classical
physics, the expressions for M matrix and T(N) can be obtained by the replacement
k, — K,, where k’, = (—1)'/*[(Vp — F)/1),,h°]!/ or, more conveniently, by writing

Limiting cases for E < Vo

Now consider the limiting cases of the above results for E < Vo. In the weak
tunneling limit, one has a high and wide barrier such that k.2%9 >> 1 (while assuming
sufficiently large distance d between adjacent barriers to avoid overlapping), and


approximately sinh(2k,20) * cosh(2k.29) & 27! exp(2k.20). Thus,

For a very narrow but high barrier, one has E << Vo, ka << Ka, and Kato << 1 but

Finally, from the above two expressions, if in the area under a square barrier (Vo x 2x9)
the limit as Vo > co, 29 — 0 is taken and then denote this area by g (i.e., strength of
a Dirac-é barrier), one recovers results (4.52) and (4.53) for the Dirac-é multibarrier
system.

4.5 Reduction of the generalized results to those

of standard quantum mechanics

and 3. = h/V2m. Using these expressions, the transmission coefficients obtained in
Ref. [16] in the framework of standard quantum mechanics for N Dirac-é barriers and
square barriers (E > Vo) are recovered. They are given, respectively, as follows:

. mg\?2 (sin Ny(a = 2) a7

Note that for N = 1, Eqs. (4.88), (4.90), and (4.92) exactly reduce to well-known
results in the analysis of transmission through a single rectangular barrier (see, for
example, Refs. [36] and [37]).

4.6 Summary

In this chapter transmission through locally periodic Dirac-6 and square barrier
potentials in one-dimensional fractal space has been studied. As a precursor to ob-
taining the expressions for the transmission coeflicient, the discontinuity condition for
the fractional derivative of the wave function, Ag?(z), for an infinite potential (24]
has been applied. Moreover, to obtain closed-form expressions of the transfer ma-
trix M and transmission coeflicient for N identical potentials, a technique originally
formulated by Griffiths and Steinke [16] has been adapted, but in the framework of
space-fractional quantum mechanics.

Transmission coefficient curves reveal an interesting feature of periodic potentials,
namely, the emergence of bandlike structures that correspond to the allowed energies
of the quantum system. These structures, separated by valleys of forbidden energies
which approach T = 0 as N becomes large, are more apparent in the fractional
regime (i.e., for a < 2) and appear even for a small number of barriers of N = 4. For
the system of Dirac-6 barriers, although some of the characteristics of energy band
structures such as the width and number of allowed energy regions in the fractional]
regime greatly vary from those of the non-fractional one, the number of undulations
on each hill of allowed energies remains constant at N — 1. Both cases of FE > Y
and E < Vp in the square multibarrier system have been considered. For the latte
case (E < Vo), a fractional generalization of the limiting cases of the square barrie1
potential has been presented, and it has been shown that when a = 2 well-known
results in the standard quantum mechanics can be recovered as a special case.

Chapter 5

Dipolar and quadrupolar Dirac-6é

potentials

In this chapter special cases of Dirac-é potentials with non-uniform strengths such as
the dipolar and quadrupolar Dirac-6 potentials are discussed.

5.1 Dipolar double Dirac-é potential
Consider a double Dirac-6 potential of the form
V(x) = Vo[6(z + a/2) + d(x — a/2)), (5.1)

where a is the internuclear distance and Vo and pVo are coupling parameters. De
Oliveira et al. [25] considered the case p = 1, i.e., a double delta barrier potential,
and found that bound-state solutions only exist when Vo = —y (g > 0), that is, a
double delta well (see Chapter 3.3.2) and a model of the molecular ion H} in the
one-dimensional limit. Here, the case j. = —1 is considered to model a dipole.

The Fourier transform and convolution of this potential with v(p) are given, re-
spectively, by

V(p) = Vo(ei?2/?" — @ P0/P), (5.2)
(V * w)(p) = Vole?*/"Ci (a) — e"”*?"C2(a)], (5.3)

where xo
Ci(a) = C2(—a) = [ 7 P/ha (y')dp! (5.4)



are constants. The wave function in the momentum representation is

In the next sections the cases E < 0 for bound state and E > 0 for scattering state
are treated separately.

5.1.1 Case lI: E <0

For this case define B

so that Eq. (5.5) becomes

Ya _|,ipa/2hey (4) — ¢ ‘2/200 (q)). (5.7)

Using this expression to find C;(a) and C2a leads to the system of linear homogeneous
equations cast in matrix form:

( -T(0) T(ad/h) ) (3° ) _A (2° ) (5.8)
-T(ad/h) (0) C2(a) “\ x(a) ]’
where
A= 741A" (5.9)

Nontrivial solution can be obtained upon imposing the condition det(T — AI) = 0,

where
o=( _T(0) sey) 1- (; *). (5.11)
-T(ad/h) (0) 01

This consequently leads to the energy equation given by
T?(ad/h) = T?(0) — A?. (5.12)
To represent graphically it is convenient to rescale the parameters as follows:

ar 2rh* Da
e= Th R= at 1% 5

(5.13)


The energy equation now becomes
T?(c) = T7(0) — Ra2OY, (5.14)
In Fig. 5.1 the curves T?(¢) and T?(0) — R?«2(2-)) are plotted on the same grid for

R= 2. The solution as determined graphically can be identified as the point. where
these curves intersect.

where W is the ratio (2(a)/C,(a). From the first equation in Eq. (5.8). C2(a) =
C,(a)[T(0) + Aa]/T(a\/h). On the other hand, the second equation gives C2(a) =
C,(a)T(ad/h)/[T(0) — Aa]. Thus,

Co(a) _ T(0) + Aa __T(ad/h)

= SOE 5.16
Ci(a)  T(ad/h) = T(0)—-Aa hae)
Simplifying the second equality leads to the relation
2) — A2
T*0) = Aa _ (5.17)

T2(aX/h)


which recovers the energy equation. Hence, one can set W = C2(a)/C,(a) = 1 upon
comparing the above two expressions. Moreover, on application of Parseval’s theorem
as in Chapter 3, the condition to which 7(z) is normalized to unity is found to be

aCi(a) = Vrh2-1G /?(qQ), (5.18)
where
G(a) = 2(a — 1)? a ese(a/a) — 41 (ad/h), (5.19)
_ [© costy4) _
T(y) = | Wet 1244 (q= p/d). (5.20)

After evaluating the integral of type T’(y) in terms of Fox’s H-function in Eq. (5.15),
introducing a suitable phase factor, and using condition (5.18) and that W = 1, the

5.2 Quadrupolar triple Dirac-d potential

Consider the interaction between an electron and a symmetric linear triatomic
molecule which potential is given by [20]

V(x) = Vo[d(z + a) — 26(z) + 6(x — a)], (5.33)

where Vo > 0 is the strength and a is the spacing between two adjacent atoms. Its
Fourier transform and convolution with w(p) are given, respectively, by

V(p) = Vo(et?/" — 2 + e**P/”), (5.34)
(V «v)(p) = Vole'*”/"Co(a) — 2C, (0) + e-*”/"C2(a)] (5.35)

where the constants are defined as
Cola) = Cx(-0) = [erie de, C0) =f WODar. (6.36

Substituting the expression for (V * »)(p) into the momentum representation of the
space-fractional Schrédinger equation, an expression for #(p) is obtained:

W(p) = pe pn Cala) - 2C (0) + e?/"C2(a)]. (5.37)

with 7, defined in Eq. (5.5). Below the TISFSE for two separate cases, namely,
E <0 and E > 0 is solved.

5.2.1 CaselI: F <0

For this case the same parameter defined in Eq. (5.6) is used to write 0(p) as

b(p) = pepe en nCola) — 2C,(0) + e-*”/*C,(a)]. (5.38)


Likewise when this expression is used to find Co(a), Ci(0), and C2(a), a system of
linear homogeneous equations cast in matrix form can be obtained, i.e.,

-T(0) = 2T(ad/h)  —T(2aX/h) Co(a) Co(a)
—-T(ad\/h) = 2T(0) = —T(aX/h) Ci(0) | =Aa}] Ci(0) |, (5.39)
—T(2aA/h) 2T(ad/h) —T(0) C2(a) C2(a)

To obtain nontrivial solutions the same condition det(T —.\,I) = 0 is imposed, where
in this case

-T(0) 2T(a\/h) —T(2aX/h) 100
T=| -T(a/h) 2T(0) —-T(ad/h) |. T=] 010 (5.40)
-T(2a\/h) 2T(ad/h) —T(0) 001

Then the relation satisfied by the bound-state energy, using the same scaling relations
in Eqs. (5.13) is

Re® A(e) = R88") — Bie), (5.41)

where
A(c) = 3T?(0) — 47? (0) + T?(20), (5.42)
B(c) = 2{T(0)(T?(0) — 2T?(e) — T?(2e)] + 2T?(€)T (2e)} (5.43)

Figure 5.3 shows plots of the functions f(a, ¢) = Re?! A(c) and g(a, ¢) = R&e8e-)) —
B(c) for R = 2 and some values of a. The corresponding eigenvalue for each a can be
identified as the ¢-coordinate of the point of intersection of the two curves. It is seen
that apart from the trivial « = 0 solution there is only one such point, and therefore
one unique eigenvalue for each a considered.

The wave function 7(x) can be obtained by inverse Fourier transforming Eq.
(5.38). One has

phase factor to y(x), the normalized wave function reads

W(x) = NQP(W (zx + a) — o(z) + Zd(x — a)]. (5.46)

where NOP = ,/r)/hJ-'/?(a, W, Z) is the normalization constant and the ¢’s are
given in Eq. (5.22). Figure 5.4 plots the wave function as given in Eq. (5.46) when
W=Z.

5.2.2 Case II: E>0

For this case the same parameter given by Eq. (5.23) and the property f(x)é(x) =

with the ¢’s defined in Eq. (5.32).

5.3 Verification of the scattering-state solutions ob-

tained using the momentum-space approach

Examples of scattering-state solutions, i.e., with E > 0, obtained using the
momentum-space approach are given by Eqs. (5.31) and (5.54). The same steps
employed in Chapter 3.4 are followed to verify these solutions. From Eq. (3.51),
define this time I, = (—h?A)?/*x)(x) and Ip = Ey(x). Expression (3.55) suggests

that
1 CF ~
=~ Oni I. eV « p)(p)dp + EV (2). (5.55)

For the dipolar double Dirac-é potential located at z = {—a/2,a/2}, this becomes
I, = -[KP6(x + a/2) — KP 5(x — a/2)| + Ey(z), (5.56)

where A’P = VoCi(a)/2ah and KP = VoC2(a)/27h. Away from the singularity, i.e.,
location of the potential, it is clear from the above equation that J, = Jp. For the
quadrupolar triple Dirac-é potential at 2 = {—«,0, a}, this can be written as

I, = -[K26(x + a) — K26(2) + KP4(x — a)] + Ev(z), (5.57)

where K2 = VoCo(a)/2mh, K2 = VoCi(0)/mh, and KP = VoC2(a)/2mh. Hence, at
xr # {—a,0. a}, I, = Tp.

As precursor to analyzing scattering by these potentials, it is necessary to know
the behavior near infinity of the following Fox’s //-functions that appear in the I; > 0
solutions:

7 (1 1/e41),(1 [244]/20,[2+6)/2)
Ha = Hy’ | (A/h)*|w|* ; (5.58)

with the following parameters:

for both H, and Hz, but with

for H, and

(a1, a2) = (1—1/a,1—-[2-—a}/2a), (Aj, Ae) = (1. [2 - a]/2), (5.63)

for Hy. Using the formulas in Appendix A, the following values are obtained for H4:
A=a>0, At =0,6=a%, A=1/(2ria), B= 0, C = 1, co = do = 2. For Hp,
A=a> 0, A* = 2a > 0, and d= —1/a. Thus,

5.4 Summary

In this chapter, special types of Dirac-d potentials with non-uniform strengths
are considered. The SFSE with a dipolar double Dirac-d potential and the one with a
quadrupolar triple Dirac-é potential are solved using the momentum-space approach.
The analysis is divided into two cases, namely, for E < 0 (bound state) and E > 0
(scattering state). In analogy with the first system, i-e., multiple Dirac-d wells, bound-
state energy equations are obtained by applying the condition det(T — A,I) = 0. The
wave functions for both potentials are expressed in terms of Fox’s H-function. For
both potentials one unique solution can be realized as dictated by the number of points
of intersection of the curves in the plot of energy equation. Furthermore, the eigenen-
ergies € shift to higher values as a decreases for both potentials. The scattering-state
wave functions and its asymptotic behavior near infinity for the two systems are also
obtained as precursors to analyzing scattering properties of the dipolar double and
quadrupolar triple Dirac-6 potentials.

Chapter 6

Conclusions and recommendations

Extensions to the application of space-fractional quantum mechanics (SFQM) to
studying other quantum systems are presented. Three quantum systems are consid-
ered, namely, multiple Dirac-6 wells with uniform strength, locally periodic potentials
such as Dirac-é and square barriers, and special cases of Dirac-¢ potentials with non-
uniform strengths such as the dipolar double and quadrupolar triple Dirac-d poten-
tials. In the analysis of each system, one of the two well-known methods, piecewise
and momentum space (Fourier transform), is used.

For the first system which consists of multiple Dirac-6 wells with uniform strength,
bound states are obtained using the momentum-space approach. Introducing an at-
tractive Dirac-comb potential to the space-fractional Schrodinger equation (SFSE),
it is shown that the problem of obtaining eigenenergies of a system with N Dirac-6
wells can be reduced to the problem of obtaining the eigenvalues of an N x N matrix.
To illustrate examples, this matrix formulation is applied to derive expressions sat-
isfied by the bound-state energies of N = 1,2,3 6-function wells. Known results for
single and double delta wells are recovered. The case of a triple Dirac-d well, which
is not yet explored in the literature, extends the application of the proposed matrix
method. In this configuration, it is found that at least three bound states can be
realized in the fractional regime (a = 1.6,1.8) and only two for the standard case
(a = 2.0). Plotting two of the three energy equations on the same grid, it is observed
that the difference between energies of the two states becomes smaller as the value
of the fractal order (Lévy index) « decreases. It is also expected that as « decreases
further, this energy difference vanishes. Obtaining bound states for higher numbers
of Dirac-6 wells is conceptually straightforward from the matrix eigenvalue equation
TC = A.C, which necessitates imposing the condition det(T — A,I) = 0 to get non-
trivial solutions. The corresponding bound-state wave functions are all expressed in
terms of Fox’s //-function.



The second systems are composed of locally periodic potentials such as a chain of
N Dirac-d barriers and a chain of N square barriers. Transmission and energy-band
structures are investigated in these systems. In the analysis the piecewise approach
is used. Transmission probabilities T(N) are calculated for a particle in a chain of
N’ Dirac-6 barriers and, for the other case, a chain of N square barriers. A transfer-
matrix approach in the context of SFQM is adapted to obtain equations for T(N).
Also, in the calculation, the jump condition for the fractional derivative of a wave
function is applied. It is observed that differences between the fractional (a = 1.8, 1.9)
and non-fractional (a = 2.0) regimes are apparent even for a small number of barriers
such as N = 2 and N = 1 for Dirac-é and square multibarrier systems, respectively,
and become even more pronounced as N increases. For both systems the transmission
coefficient curves are more rapidly oscillating in the fractional regime, giving more
transmission maximum and minimum points. The immediate emergence of bandlike
structures, which is a characteristic of periodic potentials, is also seen even for a
small number of barriers of as low as N = 4 and is much more obvious for lower
values of a. These band structures correspond to the allowed energies, separated by
valleys of forbidden energies which approach the value of T = 0 as N becomes larger.
As q@ decreases the number of allowed energy regions increases but become more
squeezed or closer to each other and essentially form a continuum. Albeit some of the
characteristics of energy band structures such as the width and number of allowed
energy regions in the fractional regime greatly vary from those of the standard one for
both multibarrier systems, the number of undulations on each hill of allowed energies
remains constant at N —1 in the multiple Dirac-d barriers. Fractional generalizations
of the limiting cases of square multibarrier systems for the case E < V(x) = Vo and
reduction of the results to those well-known in the standard quantum mechanics are
also presented.

Lastly, special types of Dirac-6 potentials with non-uniform strengths are consid-
ered. Specifically, the SFSE with a dipolar double Dirac-6 potential and the one with
a quadrupolar triple Dirac-6 potential are solved. The momentum-space approach is
used in the calculation, which is divided into two cases, namely, for / < 0 (bound
state) and E > 0 (scattering state). In analogy with the first system, bound-state
energy equations are obtained by applying the condition det(T —AqI) = 0. The wave
functions for both potentials are expressed in terms of Fox’s H-function. Graphical
method is used to determine the number of bound states. For the dipolar case one
unique solution is realized as dictated by the number of points of intersection of the
curves in the plot of energy equation. The corresponding wave function is found to
be antisymmetric, similar to the potential. Likewise, for the quadrupolar potential,
only one bound-state solution is found. Plot of the bound-state wave function reveals
some remarkable features which include symmetry of the wave function made by the
particular choice W = Z and the valley-like structure that becomes steeper with

5¢

respect to the symmetry axis as a decreases. For both potentials the eigenenergies
« shift to higher values as w decreases. Finally, the scattering-state wave function:
for the two systems are obtained. These serve as precursors to analyzing scattering
properties of the dipolar double and quadrupolar triple Dirac-6 potentials.

Some possible future work in the realm of SFQM is worth noting. In the quadrupo-
lar triple Dirac-6 potential only the case when the strength Vo > 0 is considered. For
Vo < 0, this constitutes a double delta well and a delta barrier. It is interesting tc
investigate how the number of bound states varies in this configuration. Recently
using the momentum-space approach it was found that obtaining transmission anc
reflection coefficients for particle in a single and a double d-function potential is pos-
sible in space-fractional quantum mechanics [38]. Investigating tunneling through ¢
triple Dirac-6 potential (such as the quadrupolar one considered here) is an obvious
extension. Also, the generalized form of the Dirac-6 well in the fractional-dimensiona
space, V(r) = —7d*(zx) (0 < X < 1, y > 0), which was first studied by Muslih [39]
can be extended to a problem of multiple generalized 6-function wells, and it is inter.
esting to see if the method proposed in Chapter 3 is still applicable. Also, theoreti-
cal efforts leading to experimental realization of space-fractional quantum mechanic:
(such as in a condensed-matter environment) are also of prime interest today afte:
Stickler [40] introduced the concept of a 1D Lévy crystal.
