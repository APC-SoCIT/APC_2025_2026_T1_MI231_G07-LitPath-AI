ABSTRACT

Wild relatives of rice are good sources of genes for abiotic and biotic stress tolerance and
resistance that were lost due to domestication. Development of molecular markers is
required in assisted selection of introgression lines and characterization of the donor plant
for the trait of interest. In this study, 94 insertion-deletion (InDel) markers were designed
and validated using PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis; further, Oryza granulata was
characterized during the seedling stage for its potential as donor of drought tolerance genes.
Results showed higher percentage of polymorphic markers (93.18%) between the AA and
GG Oryza genomes using InDel markers compared with only 25.93% polymorphic
markers using 96 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Comparison in the drought stress
responses between O. granulata and O. sativa did not show significant differences in
maximum root depth, root and shoot dry weights, root length density, percent lateral roots,
total root length, root to shoot ratio, tiller number, and plant height. Since the stomatal
density of O. granulata (317-378 stomata/mm²) is less than that of O. sativa (632
stomata/mm²), this trait can be tested in a drought set-up in future studies. Drought
response in terms of stomatal density, hard soil penetration, leaf greenness, and suberin
content of O. granulata may still be further studied. Overall, this study tells that designing
appropriate markers for screening and testing the potential of the target donor species as
source of the trait of interest are important especially in complicated traits like drought tolerance.

CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the second most planted cereal in the world and is the
staple food of more than half the world’s population, providing 40%-70% of each person’s
caloric intake (Yu et al. 2002; Bouman et al. 2007). It accounts for 86% of total cereal
production in Southeast Asia and 28% around the world (Jaffee et al. 2014). It highly
contributes to farmer livelihood, food security, and government revenue in several
countries in Asia and Africa (FAO 2004a; Wang et al. 2005; Konuma et al. 2014; Roy et

al. 2014).

As a product of domestication, rice has lost genes that are important in stress
tolerance and resistance, making them susceptible to pests, diseases, and abiotic stresses
(Kottapalli et al. 2010). Among these stresses is drought which accounts for 15%—50% loss
in yield, affecting the livelihood of thousands of farmers around the world (Kumar et al.
2008; Srividhya et al. 2011). Efforts in classical (Kumar et al. 2008) and transgenic
(Todaka et al. 2015) breeding have been done by researchers to transfer drought tolerance
traits to cultivated rice. These strategies require sources of genes for drought tolerance,

such as the wild relatives of rice (Yamaki et al. 2013).

The O. granulata complex is composed of two wild rice species, identified as
sources of genes for drought tolerance. This complex has the GG genome, which is the
farthest related genome to cultivated rice (Wambugu et al. 2013). Choosing this complex
as source of the desired trait is one way to effectively use and expand the pool of genetic

resources (Niihama et al. 2015). Although considered as different species, O. granulata


Nees & Arn. Ex. G. Watt and O. meyeriana (Zoll. & Moritzi) Baill. share the same genome
and have negligible reproductive barriers. They were even recommended to be placed into
the same species (Gong et al. 2000). To further explore this possibility, molecular markers
will be of great use. These markers are also applicable in assisting interspecific

hybridization between AA and GG genomes.

Microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been used in rice
marker-assisted breeding but have low applicability in wild rice species (Miah et al. 2013;
Yamaki et al. 2013). Thus, new markers must be developed to assess introgression of
important traits from wild rice to cultivated one. Wild rice sequence information is publicly
available in the form of Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC)-end sequences (BESs)
and can be utilized to design markers, such as insertion-deletion or InDels. InDel markers
are codominant markers that can easily be detected via polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
and gel electrophoresis. They are as practical as SSRs in terms of cost and precision but
are more frequent in the rice genome (Lu et al. 2015). InDels have been successfully used
in genetic and breeding in rice (Wu et al. 2013; Yonemaru et al. 2015). Twenty-two InDel
primers have been designed and validated by Yamaki et al. (2013) to discriminate among
the wild and cultivated species of rice, including O. granulata. However, additional
primers that are distributed in the whole genome are needed to differentiate between O.

sativa and O. granulata complex.

Root and shoot traits contribute to plant drought resistance (Polania et al. 2017;
Suralta et al. 2012; Suralta et al. 2018). In varying water regimes, plant shoots and roots

respond differently. To determine how the O. granulata complex responds to drought,


shoot and root traits are appropriate for observation in water-deficient and well-watered

soil.

In the present study, the general objective is to develop genome-wide InDel markers
to differentiate AA and GG genomes in rice and determine the potential of O. granulata as

donor of drought tolerance genes. Specifically, the study aims to do the following:

1. develop InDel primers to detect polymorphisms among O. sativa, O. granulata,
and O. meyeriana;

2. compare InDel markers to SSR markers; and

3. determine drought stress response of O. granulata and O. sativa by considering

root and shoot traits and stomatal density.

The study was conducted at the Novel Gene Resources laboratory and screenhouses
at the International Rice Research Institute, Philippines from August 2016 to November

2018.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

Oryza: Taxonomy and Phylogenetics

In 1753, Linnaeus gave the genus name Oryza and species name Oryza sativa to
rice, whereas O. glaberrima was given to the West African cultigen by Steudel in 1855
(Vaughan 1989). Before 1965, the number of species in the genus were about 30, but today,
Oryza includes 24 species comprising two cultivated and 22 wild species (Vaughan 1989;
Sanchez et al. 2014; Shakiba and Eizenga 2014). These species, which have been collected,
studied, and exchanged since AD 1012, are arranged in 10 different genome types: AA,
BB, CC, BBCC, CCDD, EE, FF, GG, HHJJ, and KKLL; five complexes: O. sativa, O.
officinalis, O. granulata, O. ridleyi, and O. schlechteria complex; and three sections:
Oryza, Padia, and Brachyantha (Table 1) (Vaughan 1994; Ammiraju et al. 2010; Sanchez
et al. 2014; Shakiba and Eizenga 2014). The two cultivated rice species, O. sativa, which
originated from tropical Asia, and O. glaberrima, which originated from West Africa, have
AA genomes and belong to O. sativa complex and section Oryza (FAO 2004b; Shakiba
and Eizenga, 2014). These two cultigens and other members of the O. sativa complex
prefer full sun, grow near lakes, rivers and seasonal pools of water (Shakiba and Eizenga

2014).

The members of Oryza have distinguishable variation in spikelet structure, which
contains the fruit and caryopsis, and thus, it is one of the key characters for morphological

rice classification (Fig. 1) (Vaughan 1989). Other morphological characteristics used for

rice classification are attachment of spikelets to pedicel, lemma structure, presence of
sterile lemmas, and type of embryo (Launert 1965; Tateoka 1964). In 1994, almost all the
species known today and their genome types were identified, except for the species O.
coarcta and the genome types of O. granulata, O. schlechteri, and O. ridleyi complexes,
which were discovered in 1997 (Vaughan 1994; Aggarwal et al. 1997). The bases of
classifications used were morphology, cytogenetics for genome relationship analysis,
isozyme analyses, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), intergenic spacer
(ITS) variation, SSR analysis, and chloroplast genes analysis (Vaughan 1994; OECD
1999). Figure 2 shows morphological diversity of genome type representatives of wild rice

sourced from Ammiraju et al. (2010).

Figure 2. Morphological diversity of representative species for each genome type of Oryza
(Ammiraju et al. 2010).

Several methods have been applied to study the genetic variation and relationship
present in the species of the Oryza genus, such as inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR)
polymorphism analysis (Joshi et al. 2000), genome-specific DNA probing (McIntyre and
Winberg 1998), RFLP analysis (Ge et al. 2001), and random amplified polymorphic DNA
(RAPD) analysis (Martin et al. 1997), but the results varied due to different targets in the
rice genome. With the finished O. sativa genome sequencing in 2002 (Buell 2002a; Buell
2002b; Goff et al. 2002; Yu et al. 2002; Vaughan et al. 2003) and the construction of BAC
library of Oryza wild species (Wing et al. 2005; Ammiraju et al. 2006; Ammiraju et al.

2010), more accurate phylogenetic analyses were conducted.

The year 2005 saw the launching of the Oryza Map Alignment Project (OMAP)
which aimed to construct and align BAC-based physical maps of representative species for

each genome type of Oryza to the reference genome sequence of O. sativa ssp. japonica


c.v. Nipponbare generated by the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP)
(Wing et al. 2005; Ammiraju et al. 2006). In 2006, the same group published the
completion of the BAC library construction with genome sequences of some of the wild
species, such as O. nivara, O. rufipogon, O. glaberrima, O. barthii, O. longistaminata, O.
punctata, and O. brachyantha (Ammiraju et al. 2006; Sanchez et al. 2014). The BAC-end
sequences were predominantly used for the discernment of the relationships between the
species of Oryza (Fig. 3). The distribution, abundance, and role of transposable elements
in the evolution of rice species were the focus of some of these studies (Zuccolo et al. 2007;
Roulin et al. 2008; Gill et al. 2010). In 2013, Zou et al. utilized several nuclear genes
representing all the 12 chromosomes of diploid wild species of rice to predict the
divergence times of lineages in Oryza. They estimated that Oryza originated 13 to 15
million years ago (MYA) during middle Miocene and obtained two diversifications: first
diversification involved F-/G-genomes and H-/J-/K-genomes within <1 Myr after Oryza
originated; second diversification gave rise to A-/B-/C-genomes 5-6 MYA. In 2018, 13

wild and domesticated species were fully sequenced (Stein et al. 2018).

al. 2010; Sanchez et al. 2014).
---: origin of tetraploids, @: maternal parents, O: unidentified diploid species.

The identification of genes controlling useful traits in wild rice species has also
been obtained through interspecific or intergenomic hybridization and development of
mapping populations. These mapping populations may be composed of recombinant inbred
lines (RIL), advanced backcross (AB), backcross inbred lines (BIL), chromosome segment
substitution lines (CSSL), near isogenic lines (NIL), multi-parent advanced generation
inter-cross (MAGIC), or monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) (Shakiba and Eizenga

2014).


O. sativa L. (2n= 24) is a rice cultigen species, which originated from tropical Asia

(FAO 2004a; Zeilang and Pattanayak 2013). Its production involves three general stages,
namely, pre-planting, growth, and post-production (IRRI n.d.). Included in these stages are
12 steps for successful rice production, which comprise usage of crop calendar, choosing
the best variety and best quality seeds, preparation of fields, planting on time, weeding
early, usage of fertilizer, water efficiency, harvesting on time, storage, efficient milling,
and understanding the market. Crop calendars are used for better planning of farm activities
and efficient costing, because they include the best date to plant, growth duration of
varieties from planting to harvest, dates for plowing, weeding, fertilizing, and harvesting,
and the needed labor and equipment for each activity (IRRI n.d.). Figure 4 shows growth
duration diagrams from IRRI featuring direct seeded and transplanted rice, which can be

used for creating crop calendars.

The selection of the best rice variety, which is suitable to the farmer’s growing
conditions, is important for cost-efficient rice farming. The farming conditions that need
consideration are water availability from rain or irrigation, soil type, and field elevation,
whereas crop duration, crop height, and grain quality are needed in selecting the best
variety. Seeds are also checked for cleanliness, pureness, and health. IRRI indicated that
good seed is free from stones, soil, or weed seeds, contains only grains from one variety,
big, of the same color, and no cracks or spotting. Float test is often used in checking for
seed viability, whereas moisture content (<12-14%) is used to evaluate vigor and life of

the seed (IRRI n.d.).

Besides being an important crop for food security, rice also serves as a model
system for the grass family (Ammiraju et al. 2010). In 2002, full draft sequences of O.

sativa L., which are independent efforts of Beijing Institute of Genomics, IRGSP,

Syngenta, and Monsanto, were already available (Buell 2002a; Buell 2002b; Goff et al.
2002; Yu et al. 2002; Vaughan et al. 2003; Yu et al. 2005). These sequences are used as
references for bioinformatics. In 2005, the Beijing Institute of Genomics group described
an improved reference genome for rice by integrating their data with those from IRSGP
and Syngenta; it described the less but comparable data quality from whole genome
shotgun (WGS) method than clone-by-clone method and demonstrated the large role of
gene duplications in the evolution of rice (Yu et al. 2005). In 2013, Kawahara et al. updated
the Nipponbare reference genome through the improvement of the genome assembly by
revising the minimum tiling path of clones using optical map and identifying sequence

error by resequencing (Kawahara et al. 2013).

With the availability of rice reference sequences, next generation sequencing
(NGS) and microarrays are the most preferred method for genotyping different varieties
and species of rice (Yu et al. 2014), although some may still use PCR (Hirotsu et al. 2010).
Rice6K, a whole genome SNP array, utilizes the Illumina Infinium technology for high
throughput genotyping, germplasm fingerprinting, and background selection in rice (Yu et
al. 2014). This platform is already being used in several laboratories, including those in

IRRI.

Rice Improvement Through Interspecific Hybridization

Rice production is expected to decline by 2050, and the world is facing a higher
demand for rice due to population growth (Abdullah et al. 2005; Sharma 2014).

Intensifying the problem is the continuous decrease in paddy area, brought about by

urbanization and climate change (Chen 2007; Okamoto et al. 2014; Hao et al. 2015).
Affirmatively, the growing number of studies for high quality rice is thought to have an

impact on these projections (Shakiba and Eizenga 2014; Sharma 2014).

The main goal of rice breeding is to increase food production by improving the
grain yield potential, grain quality, resistance to pests and diseases, and tolerance to abiotic
stresses (Gowda et al. 2003; Guimaraes 2009). Table 2 presents some agronomically

important traits which are present in rice (Gowda et al. 2003).

In 2003, nearly 450 genes affecting rice morphology, physiology, biochemistry,
and biotic and abiotic stress response have been identified in rice (Gowda et al. 2003).
These discoveries involved genes that code for or control morphological traits, such as,
anthocyanin pigmentation, hull and pericarp color, spikelet traits, grain size and shape,
endosperm traits, panicle traits, photosensitivity, hybrid sterility, male sterility, fertility
restoration, wide compatibility, and chlorophyll deficiency. Abiotic resistance genes
against bacterial blight, blast, Cercospora, stripe viruses, grassy stunt virus, hojablanca,
yellow dwarf virus, plant hopper, green leafhopper, zigzag leafhopper, whitebacked plant
hopper, and gall midge, were also included (Gowda et al. 2003). Interspecific hybridization
in rice is done to introduce useful abiotic and biotic stress tolerance/resistance genes and
genes for yield improvement from wild Oryza species to popular O. sativa L. varieties
(Khan et al. 2015). Through backcross breeding, researchers are able to produce MAALs,
which contain complete sets of chromosomes from the recurrent parent and an additional
chromosome from the donor parent (Yasui et al. 1997). A set of MAALs with all 12
chromosomes passed on as extras into backcross lines is useful in mapping genes, which

can be associated with resistance/tolerance traits, in wild rice chromosomes (Hossain et al.

et al. 2003).

Higher yield in a wider soil and climatic zones


2012). From these MAALs, disomics, which are diploid lines containing 24 chromosomes
introgressed with small segments of DNA from the wild rice donor, may be produced
through backcrossing (Angeles-Shim et al. 2014). In 2014, Sanchez et al. listed cases of
introgression of abiotic/biotic stress resistance/tolerance genes from different wild Oryza
species into rice. Many of the genes controlling the traits are not yet identified.
Nevertheless, many varieties with useful traits from wild Oryza developed through wide
hybridization and marker-assisted selection (MAS) have already been released. These
varieties carry the genes for grassy stunt resistance, BPH resistance, acid sulfate tolerance,
salinity tolerance, tungro resistance, BB resistance, blast resistance, high yield, weed

competitive ability, and heat tolerance (Sanchez et al. 2014).

O. granulata Complex

The O. granulata complex is composed of two species, namely, O. granulata and
O. meyeriana. Both species have the GG genome and identified to be drought tolerant,
shade tolerant, and bacterial blight resistant. O. granulata and O. meyeriana are considered
as different species, but they share the same genome, have negligible reproductive barriers

and were recommended to be placed into the same species (Gong et al. 2000).

O. meyeriana and O. granulata are drought and shade tolerant wild species of rice,
with resistance to bacterial blight and adaptation to aerobic soil (Duncan 1994; Gao et al.

2000). They are the most basal and farthest related species to cultivated rice in the Oryza

genus and have diploid GG genomes (Fu et al. 2008; Wambugu et al. 2013). They are also

insensitive to photoperiodism (Vaughan 1989; Vaughan 1994; Fu et al. 2008).

O. granulata is widely distributed in South and Southeast Asia, and thrives in forest
floors of full shade (Gao et al. 2000). It is a short (usually <1 m) herb, with lanceolate dark
green leaves, and awnless spikelets (<6.4 mm) with granulate texture of palea and lemma.
O. granulata is distinguished from O. meyeriana mainly by the length of the spikelet. It
was observed to be flowering all year long, with peaks in July and August (Vaughan 1994;
Gao et al. 1996). It was also found to be a colonizing plant, which populates hectares of
space through clonal propagation and exhibits seed dormancy (Gao et al. 2000).
Accordingly, they have high genetic diversity among populations and low genetic diversity
within populations in Yunnan, China (Qian et al. 2001; Gao et al. 2000; Wu et al. 2004).
Figure 5 shows the O. granulata plant, spikelet structure, distribution, and habitat. Hybrids
and advanced progenies of O. sativa and O. granulata were produced in 1991, but all lines
showed negative results for the introgression of O. granulata traits to cultivated rice (Brar

et al. 1991; Sanchez et al. 2014).

O. granulata has no existing expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the National Center

for Biotechnology information (NCBI) database, but BESs are available in the Rice
Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB) (rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/) (Ammiraju et al. 2006;
Ammiraju et al. 2010). In 2018, its genome was sequenced to study its expansion and
evolution (Wu et al. 2018). These BAC-end sequences have enough information for

molecular marker design.

Insertion-Deletion Markers

Molecular markers speed up the breeding process by serving as landmarks in the
genome that can be associated with a trait and detected during the early stages of a plant.
Several markers may be used, including isozymes and DNA markers. SSR or microsatellite
markers are commonly used because of their relative abundance in genomes, high
polymorphism, codominance, wide distribution throughout the genome, and inexpensive
requirements (Miah et al. 2013). However, they have limited genome abundance and
coverage (Liu et al. 2013). SSRs have been extensively used in rice, and to complement
the limitation of these markers, other markers are used in association studies to cover the

whole genome.

Insertion-deletion (InDel) markers are cheap and easy to use and can be mined from
Next Generation Sequencing data (Vali et al. 2008). They are codominant markers that can
easily be detected via PCR and gel electrophoresis and are as practical as SSRs but are

more frequent in the rice genome (Lu et al. 2015). They have been used in plant breeding

and in identifying various traits in rice and other plants (Pacurar et al. 2012; Markkandan
et al. 2018). In 2012, 229 InDel markers were developed to distinguish between two
accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. These markers were used to map 35 mutations in a
hybrid of the tested accessions (Pacurar et al. 2012). Using the reference sequences of
Hedou 12 and Williams 82 soybean accessions, Song et al. (2015) developed 243 candidate
InDel markers, which were validated and tested among 14 soybean cultivars and were used
in mapping CRINKLY LEAF gene in chromosome 7. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs)
underlying flowering time in soybean were also identified using InDel markers (Wang et
al. 2018). Recently, Jain et al. (2019) generated and validated a total of 8307 InDels through
Dindel software using genome sequences of intraspecific and interspecific hybrids of
chickpea. InDels have also been used along with SNPs in identifying genes for pathogen
resistance in potato (Rickert et al. 2003). Organellar genome can be a source of InDels too
as shown in the study by Cho et al. (2017), who developed five InDel markers from the
chloroplast genome of tartary and common buckwheat and tested them in identifying traces

of the two species in processed foods.

In rice, InDel markers were developed to distinguish between two rice cultivars
Nipponbare and 9311 (Liu et al. 2015) and between indica and japonica landraces (Zeng
et al. 2013; Sahu et al. 2017). These markers were also applied by Steele et al. (2007) to
distinguish Basmatis from other fragrant rice varieties. They designed 47 InDel markers,
in which 71% showed polymorphisms between Basmati and non-Basmati rice varieties. In
2015, Yonemaru et al. developed two sets of InDel markers for breeding of Japanese rice

cultivars from elite line Koshihikari. InDel markers have also been used in the

determination of genetic diversity of rice landraces in Chhattisgarh, India (Sahu et al. 2017)

and in marker-assisted introgression of rice blast resistance gene in rice (Hua et al. 2014).

InDel markers can be mined between wild and cultivated rice genomes rice
characterization and improvement. In 2013, 22 InDel primers have been designed and
validated by Yamaki et al. to discriminate among the wild and cultivated species of rice.
In 2014, Angeles-Shim et al. used InDel markers together with SSR markers and single
nucleotide polymorphisms to identify introgression segments from O. latifolia to O. sativa.
Niihama et al. (2015) designed InDels for breeding chromosome segment substitution lines
(CSSLs) between O. sativa, japonica cultivars and wild Oryza species, which include O.
rufipogon, O. barthii, O. glumaepatula, O. meridionalis, and O. longistaminata. InDel
markers were also used in assisted introgression of salt tolerance genes from O. rufipogon
line Dongxiang to rice (Quan et al. 2017) and in characterization of genetic structure of O.

rufipogon populations in China (Jin et al. 2018).


Drought Stress Response in Rice

Water is vital in plant growth. Apart from being an important substrate in
photosynthesis, it also regulates plant temperature and turgor pressure in vascular tissues,
aids the entry of carbon dioxide, and distributes minerals to the different parts of the plant
(Chavarria and dos Santos 2012). Because of its large role in plant development, it is a

limiting factor in crop production (Soren et al. 2010; Shamsi and Kobraee 2011).

Drought stress has been the focus of several crop researches, especially on rice and
wheat (Babu 2010; Soren et al. 2010; Khakwani et al. 2011). It greatly affects crop yield,
especially in tropical countries where most crops are grown (Babu 2010; Li et al. 2011). In
rice, several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified to be potentially linked to
drought tolerance and some were introgressed to popular varieties (Steele et al. 2006; Babu
2010). However, most of these loci have not been fine-mapped and cannot be used in MAS
yet (Babu 2010). Continuous mining for sources of drought tolerance genes from other
germplasm, especially the wild species of rice, is currently being done in different research

facilities (Neelam et al. 2018; Donde et al. 2017).

Drought-adapted plants thrive in arid conditions by three ways: escape, avoidance,
and tolerance (Leonardis et al. 2012). Different plants, including O. sativa, manifest these
drought responses (Sack et al. 2003; Babu 2010; Soren et al. 2010). Table 3 presents
different physiological responses exhibited by plants to escape, avoid, or tolerate drought.
In the past years, some of the genes involved in these responses have been identified and

may be used as target genes when screening for drought tolerant lines.

The reproductive stage of a crop, especially pollen formation, is highly affected by

water loss or deficit (Babu 2010). To escape drought, plants undergo a short life cycle or
developmental plasticity (Leonardis et al. 2012). Here, the plant completes its life cycle
during periods with sufficient water before the onset of drought. Using the phenology of
the plant, the breeder may know the most suitable time to plant the crop in order to avoid
the onset of drought (Warren and Barnett 2014). However, tropical countries, especially
the Philippines, have unpredictable rainy and sunny seasons, brought about by climate
change (Dulce et al. 2012). Consequently, phenological calendars cannot be used all the

time.

Drought avoidance is another mechanism by which plants survive in arid
conditions. It involves enhanced water uptake and reduced water loss (Leonardis et al.
2012). By this definition, drought avoidance involves morphological adaptations of the

roots and leaves.

Photosynthesis results to the production of glucose and oxygen by reacting carbon
dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) through the light energy from the sun (Krishnan 2011).
About 90% of the water uptake by the roots are transpired or lost into the atmosphere
through the stomata. The stomata have to be opened in order for CO> to enter the plant cell.
In other words, transpiration is needed for photosynthesis to proceed. Also, plants need to
transpire in order to regulate plant temperature and turgor pressure in vascular tissues and
distribute minerals to the different parts of the plant (Chavarria and dos Santos 2012).
During hot dry days, plants lose more water than in humid conditions. Therefore, water

deficit is detrimental to the crop’s yield and life. To overcome this, some plants have


evolved to close their stomata, roll their leaves, increase leaf glaucousness, and undergo

senescence of older leaves, or reduce their leaf area (Leonardis et al. 2012).

Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis is a way plants reduce water
loss and increase yield in plants, because this process happen during the day, with the
stomata partially or completely closed (Males and Griffith 2017). C4 plants utilize CO2
more efficiently than C3 plants at high light intensity because CO? is directly delivered to
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) (Rizal et al. 2012). CAM
plants, on the other hand, open their stomata at night and closes them at daytime. CO2 is
stored in acid form, which is broken down during the day and delivered to RuBisCO
(Cushman and Bohnert 1999). CAM plants are mostly desert plants, some of which also
have reduced or lost their leaves and have succulent bodies in order to reduce water loss

and store water, respectively. They also never use photorespiration.

Root morphology is also important in drought avoidance. Some plants exhibit root
elongation to deeper soil in order to reach available water (Hodge et al. 2009; Cattivelli et
al. 2008) while some plants have suberin, which prevent water loss in the roots to avoid
cell death in the area (Meyer and Peterson 2013). The expansin gene in soybean was
correlated with root elongation (Lee et al. 2003). In rice, several QTLs associated with root
development have been detected. Among these QTLs are phosphorus uptake 1 (PUP 1),
which contributes to phosphorus (P) uptake in low P content soils, and deeper rooting]
(DRO1). PUP! is actually a gene termed phosphorus starvation tolerance (PSTOL1),
which was discovered as a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (Gamuyao et al. 2012),
whereas DRO] encodes an unknown protein that is associated with plasmalemma. DRO!

is regulated by auxin response factor (ARF).


Suberin is a fatty acid that is highly expressed in the roots of some plants during
drought stress (Meyer and Peterson 2013). When suberin layers get thick, water cannot go
out of the roots, preventing the root cells from desiccation (Pollard et al. 2008). Genes
CYP86A33, a fatty acid oxidase, and STKCS6, a gene responsible for cutin biosynthesis,
greatly affect the production of suberin (Figueras 2006). Drought tolerance involves
osmoregulation, osmotic adjustment, and stomata regulation. In a recent review by Soren
et al. (2010), several genetic engineering techniques that aim to improve drought tolerance
in rice were described. Drought stress affects plant metabolism and results to upregulation
and down-regulation of certain genes. It could follow three different response pathways,
namely, abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent, ABA-independent, and WRKY pathways. This
regulation of gene expression involves changes in membrane integrity and modulation of
lipid biosynthesis. The accumulation of compatible solutes that causes decreased water
potential inside the cell and forcing water to be pulled inside also happen. Further, H*-
ATPase and Ca”*-ATPase activities change, triggering change in Ca”* influx, cytoplasmic

pH and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Soren 2010).

Some solutes that contribute to drought tolerance are glycine-betaine, mannitol,
raffinose, galactiomol, fructans, trehalose, and proline (Soren et al. 2010). Their production
is controlled by different genes. For instance, glycine-betaine is produced by oxidizing
betainealdehyde by betainealdehyde dehydrogenase (BADH). Betainaldehyde is a product
of choline oxidation by choline oxidase (COX). COX and BADH can be found in the

stroma and are induced by stress.

During stress, the levels of control include expression of transcription factors,

mRNA splicing, epigenetic regulation, and mRNA translation. The transcription factors

that are regulated during stress are of the bZIP, MYB, MYC, ERF, and WRKY families.
The bZIP family depends on ABA and respond to transcriptional and post-transcriptional
level during drought stress. MYC and MYB act as positive regulators once endogenous
ABA has accumulated. Ethylene responsive factors (ERFs) function in both ABA-
dependent and independent pathways, are ethylene responsive, and involved in the
expression of dehydration and low-temperature-responsive genes. Lastly, WRKY are
transcription factors involved in the development, response to stress, and hormone-

requiring mechanisms of a plant (Sahoo et al. 2013).

In a study by Islam et al. (2018), seedling stage drought tolerance was highlighted
to be critical in seed germination, seed establishment, and seedling development. Among
the mentioned effects of drought to rice in the seedling stage are inhibition of cell
enlargement, impaired seed germination, lower seedling height, reduced biomass

production, and lower tiller number.

Another mechanism that may be involved in rice drought response involves the
stomata. In 2018, Caine et al. discovered that fewer stomata in rice leaves contributes in
drought tolerance by requiring less water to survive and having enough water to cool itself
in arid conditions. Additionally, low stomatal count was also associated with low stomatal
conductance, which is related to photosynthesis (Ouyang et al. 2017). In the same study,
smaller stomata were associated with strong drought response. No literature is available on

the study of stomatal density and size in wild rice species at the time of the present study.

CHAPTER 3

MATERIALS AND METHODS

InDel Marker Design and Screening

Sequence retrieval and InDel marker design

BAC-end sequences (BESs) of O. granulata and homologous O. sativa sequences
were retrieved from Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB) (Sakai et al. 2013). The
BESs were aligned against the reference genome sequence of rice (O. sativa spp. japonica
cv. Nipponbare) in MSU-RGAP release 7 — genomic sequences using BLASTn on Rice
Genome Annotation Project

(http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/analyses_search_blast.shtml) website without changing

the default parameters (expect threshold = 1e-5; max number of alignments reported = 10;
word length = 11; filter = none), and gaps of more than 18 bp were searched every three
megabases. These gaps represent insertions or deletions in either of the two aligned species.
Primers were designed around these InDels using AmplifX ver. 1.7.0 (http://en.bio-
soft.net/pcr/AmplifX.html) (Jullien 2004). The difference in the expected product size
between the two parentals was determined by performing in silico PCR using the same
software. Gap sizes of 10% to 20% of the product size were selected for easy detection of
band size difference using agarose gel electrophoresis as done by Yamaki et al. (2013).
The primers were then ordered from Macrogen, Korea. This protocol was derived from
previous studies (Lang et al. 2010; Melloul et al. 2014; Pang et al. 2014; Scascitelli et al.

2010).


Plant materials
O. sativa ssp. indica cv. IR64 (AA), O. sativa ssp. indica cv. IRRI 154 (NSIC Re
222) (AA), O. granulata (IRGC 102118) (GG), O. granulata (IRGC 106474) (GG), O.
meyeriana (IRGC 89241) (GG), and O. meyeriana (IRGC 89243) (GG) were used as plant

materials in primer testing.

Plant sampling and DNA extraction

Total genomic DNA was extracted from leaf tissues of plant samples using TPE
(100 mM Tris-HCI pH 9.5, 1 M KCI, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0) Buffer based on the simple
DNA preparation protocol (Kim et al. 2016), as follows: (1) 2-cm young leaf was sampled
from the plant of interest; (2) the leaf was frozen using liquid nitrogen and ground using
GenoGrinder for 8 minutes; (3) 400 pL TPE buffer was added, and the solution was shaken
and kept at 65 °C for 30 min; (4) the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15
minutes; (4) 20 wL of the supernatant was aliquoted and diluted with 130 4L nanopure
water and was directly used for PCR. Crude DNA solution was stored in -20 °C until PCR

amplification.

PCR amplification and AGE
PCR reactions were performed using a final volume of 20 1 with the following
components: 2 1 L crude genomic DNA, | unit Tag DNA polymerase, 1X PCR buffer, 0.25

mM dNTPs, and 0.25 mM of each primer. The PCR program was done as follows: 2.5 min

at 95 °C, 35 cycles (25 s at 95 °C, 25 s at 55 °C, and 50 s at 72 °C), and 5 min at 72 °C.
The primers used in the PCR reactions are listed in Appendices A and B.

The amplified fragments were resolved via electrophoresis runs on 3.5% agarose
gels. The images were captured using a gel imager. Polymorphic bands between the plants

can be used to detect introgression from one species to the other.

Band Scoring

The gels were scored according to the presence of the expected band sizes. The
following scores were assigned to each marker: 0 — monomorphic between AA and GG
genomes; | - polymorphic between AA and GG genomes; 2 — polymorphic between O.
meyeriana and O. granulata, 3 — polymorphic between O. sativa accessions; 4
polymorphic between O. granulata accessions; 5 — absent bands in either genomes; 6 no
PCR products among all samples; and 7 — polymorphic between AA and GG genomes, but
bands other than the expected sizes are present. The percentage of the amplified and
polymorphic markers were computed for the InDel and SSR markers. The polymorphic
markers were plotted against rice chromosomes’ using PhenoGram
(http://visualization.ritchielab.org/phenograms/) based on Proximity Algorithm (Ritchie

Lab 2012).


Drought Stress Screening

Plant Materials

Oryza sativa ssp. indica cv. IR64 and O. granulata 102118 were used as plant
materials in the drought study. The seeds and leaf samples were obtained from Novel Gene
Resources Laboratory with the approval of Dr. Kshirod K. Jena and Dr. Sung-Ryul Kim.
In the drought test, seed dormancy was broken before germination by placing seeds at 40
°C to 42 °C for two days. O. sativa seeds were pregerminated for two days on a petri dish
at 28 °C, whereas O. granulata was germinated in MS media (after not germinating on a
petri dish on the first try). For the seedlings to have approximately the same ages, O. sativa
was germinated later than the O. granulata plants. The clones were tillers from an existing

plant.

The species tested for stomatal density included O. sativa, O. glaberrima, O.
rufipogon, O. longistaminata, O. punctata, O. officinalis, O. minuta, O. latifolia, O. alta,

O. australiensis, O. brachyantha, O. granulata, O. ridleyi, and O. coarctata (Table 4).

Physiological set-up

Two-day old seedlings were planted on sterilized and fertilized soil placed in mylar
tubes. These tubes are long and slender to allow measurement and comparison of root
length. The mylar tubes were placed inside PVC tubes, which were arranged randomly on

a case with 5x7 slots (63.5 cm x 88.9 cm). The set-up is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Diagram of a mylar tube and PVC tube used to test the drought response of Oryza
granulata Nees & Arn. Ex. G. Watt and O. sativa L.

At the beginning of the experiment, mylar tubes were assembled using mylar plastic
sheets, which were cut into 45 cm x 8 cm and joined end-to-end using duct tape. The
bottom of the tube was covered with fabric to allow passing through of water from the tube.
Dried, sieved, and sterilized upland soil was weighed and placed into each tube up to 40
cm height. The mylar tubes were placed inside PVC tubes, which were epoxy-sealed at the
bottom, painted white, and checked for leaks at the beginning of the experiment. The

weight of the PVC tubes together with the mylar tube and dry soil were determined.


Two treatments, namely, well-watered (WW) and drought (DD), were set-up. The
WW treatment was maintained at field capacity, whereas the DD treatment was dried down
from 75% of the field capacity throughout the experiment. To determine the field capacity
of the soil, soil-filled mylar tubes were saturated with water by adding water at the top and
soaking the bottom of the tube for two hours, and then, water was allowed to drain from
the bottom of the tube. The remaining water was determined as the field capacity. Seventy -
five percent of the field capacity was computed and placed in the DD tubes. The tubes were
arranged in a case with 5x7 slots using a randomized complete block design.

Five replicates per genotype were set-up for the experiment. The genotypes tested
were O. sativa L., O. granulata cloned from an existing plant, and O. granulata from seed.
Each tube was barcode-labeled. The germinated seeds and clones were sowed in a
screenhouse and were kept moist until established. The pots were weighed every two days,
with watering of the WW plants to maintain field capacity and drying down of the DD
plants. The plants were harvested after 21 days.

During harvesting, the maximum root depth and plant height were first measured.
Then, the shoots were placed inside envelopes and placed inside the oven to determine the
dry weight. Before being dried in the oven, the roots were placed in 25% ethanol solution
(v/v) and was scanned and analyzed using WinRhizo to determine the total length and
lateral length of the roots. Once measured, the roots were placed inside the oven and
weighed to obtain dry weight.

ANOVA was performed using the Statistical Tool for Agricultural Research (STAR)

package. Graphs with error bars were created using Microsoft Excel.

Screenhouse temperature and relative humidity were measured using Hobo™ to

determine if the environment is the factor affecting plant response.

Stomatal Density

The flag leaves of mature wild rice plants were obtained from the screenhouse,
measured for leaf length and width, soaked in water, and put in 4 °C until scratching. The
middle part of the flag leaves was scratched using blades until only one layer of cells at the
abaxial side was left. The leaves were viewed under 10X magnification using a light
microscope (Olympus BX61) under bright field, and five replicates were included for
counting. The stomata included inside the field of view were counted, and stomatal density
was computed using Eqn. 1. Five fields of view per species were sampled, and stomata
were counted using the cell counter function in Image J software (Arena et al., 2016). To
normalize the data, a field of view correction factor (CF) of 359 was used. The CF is the

area (mm?) of the field of view computed from x:692.23 * y:518.59/1000

(Eqn. 1) Stomatal Density = Stomatal count (no./field of view) x 1000
CF

Pearson’s Correlation coefficients were computed between leaf length and width, leaf
length and stomatal density, and leaf width and stomatal density. Scatter plots were

generated to show the relationships among these factors.

CHAPTER 4

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Development of Polymorphic InDel Markers and Comparison with SSR Markers

To assist breeding programs, molecular markers are essential to track the exchange
of genomic sequences among crossed lines. Using O. granulata BAC-end sequences from
RAPDB (https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/), many insertions and deletions (InDels) were found
by aligning these BESs with the Nipponbare genome using BLAST in MSU-TIGR
(http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/analyses_search_blast.shtml). Gaps that are not
necessarily continuous and can come from either genome were searched in every three
megabases in the Nipponbare genome. Some BESs contain sparse number of InDels, and
thus searching the subsequent BESs was done until InDels with the correct size and have
flanking sequences from which primers can be designed were found. When the following
criteria were set in AmplifX ver. 1.7.0 software (http://en.bio-soft.net/per/AmplifX.html)
in designing a useful primer, namely >50 °C melting temperature, > GC percent, 3' end
stability, no polyX, and no self-dimer and self-end dimer formation, 121 InDel primer pairs
were designed. A total of 94 InDel primers with product size difference of more than 20%
of the product sizes were finally selected for synthesis and testing. Manual mining of
InDels and designing of the primers were tedious and took a substantial amount of time in

the research process.

A total of 94 InDel markers and 96 SSR markers were tested for polymorphism

between the AA and GG genomes (Tables 5 and 6). The InDel sizes ranged from 16 bp to

61 bp (Table 7). Among 94 InDel primers tested, 88 (93.62%) primers amplified, and 82
(93.18%) primers are polymorphic between AA and GG genomes (Table 7 and Fig. 7).
These polymorphic primers can therefore be used to determine interspecific hybrids
between O. sativa and O. granulata or O. meyeriana. Notably, 9.09% or eight markers,
namely, GG06_001, GG11_004, GG12_004, GG02_007, GG03_005, GG06_007,
GG09_005, and GG09_006 were polymorphic between O. granulata and O. meyeriana.
These markers can be used in distinguishing between the two species with the GG genome
and can be applied in diversity studies in the O. meyeriana complex. In addition, 4.55% or
four markers, namely GG05_001, GG11_04, GG02_007, and GG09_006 were also found
to be polymorphic between the two accessions of O. sativa, and none of the markers were
polymorphic between the two accessions of O. meyeriana and those of O. granulata (Table
7). Lastly, 1.06% or one marker (GG08_006) was found to amplify in all the tested
accessions but is monomorphic among the samples. The rest of the markers were found to
amplify only in one genome but had no PCR products in the other genome. These markers
were not considered for recommendation for use in genotyping. Table 8 presents

representative gel images of the two kinds of markers and the corresponding gel scores.

Figure 7 shows the chromosome map with location of the polymorphic InDel
markers. Chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 have large regions that are not represented
by markers. These unrepresented regions can be covered by using other markers such as
SSRs and SNPs in addition to InDels in marker-assisted screening of plants. In summary,
eight markers were designed for chromosome 1, seven for chromosome 2, 11 for
chromosome 3, eight for chromosome 4, six for chromosome 5, six for chromosome 6,

three for chromosome 7, seven for chromosome 8, five for chromosome 9, four for InDels

are relatively most abundant and regularly distributed in chromosomes 3 and 12 and is least

abundant in chromosome 7.

To highlight the advantage of InDel markers, SSR markers were also tested for
amplification in the six Oryza accessions (Table 8). Results showed that only 28.12% or
27 primers out of 96 were able to amplify the tested samples (Tables 6 and 7). More
importantly, 25.93% markers (7/27), namely RM5753, RM3769, RM7217, RM4069,
RM2197, RM7448, and RM8216 were found to be polymorphic among the AA and GG
genomes. Only two markers (7.41%), namely, RM5753 and RM5607 were polymorphic
between O. meyeriana and O. granulata. Also, two markers (7.41%) were polymorphic
between the two accessions of O. sativa; these were RM5753 and RM3320. None of the
markers were polymorphic between the accessions of O. meyeriana and those of O.
granulata, whereas the three markers, namely, RM6024, RM3123, and RM5373 were
found to be monomorphic (3.12%) among the two genomes. Sixteen markers (16.67%)

were able to amplify in the AA genome only.

With the growing sophistication of New Generation Sequencing technologies, the
genomic sequences of the species of choice can be obtained, and markers that are based on
this information can be designed with more accuracy. The designed InDel markers in this
study were proven to have higher success rates in amplification and detection of
polymorphism between AA and GG genomes (93.62% and 93.18%, respectively)
compared with rice SSR markers (28.12% and 25.92%, respectively). These markers are
cost-efficient but requires time and intensive labor in designing. Manual designing of these
markers was performed in this study because automated pipelines, such as InDel Markers

Development Platform or IMDP, require sophisticated technical and computational

requirements (Lu et al. 2015). Nevertheless, the software and parameters in AmplifX 2.0
used in designing the InDel primer pairs in the present study were shown to be optimal.
Modifications in the PCR protocol, such as adjustment of the annealing temperature and

extension time, can still be applied and optimized for multiplex screening.

The low amplification and polymorphism rates obtained in the SSR markers were
mainly because these SSR markers were not specifically designed to differentiate between
the AA and GG genomes, whereas the InDel primers were designed directly from
differences between the sequences of the two genomes. The obtained rates of success are
quite expected. Low rate of polymorphism was also observed in a cross-transferability

study of SSR markers to O. granulata (Gao et al. 2005).

Some chromosomes, such as chromosomes 6 and 10, have smaller number of
designed, amplified, and polymorphic InDel markers than the rest. Other markers, such as
SNPs and gene-specific markers, or genotyping-by-sequencing can be added in genotyping
to compensate for the low number of InDel markers in these chromosomes. InDel markers
specifically designed between O. sativa and O. meyeriana may also be used for
chromosomes 6 and 10. This is the first time that genome-wide InDel markers were

designed for the differentiation of AA and GG genomes.


Drought Stress Response of O. granulata and O. sativa

The members of the O. granulata complex are claimed to be drought tolerant by
some researchers (Wu et al. 2004; Qian et al. 2006), but others say otherwise (Ammiraju
et al. 2010; Sanchez et al. 2014; Shakiba and Eizenga 2014). Thus, in this study, O.
granulata 102118 was subjected to seedling-stage drought stress, and its response was

compared with cultivated rice O. sativa IR64.

Root Traits

Root architecture is key to plant drought avoidance, wherein plants avoid water
stress by root elongation and ability to penetrate hard soil (Kato et al. 2008). When
maximum root depth, dry weight, root length density, percent lateral roots, and total root
length were investigated in O. sativa and O. granulata seed and clone (Fig. 8), variations
among genotypes and treatment were observed. However, no significant differences were
found in the genotype: treatment interaction; this result implies that the drought stress
treatment did not affect root response in all genotypes (P<0.05). Furthermore, large
standard error (SE) values were computed as shown by the error bars in the graphs, which
probably affected the groupings. The SE values may have been caused by the non-uniform

environment where the set-up was placed.

Figure 9 shows the relative humidity (RH) and temperature measured near the
drought set-up throughout the experiment. Up until September 19, 2016, which spanned
more than 80% of the experiment, temperature and RH had an inverse relationship with

each other. From August 29, 2016 to the morning of September 04, 2016 the highest values

of RH were observed from 5:00 AM to 6:30 AM. In the afternoon of September 04, 2016,
RH suddenly rose at 2:00 PM and peaked at 3:30 PM. In the succeeding days until
September 19, 2016, the highest RH values were observed from 1:00 AM to 6:30 AM.
However, the lowest RH values during this time were higher than the past days, indicating
a more humid environment. In the third to the last day of observation, RH values were not
going down for the whole day, and the temperature values were relatively low. In the last
two days of observation, the RH values went down a little, but the temperature values were
still low. These last three days of observation must have affected the set-up the most,

because the plants during this stage were more rapidly growing and taking up more water

than the earlier part of the experiment. Also, the location of the set-up was near the edge

of the roof, where raindrops must have entered the tubes and watered some of the plants.

Nevertheless, the root traits of O. granulata had significantly lower values than O.
sativa regardless of treatment except for root dry weight and root-to-shoot ratio. In terms
of maximum root depth, the three genotypes all had deeper reach into the soil in the well-
watered treatment compared with the drought stress treatment, implying that none of the
genotypes had further elongation of roots in the latter treatment to reach more water at the
bottom of the soil. In terms of the root dry weight, the seed-derived and clone-derived O.
granulata plants were grouped differently, suggesting that the two genotypes cannot be
used interchangeably in experiments. The clone-derived plants had already obtained more
biomass than the seed-derived ones because they were tillers obtained from older plants.
In the total root length and root length density traits, the values in the drought set-up were
higher than the well-watered set-up in all genotypes, suggesting that the plants responded
to drought by building more roots laterally to take up more water. The percent lateral values
almost had no difference in both set-ups in all genotypes. In terms of root-to-shoot ratio
values, no significant difference was found across all genotypes and treatments.
Nevertheless, the seed-derived O. granulata plants had the highest values regardless of
treatment, suggesting that these plants allotted more energy in their roots than the shoots
compared with O. sativa. This trait may be important in the adaptation of O. granulata in
water-limited soils and can be explored further in a more uniform environment. Generally,
the tested O. granulata accession did not show drought avoidance root traits that were

superior to O. sativa.


Shoot Traits

Rice is also known to have reduced plant height and lower dry matter production
when subjected to drought (Kumar et al. 2015). Figure 10 shows the plant response to
drought of O. sativa and O. granulata in terms of shoot dry weight, tiller number, and plant
height. No significant difference in the genotype: treatment interaction was found in tiller
number and plant height (P<0.05), suggesting that drought stress did not affect the response
of all genotypes tested. Genotypes were also grouped together in terms of tiller number
regardless of treatment. The plant height of O. sativa was grouped differently from the two
genotypes of O. granulata regardless of treatment. Out of all the traits tested, significant
difference was found in the genotype: treatment interaction in terms of shoot dry weight
(P<0.05). However, the resulting groupings still did not show different response of the

genotypes from the well-watered treatment when subjected to drought.

Water Uptake

Figure 11 shows the trend of water uptake by the three genotypes, where the two
O. granulata genotypes showed almost the same response. The O. sativa plants showed
higher water uptake than the other two and generally in an increasing trend because of plant
growth. This trend can be supported by the root and shoot trait values obtained for O.
sativa, which are comparably higher than those of O. granulata. In both set-ups, the water
uptake suddenly went down on the sixth day of measurement. These measurements were
obtained from September 13, 2016 to September 15, 2016. By looking at the RH and
temperature data from Figure 9, the RH changed its pattern to relatively more humid
values. Thus, less water was transpired from the plants and the moisture from the air might

have wetted the soil during these dates, making the water uptake values decrease.

In the drought stress set-up, the water uptake values of the clone-derived and seed-
derived O. granulata plants showed difference from each other. These two genotypes have
also different values from O. sativa. The trends shown in the drought stress set-up may be
supported by the root and shoot dry mass and height values observed. Water uptake was
generally decreasing towards the end of the study but suddenly increased in the latter part

of the experiment probably because of higher relative humidity and lower temperature.

O. granulata was generally not performing superiorly compared with O. sativa in
this study in terms of the used parameters for drought response, except for the root-to-shoot
ratio trait. In the mentioned trait, the clone-derived and seed-derived O. granulata plants
have significantly different responses in terms of root dry weight, suggesting that they

cannot always be used interchangeably in drought experiments. Additionally, O. granulata

was harder to germinate compared with O. sativa. Thus, the germination rate of O.
granulata cannot be used as a donor trait for breeding.

Nevertheless, O. granulata may have other mechanisms in adapting to water-
limited environments. O. granulata naturally lives on fully shaded forest floors, where
moisture is still present and shade is protecting the plants from high transpiration. Its
relatively small shoot structure and dark green leaves may be helping it thrive in low-
moisture soil. In addition, the roots of the clone-derived O. granulata plants used in the
present study are woody and hard. This trait may be contributing to its survival in dry lands
by being able to penetrate hard soil. Also, the species tend to allot more of its energy
reserves to the roots instead of the shoots, based on the root-to-shoot ratio values. Other
possible drought resistance-contributing traits that can be investigated in O. granulata are
the level of greenness of its leaves, suberin content and topography in the roots, and hard
soil penetrability. Drought stress may also be tested in other stages of development and

different level of severity in O. granulata or interspecific hybrid-derived lines.

Stomatal Density

In 2018, Caine et al. discovered that fewer stomata in rice leaves contributes in
drought tolerance by requiring less water to survive and having enough water to cool itself
in arid conditions. Additionally, low stomata were also associated with low stomatal
conductance, which is related to photosynthesis (Ouyang et al. 2017). At the time of the
present study, no literature is available on the study of stomatal density and stomatal size

in wild rice species. Figure 12 shows the mean stomatal density of cultivated rice species

O. glaberrima, O. longistaminata, O. punctata, O. australiensis, O. granulata. Based on
the graph, these drought tolerant species have 269-472 stomata/mm? stomatal density, with
O. granulata 102118 having 317-378 stomata/mm?. O. sativa IR64, which is not drought
tolerant, was found to have the highest stomatal density (632 stomata/mm?). When the leaf
width and length were analyzed in terms of their contribution to stomatal density, weak
correlation was found (Fig. 13). Leaf width has a very weak negative correlation with

stomatal density, whereas leaf length showed weak positive correlation with stomatal

density. The contribution of stomatal density to drought tolerance may also be tested in a
drought-treatment experimental set-up.

Stomatal size and arrangement may also be important traits contributing to drought
tolerance. Figure 14 shows images of the cultivated and wild rice species scratched
epidermis. At 10X magnification, the stomata of each species can be seen to have different
arrangements and sizes. O. coarctata showed the lowest stomatal density and had relatively
larger stomatal size compared with other species. In a study by Hughes et al. (2017), several
evidences were cited on the negative correlation between stomatal density and size.

With the species of interest O. sativa and O. granulata having different stomatal
densities, the tested trait may be a factor of O. granulata drought response such that water
loss is prevented through lower transpiration. However, this claim must be tested first in a

drought experiment.

CHAPTER 5

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Rice (Oryza sativa L.), the second most planted cereal in the world, has lost genes
that are important in stress tolerance and resistance during domestication. Classical and
transgenic breeding have been done by researchers to transfer stress tolerance genes to rice.
These genes may be sourced out from wild relatives of rice, which include the O. granulata
complex. The members of this complex, namely O. granulata and O. meyeriana were
found to possess drought tolerance genes. However, the mode of action of their drought
response and useful markers that can be used in breeding are not yet available. Thus, the
present study aimed to develop genome-wide InDel markers to differentiate AA and GG
genomes in rice and determine the potential of O. granulata as donor of drought tolerance
genes. Specifically, the study aimed to design InDel primers to detect polymorphisms
among O. sativa, O. granulata, and O. meyeriana; to compare InDel markers to SSR
markers; and to determine drought stress response of O. granulata and O. sativa by

considering root and shoot traits and stomatal density.

A total of 94 InDel primers that can be used in screening interspecific hybrids
between AA and GG genomes were manually designed and tested for polymorphism
among O. sativa, O. granulata, and O. meyeriana. The applicability of these markers was
compared with that of SSR markers. The designed InDel markers were shown to have
remarkably higher rate of polymorphism (93.18%) between AA and GG genomes

compared with SSR markers (25.93%). These InDel markers may be used in breeding

programs to identify plants that have introgressions from the species with GG genome O.
granulata and O. meyeriana. Low rates of polymorphism (1.11%-9.09%) were found
when distinguishing between different accessions and within the same genome using both
InDel and SSR markers. Thus, the designed primers may be limitedly applicable in
diversity studies among O. granulata and O. meyeriana accessions and species in the O.
granulata complex. However, a larger sample size will be needed for testing before coming
up with an acceptable conclusion regarding the usefulness of InDel markers in genetic

diversity studies in these Oryza species.

Asa preliminary step in its use in interspecific hybridization, O. granulata was also
evaluated as a donor plant for drought tolerance in rice through seedling stage drought
physiology set-up and morphological and stomatal density analyses, which have not been
done in wild rice species. In general, O. granulata did not show superior drought response
traits over O. sativa except for root to shoot ratio. Nevertheless, improvement in the set-up
for the drought experiment, that is, providing a more uniform environment for the plants,
can still be done in the future in order to lessen standard error values. Since the stomatal
density of O. granulata (317-378 stomata/mm7’) is less than that of O. sativa (632
stomata/mm2), this trait can be tested in a drought set-up in future studies. Other traits such
as stomatal size, hard soil penetrability, suberin content, and greenness of leaves response
to drought stress can be investigated in O. granulata in future studies. Preliminary tests on
the response of the target donor parent material for breeding for drought stress, which is
governed by complex mechanisms are indeed necessary before proceeding to a breeding

program in order to have efficient usage of materials, costs, and efforts.
