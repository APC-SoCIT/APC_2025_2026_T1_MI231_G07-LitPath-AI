ABSTRACT

Addressing the longstanding concern of bridging theoretical learning with
practical applications remains crucial in education. To tackle this challenge, educators
must embrace innovative instructional approaches that integrate students’ real-world
experiences. This study investigated the synergistic influence of Design-Based Biology
Education (DBE) on students’ cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary
thinking. Moreover, it examined how academic resilience moderates the effects of DBE
on these outcome variables, alongside investigating whether transdisciplinary thinking predicts cognitive flexibility and growth mindset among biology students. The study was conducted using a three-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental
design and involved 141 senior high school students from a public school in Quezon
City. These students were divided into three groups: Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE), Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and Non-Design-Based Biology Education
(NDBE). The researcher employed a parallel lesson plan across all groups, focusing on empathetic understanding as a critical element in the DBE intervention. Data collection encompassed both quantitative and qualitative methods.
Quantitative data were gathered through Likert scales, including the Cognitive Flexibility
Inventory (CFI), Mindset Theory Scale (MTS), Filipino Learners’ Academic Resilience
Scale (FLARS), and Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS). The researcher obtained
qualitative data from student journal entries, focus group discussions, student output, and
daily observational notes. Instrument validation was ensured through expert panels and pilot testing. Levene’s test assessed the variance in mean pretest ratings across the three intact
classes on the four scales, ensuring comparability before intervention. Following this, a
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the mean posttest ratings of
the Likert scales to establish intervention effects. Significant differences were further
explored through post-hoc analysis using Tukey’s HSD, with effect size computed to
gauge outcome variability attributable to the intervention. Additionally, moderated
regression analysis was employed to explore whether academic resilience moderated the
impact of DBE on cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking.
Subsequently, simple linear regression analysis investigated whether transdisciplinary
thinking positively predicted both cognitive flexibility and growth mindset. Furthermore,
qualitative analyses complemented these findings, with thematic analysis enriching the
interpretation of quantitative data. As a result, an emergent instructional innovation
framework emerged from the interaction between independent and dependent variables, providing valuable insights into effective instructional strategies. The results highlighted the significant impact of teaching approaches, particularly
the integration of empathetic elements, on student outcomes. Notably, Design-Based
Biology Education (DBE) emerged as a potent enhancer of students’ cognitive flexibility,
growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. Conversely, Problem-Based Learning
(PBL) demonstrated effectiveness primarily in improving students’ transdisciplinary
thinking. Moreover, academic resilience played a paramount role in moderating the
effects of DBE on the outcome variables, with its influence varying across different levels of resilience. Furthermore, the study explained the positive prediction of transdisciplinary thinking on students’ cognitive flexibility and growth mindset. From these findings, five core teaching strategies surfaced, describing essential elements for
effective instructional innovation. These strategies encompassed integrating the design
thinking process with empathetic approaches, fostering resilience through tailored
activities, promoting interdisciplinary projects and collaborative learning, explicit
instruction on growth mindset principles, and adopting authentic assessment methods.
Together, these strategies formed the foundation of the emergent instructional innovation
framework, offering valuable insights for educators seeking to optimize student learning experiences. Implications of the findings extend to improving biology education by addressing
theory-practice gaps through DBE. Moreover, future research avenues could explore the
broader impact of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) on additional constructs such
as systems thinking, engagement, critical thinking, and metacognitive self-regulation, all
of which emerged as significant themes from the qualitative data. These avenues promise
a deeper understanding of how DBE influences various facets of student learning and
development. Furthermore, there is scope for conducting parallel studies that address the
limitations identified in this research. By refining methodologies, expanding sample
sizes, or exploring different educational contexts, subsequent studies can further clarify
DBE implementation and its effects on student outcomes. Such parallel investigations
would enrich the existing body of literature and contribute to the ongoing discourse surrounding innovative instructional approaches in biology education.

INTRODUCTION

Background of the Study

The challenge of connecting classroom learning to real-life experiences has long
been a concern in education. Learners often question the relevance of their science
lessons to their daily lives, prompting educators to seek potent ways of bridging this gap
and making learning more meaningful. In the 21st-century classroom, the importance of
creating profound instructional practices that resonate with students’ experiences cannot
be overstated. To address this need, a careful design of classroom instruction is

imperative.

The discourse surrounding Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) and its
implications within the educational territory is multifaceted and inherently interconnected
with constructs such as academic resilience, cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and
transdisciplinary thinking. Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) is an innovative
pedagogical approach integrating design thinking principles into biology education. It
emphasizes hands-on, experiential learning and problem-based inquiry to engage students
in authentic scientific practices and real-world applications. In DBE, students actively
design solutions to complex biological problems, fostering critical thinking, creativity,
and collaboration. This approach encourages students to explore connections between
biological concepts and their broader social, ethical, and environmental implications,

preparing them for the dynamic challenges of the modern world (Brown, 2008).

In the Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) context, the mentioned constructs
are pivotal in shaping students’ learning experiences and outcomes. Academic resilience
is indispensable in DBE, enabling students to persist and excel amidst the challenges
inherent in interdisciplinary and problem-based learning (Jowkar et al., 2019). Likewise,
cognitive flexibility is paramount for DBE students, empowering them to adjust their
thinking and problem-solving strategies to confront diverse and complex biological
concepts and challenges (Spiro et al., 1988). Moreover, fostering a growth mindset is
crucial within DBE, instilling in students the belief in their capacity to learn and grow,
even amid difficulties (Dweck, 2019). Furthermore, transdisciplinary thinking is
foundational in DBE, encouraging students to comprehensively merge knowledge from
multiple disciplines to address complex biological issues (Nicolescu, 2010). This
narrative begins by exposing the foundational principles of Design Thinking (DT), a
problem-solving methodology rooted in empathy, iteration, and holistic problem solving.
As Braun and Clarke (2022) and Razzouk and Shute (2012) assert, DT originated from
design and innovation entities like IDEO and Stanford University's d.school, evolving
significantly to encompass various domains, including education. This evolution has
pointed out DT's potential to foster critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving
skills, making it a promising avenue for preparing students for the dynamic field of

biology (Chon & Sim, 2019; Verganti et al., 2021).

In the Philippine education context, design thinking in biology education, termed
Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), presents opportunities and challenges. The
recent results of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2018 and

2022 revealed that the Philippines scored below the average performance of other

participating countries, sparking discussions on factors such as curriculum relevance,
education quality, and socioeconomic disparities (Idil et al., 2024: Schleicher, 2019).
These findings emphasize the importance of aligning the curriculum with students’ needs
and interests to improve learning outcomes (Bernardo et al., 2023). However, integrating
design thinking into the curriculum requires extensive teacher training and adaptation,
with potential implications for standardized testing outcomes (Albay & Eisma, 2021;
Revano & Garcia, 2021). Therefore, comprehensive research is needed to unlock the full
potential of DBE and its impact on student outcomes, scientific literacy, and problem-

solving skills (Paderna & Monterola, 2021).

Moreover, the narrative stresses the need for innovative and engaging educational
approaches that resonate with students’ real-life experiences. Lin et al. (2021) advocate
for designing learning activities grounded in real-life contexts, which bridge the gap
between theoretical learning and practical application. This approach cultivates practical
knowledge and problem-solving skills among students, making learning more meaningful
and applicable to real-world issues. Furthermore, incorporating a human-centered
problem solving approach remains relatively unexplored in biology education (Kijima et
al., 2021). The transformative potential of integrating design thinking into educational
practices has been evident in enhancing students’ creative confidence and interest in

STEM subjects (Kijima et al., 2021).

In this context, the pedagogical strengths of design thinking within a collaborative
learning environment are paramount. The active participation of students in constructing
authentic projects fosters hands-on experiential learning and empowers them to tackle

real-life issues creatively. Additionally, an interdisciplinary approach to problem solving

facilitates the development of transdisciplinary thinking skills, promoting social
awareness and responsibility among learners (Alwi & Hussin, 2018). This approach
highlights integrating students' knowledge from various disciplines when addressing
complex problems, ensuring learners acquire subject-specific skills and navigate
transdisciplinary contexts effectively. Additionally, the importance of DBE in fostering
Sustainable Development Goal 4, focusing on promoting quality education, cannot be
overstated. DBE emphasizes active learning, critical thinking, and problem solving,
aligning closely with the goals of SDG 4 to ensure inclusive and quality education for all.
By integrating DBE principles into educational practices, educators can create
environments that empower students to become lifelong learners equipped with the skills
necessary to address the challenges of the 21st century and contribute meaningfully to
sustainable development (Saini et al., 2023).

Furthermore, cognitive and behavioral competencies such as academic resilience,
cognitive flexibility, and growth mindset are crucial in navigating real-world challenges.
Integrating creative problem solving into educational practices cultivates these
competencies, enabling students to adapt to diverse situations and approach problem
solving with a growth-oriented mindset (Ritter & Mostert, 2017). Thus, the narrative
underlines the significance of DBE in fostering critical thinking, creativity, and problem-
solving skills among students, ultimately preparing them for success in biology

education.

Therefore, this current research plans to uncover the complex dynamics of
academic resilience, explaining its moderating role in the relationships between the

independent and dependent variables, which are also under investigation. Additionally,

the study seeks to explore the predictive capacity of transdisciplinary thinking concerning
the aforementioned dependent variables, and such interactions would guide this
investigation to formulating an instructional innovation framework, thereby contributing
to a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted impacts of DBE on high school

students within the territory of biology education.

Statement of the Problem

This study explored the multifaceted impacts of Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE) on students’ cognitive development. The primary focus is on three vital cognitive
dimensions: cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. It

cognitive aspects. The research seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of how
DBE influences students’ problem-solving abilities and the cultivation of mindsets
conducive to adaptable and holistic thinking. By examining these cognitive dimensions,
this study aimed to contribute valuable insights into DBE's transformative potential in

shaping students’ cognitive domain.

In addition to investigating the direct effects of DBE on cognitive development,
this research explored the role of academic resilience as a potential mediator. Academic
resilience, an often-understudied facet of educational psychology, was postulated to
moderate the relationship between DBE and cognitive development. By exploring how
academic resilience operates as an underlying mechanism, this study cleared up the
complicated pathways through which DBE influences the cultivation of cognitive

flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking among students. This

moderating role of academic resilience served as a critical bridge in understanding DBE's
cognitive development dynamics. Also, it provided sufficient details for crafting an

flexibility, transdisciplinary thinking skills, and growth mindset.

Moreover, this investigation examined the potential moderating role of academic
resilience in the relationships between the independent and dependent variables. This
study aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms at play
in the educational process by exploring whether academic resilience is a mediator.
Additionally, this research determined whether transdisciplinary thinking can predict
cognitive flexibility and the development of a growth mindset among learners. Then, this
exploration from these interactions developed an emergent instructional innovation

framework.

Furthermore, the outcomes of this study held relevance for a diverse range of
educational stakeholders, including a) Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) and Training

Design Thinking

Design thinking (DT) is a dynamic problem-solving methodology that emphasizes
human-centered solutions, resulting in improved products, services, and internal
operations for organizations. This approach, credited to Tim Brown, the CEO of IDEO,
emerged in 2008 as a response to the pressing need to address customer challenges
through empathetic observation of human interactions with their environments. DT's core
principles revolve around iterative and practical techniques that pave the way for
innovative problem resolution. Interestingly, the roots of DT trace back to the 1940s and
1950s, a period marked by significant advancements in psychological studies on
creativity and the development of various techniques to enhance creative thinking

(Brown, 2008).

Leveraging the potential of design thinking necessitates a structured approach
encompassing distinct stages and procedures. This process unfolds in a logical sequence,
consisting of five core steps: 1) empathizing and observing, 2) defining the problem, 3)
generating creative ideas, 4) constructing prototypes, and 5) rigorously testing these
prototypes. This systematic framework serves as a guiding light for designers, whether
educators or students, embarking on the journey of design thinking within the classroom.
The initial stage involves empathizing, where designers (the learners) immerse
themselves in the problem space, gaining profound insights into the issue at hand and
comprehending the specific needs and perspectives of the intended audience.
Subsequently, the amassed data form the foundation for defining the problem accurately,
shaping a view that aligns with the user's requirements. As the process advances, creative

brainstorming sessions come into play, fostering the development of innovative solutions

that cater to the user's objectives. These conceptual ideas then transition into tangible
forms as designers collaborate to create models and representations, lending substance to
their imaginative concepts. Finally, the prototypes undergo rigorous testing, validating
their effectiveness and revealing areas for enhancement. While this process appears
linear, it is essential to note that it often manifests as a dynamic and nonlinear progression
in practice. Various stages may overlap, with team members frequently revisiting prior
phases to refine their ideas based on testing outcomes, fostering a culture of continuous

improvement and collaboration (Noel & Liu, 2017).

As design thinking evolved, many recent studies have been made on DT in other
fields like business (Radnejad et al., 2021: Volkova & Jakobsone, 2016), engineering
(Alhazmi & Huang, 2020; Eddington et al., 2020; Ezequiel et al., 2019), computer
science (Sohaib et al., 2019), and education (Arnab et al., 2019; Geng et al., 2019;

Guaman-Quintanilla et al., 2022; McLaughlin et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2019).

Within the sphere of business, researchers Volkova and Jakobsone (2016)
highlight the significance of design thinking application in fostering the development of
fresh organizational capacities. When harnessed effectively, these capacities are vital for
maintaining competitiveness despite formidable business challenges. Moreover, such
strategic deployment of design thinking holds the potential to enhance societal well-being
and contribute to the creation of a more favorable living environment. Building upon this
premise, Radnejad et al. (2021) further emphasize the adaptive nature of a design-
thinking mindset, particularly in response to disruptive innovations. The confluence of

these findings strongly suggests that design thinking is a viable and successful approach

when applied to process innovation, with the capacity to not only navigate business

complexities but also foster innovation and societal betterment.

Furthermore, the study by Eddington et al. (2020) provides compelling evidence
for the efficacy of design thinking in addressing and resolving complex cultural conflicts
within organizational settings, particularly in engineering. This stresses the versatile
applicability of design thinking beyond traditional problem-solving paradigms.
Regarding requirements engineering, Alhazmi and Huang (2020) highlight how design
thinking has significantly enriched the established Scrum requirements engineering
process. Doing so effectively surmounts various challenges, offering a holistic
comprehension of customers' needs and preferences. Similarly, Kahan et al. (2019)
emphasize the instrumental role of design thinking practices in surmounting
contemporary hurdles in requirements engineering. Collectively, these findings underline
the pivotal role of design thinking in the engineering domain, facilitating the
development of innovative problem solving approaches and serving as a catalyst for

conflict resolution and improved conflict resolution strategies.

Similarly, in software development, the study conducted by Sohaib et al. (2019)
stands as a testament to the integration of design thinking (DT) techniques within the
framework of extreme programming (XP). This innovative approach was devised to
tackle the difficult challenges associated with crafting software applications that align
seamlessly with the requirements and preferences of end-users. The outcomes of this
research illuminate the substantial benefits derived from the amalgamation of DT
practices into the XP methodology. Notably, this synergy contributes to an elevated

caliber of software products tailored to meet the discerning expectations of end-users.


Moreover, it catalyzes an environment conducive to fostering creativity and innovation
within businesses. These findings emphasize the versatility of DT concepts, showcasing
their utility in comprehensively analyzing the complexities of customer and user

involvement within the dynamic situation of XP projects.

Conversely, most design thinking studies in science education have primarily
targeted college students and in-service and pre-service teachers. For instance, a study by
Geng et al. (2019) revealed a stark reality among in-service teachers, with only a minute
fraction equipped with the requisite skills to formulate innovative solutions for emerging
challenges in STEM education. These findings point out a pressing necessity for
implementing structured professional development initiatives firmly grounded in design
thinking principles. Such programs should also encompass pedagogical guidance and
curricular resources, empowering educators to integrate STEM education into their
instructional practices effectively. Furthermore, Wu (2019) explored diverse scaffolding
strategies that could shape the development of design-thinking competence among pre-
service STEM teachers. The study outcomes illuminated the distinctions between two
groups: the dynamic scaffolding group, which received predefined guiding questions, and
the adaptive scaffolding group, which benefited from conditional scaffolding provided by
a tutor. This differentiation in scaffolding approaches revealed distinct developmental
trajectories and patterns in design thinking skills. These findings imply that scaffolding
interventions promise to address multifaceted challenges in collaborative STEM learning
design while bolstering the enhancement of design-thinking competence through a

multidimensional lens.


Similarly, design thinking (DT) has found a valuable application in higher
education, fostering the development of behavioral and cognitive competencies among
college students. In a study conducted by Guaman-Quintanilla et al. (2022), the impact of
design thinking on students’ problem solving and creativity skills was rigorously
examined. Engaging university students across various academic disciplines in
collaborative endeavors, the research yielded promising outcomes. The results revealed
substantial advancements in students’ creativity and problem-solving abilities,
substantiating the efficacy of the design thinking approach in enhancing these essential
skills. Consequently, design thinking-supported pedagogical practices emerge as a potent
means of equipping students with the competencies demanded by contemporary labor

markets.

Moreover, as McLaughlin et al. (2019) highlighted, the rapidly evolving
educational setting necessitates college students to possess a repertoire of critical,
creative, and collaborative skills essential for navigating the details of contemporary
society's complex challenges. To realize this imperative, integrating design thinking into
the curriculum and professional development training for educators becomes paramount.
By equipping teachers with the pedagogical tools and insights needed to effectively
employ design thinking in their teaching practices, higher education institutions can
empower their students to thrive academically and develop the adaptive skill set

demanded by the evolving job market.

In a parallel vein, Arnab et al. (2019) investigated the transformative potential of
game design thinking in scaffolding co-creativity among learners within higher education

settings. Their research unveiled that designing, developing, and engaging with games


infused with design thinking principles amplified content knowledge acquisition, fortified
collaborative aptitudes, and cultivated an appreciation for diverse talents and
perspectives. The creativity and co-creativity engendered through the application of
design thinking in conjunction with gaming elements demonstrated the capacity to
engender lasting shifts in students’ mindsets and practices. This, in turn, holds the
promise of influencing their academic pursuits, their engagement with the broader

community, and their future contributions to the professional setting.

Furthermore, within education, design thinking unfolds in a structured
progression comprising distinct analytical and synthetic phases. Learners' proactive
engagement in discovery characterizes the analytical phase, exploring existing theories
and keen observation of the contextual environment to unearth viable solutions to
prevailing challenges. This initial stage aligns with the fundamental principles of
empathetic understanding and the expression of diverse perspectives as learners endeavor
to grasp the complexities of the issues at hand. In parallel, the synthetic phase emerges as
the crucible for generating and cultivating innovative ideas. This phase encompasses a
dynamic sequence encompassing ideation, prototyping, and rigorous testing, all geared
toward crafting tangible solutions. Importantly, these sequential design thinking phases
are inherently interconnected, with creative problem solving commencing in ideation and
culminating in the rigorous testing and refinement of the envisioned solutions, as
expounded by Luka (2014). This holistic approach stresses the iterative and dynamic
nature of design thinking, where each phase informs and enriches the others, ultimately

fostering innovative and effective problem solving.


Table 1 summarizes the fundamental concepts of Design Thinking (DT) and its

applications in various fields, including business, engineering, computer science, and

education. It also highlights the implications of DT in enhancing problem solving,

organizational culture, and creativity while emphasizing the iterative and empathetic

nature of the process. Additionally, it explores the different phases of DT and their

interconnectedness, emphasizing their role in supporting creative problem solving.

As an innovative problem solving approach, design thinking encompasses various
strategies and techniques designed to tackle complex challenges creatively. Two
prominent methodologies that fall under the umbrella of design thinking are Problem-
Based Learning (PBL) and Project-Based Learning (PjBL). These pedagogical
approaches share commonalities with design thinking, emphasizing active learning,
critical thinking, and real-world application. PBL and PjBL encourage students to engage
deeply with content, collaborate with peers, and develop solutions to authentic problems,
mirroring the iterative and user-centered nature of design thinking. While each approach
has its unique characteristics, they all converge in their aim to foster a holistic learning
experience that transcends traditional classroom boundaries, promoting cognitive

flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking in students.


In the subsequent section, this literature review will explore the principles and
applications of both PBL and PjBL, highlighting their alignment with design thinking and

their potential to enhance cognitive development in educational contexts.
Problem-Based Learning (PBL)

Motivation is a cornerstone in education, knottily linked to students' performance
and learning outcomes. It is the fuel that propels them toward excellence and the driving
force behind the creation of valuable knowledge. Educators, in this context, emerge as the
architects of inspiration, shaping the teaching and learning process. Problem-based
learning (PBL) shines as a proven catalyst for motivation among the various pedagogical
approaches. PBL engages students in collaborative exploration of real-world problems,
igniting their motivation and nurturing vital life skills due to its practical and

multidisciplinary nature (Tan, 2021).

For many years, the educational domain has witnessed a growing interest in the
Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach, primarily for its remarkable capacity to bridge
the gap between community contexts and learning environments, enhancing individual
and collective learning experiences. The roots of PBL trace back to its inception in the
1960s, when it found its initial foothold within the domain of medical education.
However, it wasn't until the 1980s and 90s that PBL's transformative potential began to
be harnessed within K-12 educational settings. During this evolutionary period, PBL
emerged as a catalyst for self-directed and collaborative knowledge construction, with the
authentic problem serving as its central nucleus. In this paradigm, learners embarked on a
journey of inquiry-driven exploration, digging into the essence of the issues before

formulating innovative and pragmatic solutions (Tawfik et al., 2021).


Problem-based learning (PBL) adheres to foundational principles accurately
designed to enhance students' comprehension and competencies. These guiding tenets
encompass contextual, constructive, collaborative, and self-directed facets, ensuring a

holistic and effective approach to learning (Wang & Zhao, 2021).

As emphasized by Baran and Sozbilir (2018), the essence of contextual learning
within the framework of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) manifests through a
multifaceted array of meaningful contexts, allowing students to connect abstract concepts
with real-world scenarios seamlessly. This deliberate emphasis on contextual learning
catalyzes heightened engagement among learners, fostering a profound appreciation for
the intrinsic linkages between subject matter content and real-life applications. Educators
play a pivotal role in nurturing this engagement in the classroom by skillfully presenting
learners with familiar, real-life situations replete with realistic examples and authentic
problems, thereby facilitating the seamless integration of contextual learning within the

PBL paradigm.

Likewise, in Problem-Based Learning (PBL), promoting constructive learning
hinges upon strategically deploying incisive inquiries. These well-crafted questions serve
as conduits, opening the floodgates of learner awareness to the profound reality that
singular correct answers do not bind questions; instead, they serve as vessels for myriad
perspectives and viewpoints. This diversity of perspectives validates the diverse array of
thoughts and features the notion that knowledge construction is a collaborative endeavor,
intertwining new information with past experiences. This fusion of elements epitomizes
constructive learning, empowering students to apply their newfound knowledge to real-

world situations. Moreover, this pedagogical approach nurtures a profound sense of


control and commitment within learners. In the classroom setting, educators can facilitate
this process by encouraging students to leverage their prior knowledge to define and
contextualize unfamiliar concepts introduced within the scope of new lesson materials, as

clarified by John and Thomas (2018).

In parallel, the tenets of collaborative learning within the framework of Problem-
Based Learning (PBL) foster an environment where learners unite under a common
shared goal, relying on the collective contributions of each member to surmount
challenges and resolve complex problems. This cardinal principle of PBL invites learners
to approach complex issues from diverse vantage points, fostering active listening and
enhancing their communicative prowess. Educators are pivotal in cultivating
collaborative learning experiences by crafting problem-solving assignments, inviting
multiple interpretations, and eliciting various viewpoints while formulating solutions.
These assignments must necessitate group effort, instigating each member's engagement
in explaining concepts to their peers. This orchestration ensures that deeper learning is
not merely an aspiration but a tangible outcome, as expounded by Hendarwati et al.

(2021).

Furthermore, a fundamental pillar of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) is the
cultivation of self-directed learning among learners, wherein they assume an active role
in identifying their learning needs, formulating learning objectives, sourcing relevant
learning materials, judiciously employing effective learning strategies, and appraising the
outcomes of their learning journey. This emphasis on self-directed learning is
underpinned by the rationale that students are more likely to glean knowledge effectively

when they wield control over the flow of information from their experiences.


Consequently, students are nurtured into becoming more responsible and adeptly
prepared to navigate the details of the contemporary workforce. Facilitating the evolution
of self-directed learning within the classroom requires educators to motivate learners to
establish and manage their learning objectives, thus instilling the essence of goal-setting.
These tasks must be progressively presented and conducted with ascending levels of

complexity to scaffold the development of this vital skill set.

These findings highlight the importance of actively fostering engagement and
interaction among students, coupled with the encouragement to tap into their reservoir of
prior knowledge and experiences. Additionally, cultivating the habits of elaboration and
reflection in the learning process emerges as imperative. The small group structure
inherent in Problem-Based Learning (PBL) is a valuable facilitator of this heightened
engagement. Within these small groups, students are encouraged to engage in reciprocal
questioning, explore alternative viewpoints, and actively participate in shaping their
learning objectives. It's worth noting that these four fundamental learning principles,
which underpin PBL, find their theoretical underpinnings in various educational theories.
These theories have served as the intellectual framework supporting the implementation
and efficacy of PBL, including constructivism, transformative learning, experiential
learning, social learning, information processing, cooperative learning, cognitive load

theory, and discovery learning, as Gewurtz et al. (2016) expanded.

Several studies have recently investigated the effect of PBL in developing
learners’ achievement and behavioral skills. These effects of PBL have been commonly
studied in various fields of education, such as physics (Fidan & Tuncel, 2019) and

mathematics (Ramadhani et al., 2019; Siagan et al., 2019; Tambunan, 2019).


The study conducted by Fidan and Tuncel (2019) with Grade 7 students unveiled
the benefits of integrating augmented reality into Problem-Based Learning (PBL)
activities, resulting in increased learning achievement and more positive attitudes toward
physics subjects among the learners. However, the study also highlighted the potential for
even more significant gains in learning retention by combining PBL with innovative
teaching approaches. Similarly, Ramadhani et al. (2019) implemented a Flipped-
Problem-Based Learning model using the LMS-Google Classroom to teach mathematics
to high school students. The results demonstrated a significant increase in the average
mathematics learning outcomes of students who were exposed to this approach compared
to conventional teaching methods. Furthermore, Tambunan (2019) conducted a study that
employed a problem-solving strategy with a scientific approach, leading to notable
improvements in students' mathematical abilities, including enhanced communication,
creativity, problem solving, and mathematical reasoning skills. These findings suggest
that PBL can be even more effective when thoughtfully integrated with complementary

teaching approaches, ultimately enhancing the overall learning experience.

Furthermore, Siagan et al. (2019) emphasized the crucial role of well-developed
problem-solving learning materials in ensuring a substantial impact of Problem-Based
Learning (PBL) on mathematics learning and metacognition. This highlights the
importance of educators effectively guiding students through PBL by providing
instruction and appropriate materials to cultivate specific skills. However. it's essential to
acknowledge certain challenges associated with PBL in the teaching and learning
process. Firstly, PBL may demand more time, potentially taking away from study hours

dedicated to other subjects. Secondly, issues related to group dynamics can sometimes


compromise the effectiveness of PBL. Lastly, the unfamiliarity with the PBL process
may delay its implementation. Those implementing the PBL approach must possess
adequate knowledge and time management skills to address these challenges.
Additionally, when integrating PBL with other teaching approaches, careful
consideration should be given to minimize the potential risks associated with PBL

(Pawson et al., 2019).

In summary, Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Design Thinking are
intrinsically connected by emphasizing active engagement, collaborative problem
solving, and integrating real-world contexts. PBL's foundation in contextual,
constructive, collaborative, and self-directed learning principles aligns with the core
tenets of Design Thinking, where empathy, ideation, and prototyping are central. Both
approaches nurture critical skills such as creativity, communication, and problem solving,
making them valuable tools in education and innovation. By incorporating PBL into the
broader framework of design thinking, educators and learners can harness the synergistic
power of these methodologies to address complex challenges and encourage innovative

thinking and holistic solutions.

Project-Based Learning (PjBL)

Projects are tangible manifestations of the learning process, enabling learners to
apply their acquired skills to accomplish tasks independently. Moreover, projects
encourage collaborative work, fostering the development of teamwork and group skills.
Within this context, project-based learning (PjBL) emerges as a learner-centric approach

characterized by autonomy, constructive exploration, goal establishment, collaboration,


effective communication, and reflective practice within real-world contexts. PjBL
epitomizes inquiry-based learning, providing a structured framework for tackling
authentic problems. Its foundation rests on three fundamental constructivist principles:
contextual learning, active engagement, and social learning, as outlined by Kokotsaki et
al. (2016). Through PjBL, students are empowered to explore, create, and interact,

making it a dynamic educational approach that nurtures holistic development.

To uphold the three fundamental constructivist principles while creating high-
quality projects in the classroom, integrating seven gold standards as design elements for
PjBL is imperative (refer to Table 2). These gold standards serve as invaluable
guidelines, equipping educators with the tools to implement PjBL effectively. In adhering
to the Gold Standard PjBL framework, projects are exactly crafted to center around
students’ acquisition of essential knowledge, profound understanding, and development
of crucial success skills. This comprehensive approach ensures that PjBL enhances
subject matter comprehension and nurtures students’ ability to thrive in various aspects of

their academic journey and beyond.

In recent years, Project-based Learning (PjBL) has emerged as a dynamic and

promising research focus within the field of education. This innovative approach

empowers students to explore real-world problems and challenges, leading to a more

profound comprehension of the subject matter. Through inquiry-driven processes and


collaborative group work, students autonomously navigate their learning journeys,
constructing projects that serve as tangible manifestations of their understanding and

expertise (Bell, 2010).

The significance of Project-Based Learning (PjBL) in teaching and learning is
deeply rooted in its theoretical foundations, primarily drawing from two prominent
learning theories: constructivism and constructionism. Within the framework of PjBL,
learners are not passive recipients of information but rather active knowledge builders.
They engage with the world, reflecting on their experiences through authentic hands-on
activities, and synthesize their interpretations, integrating new insights into their existing
cognitive structures or schemas (Jumaat et al., 2017). This process unfolds as students
collaboratively participate in relevant learning tasks within small groups, where each
member contributes their ideas and collectively designs and constructs engaging projects
that address real-world challenges and problems. In parallel, the constructionist learning
theory posits that learners comprehend the world by building mental models,
underscoring that the most practical knowledge construction transpires through creating

tangible and shareable artifacts (Csizmadia et al., 2019).

Teachers play a pivotal role in facilitating the transfer of learning by creating
artifacts in Project-based Learning (PjBL). They serve as effective scaffolds, guiding and
nurturing the learning process. Initially, formulating a compelling driving question is
essential to the structure and propel the learning activity. These questions should be not
only feasible and worthwhile but also profoundly contextualized. Once these questions
are presented to students, the subsequent phase involves the creation of artifacts that

represent potential solutions derived from the learners' emergent knowledge and


understanding. These tangible and concrete artifacts become valuable conduits for
sharing and critiquing throughout the learning journey. Feedback received on these
artifacts catalyzes reflective thinking among learners, fostering a dynamic process of
revising and enhancing the quality of the artifacts. Moreover, learners iteratively modify
the artifacts and engage in a systematic and authentic scientific investigation. This
investigative approach encompasses refining questions, engaging in robust debates,
formulating hypotheses, conducting experiments, gathering and analyzing data, drawing
informed conclusions, making meaningful inferences, and effectively communicating
their ideas. Throughout this multifaceted process, collaboration and interaction with
group members are integral, as they provide opportunities to explore thoughts further,
challenge existing ideas, and experiment with alternative viewpoints. Ultimately, this
comprehensive journey culminates in creating meaningful artifacts that authentically
showcase the learners’ profound understanding and mastery of the concept (Lee & Ke,

2019).

Recently, various studies mainly investigated the effects of project-based learning
in higher education, such as in engineering (Sharmaet al., 2020; Syahril et al., 2019) and
teaching fields (Abu Bakar et al., 2019; Syakur et al., 2020; Yustina et al., 2020).
However, a limited number of investigations were conducted on the impact of PjBL in

secondary education (Beier et al., 2019; Hanif et al., 2019).

The research conducted by Syarhil et al. (2019), involving a group of 20
mechanical engineering students, features the transformative impact of project-based
learning (PjBL) when combined with collaborative approaches. This pedagogical

combination enhanced their creative prowess and laid the foundation for honing practical


skills essential for their future careers. Building upon these findings, Sharma et al. (2020)
reaffirmed the effectiveness of PjBL, emphasizing its role in equipping students with the
ability to tackle real-world challenges, design innovative solutions, and cultivate
problem-solving skills. These attributes align seamlessly with the multifaceted demands
of the contemporary job market, particularly for graduates with a strong foundation in
multidisciplinary education. In a related vein, Syakur et al.'s (2020) investigation, which
integrated PjBL into the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) preparation,

yielded marked improvements in learning outcomes.

Similarly, Abu Bakar et al. (2019) demonstrated significant advancements in
learners' oral communicative competence by implementing PjJBL. This compelling body
of research emphasizes that PjBL effectively enhances learners’ communication skills,
positioning them favorably regarding employability. Effectively communicating is
undeniably one of the most sought-after skills in the contemporary workforce, further
emphasizing the practical relevance and significance of PjBL in fostering learners’

readiness for their future careers.

In science education, the research conducted by Yustina et al. (2020) is a
testament to the transformative potential of project-based learning (PjBL) within a
blended learning framework. Their findings indicate a notable increase in the creativity of
pre-service biology teachers when exposed to PjBL, underscoring its effectiveness as a
teaching strategy. Importantly, this study suggests that PjBL can be seamlessly integrated
into other educational approaches to yield even more substantial and impactful results,
thus enhancing the overall effectiveness of research interventions. Equally noteworthy,

Beier et al. (2019) conducted a pivotal study among STEM students, revealing that


participation in at least one project-based course during the first four semesters
profoundly influences their perceptions of STEM skills and the perceived value of
pursuing STEM courses and careers. Furthermore, they found that STEM skills and the
perceived utility of these courses played a pivotal role in moderating the impact of PjBL
on STEM career aspirations. Building upon this foundation, Hanif et al. (2019) conducted
research demonstrating the significant influence of STEM project-based learning on
students’ creativity across various dimensions, including problem resolution, elaboration,
and novelty. As a result of these compelling findings, the researchers advocate
incorporating STEM PjBL as an essential teaching strategy, particularly within the

context of junior secondary school education.

Within the territory of education, the dynamic scene of pedagogical approaches
continually evolves to meet the diverse needs of learners and the demands of a rapidly
changing world. Two approaches, Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Project-Based
Learning (PjBL), have garnered significant attention for their potential to foster

meaningful learning experiences and cultivate essential skills.

A synthesis comparison table (Table 3) has been thoroughly curated to elucidate
the key attributes, principles, and outcomes associated with PBL and PjBL. This table is a
comprehensive resource for educators, researchers, and educational stakeholders,
providing valuable insights into the distinctive features of these approaches, their
alignment with established learning theories, and their demonstrated impacts on learners’
achievements and skills. Through a systematic exploration of PBL and PjBL, this study
aims to understand better their role within the broader spectrum of educational strategies

and their relevance in nurturing the competencies required for success in the 21st century.

In conclusion, Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Project-Based Learning

(PjBL) are two prominent educational approaches that seamlessly align with the
principles and philosophy of design thinking (DT). Within the broader umbrella of design
thinking, PBL emphasizes contextual, constructive, collaborative, and self-directed
learning principles (Wang & Zhao, 2021), mirroring DT's empathetic, iterative, and user-
centric focus. PBL encourages students to tackle real-world problems collaboratively,
enhancing motivation and fostering life skills (Tan, 2021). This resonates with the core

ethos of design thinking, emphasizing empathy, ideation, and iterative problem solving.

On the other hand, PjBL embodies essential design elements such as posing
challenging problems, sustaining inquiry, promoting authenticity, providing student voice
and choice, encouraging reflection, fostering critique and revision, and making the

project work public (Buck Institute for Education, 2019). These elements mirror design


thinking's principles of empathy, ideation, and prototyping, where students actively
investigate real-world problems, construct knowledge, and communicate their ideas,

aligning seamlessly with the design thinking mindset.

Furthermore, both PBL and PjBL are grounded in constructivist and
constructionist learning theories (Csizmadia et al., 2019; Jumaat et al., 2017), which
emphasize hands-on learning, real-world experiences, and the creation of tangible
artifacts—vital elements within the design thinking process. By nurturing critical
thinking, collaboration, and self-directed learning, these approaches empower students to
become active participants in their education, closely resembling the design thinking
approach, which encourages iterative ideation, prototyping, and user-focused problem

solving.

In essence, Problem-Based Learning and Project-Based Learning provide
valuable pathways for students to develop the essential skills and mindsets of design
thinking—empathy, creativity, collaboration, and innovation. Through their alignment
with design thinking principles, PBL and PjBL enable educators to cultivate the next
generation of problem solvers and innovators who are well-prepared to address the
complex challenges of our ever-evolving world (Buck Institute for Education, 2019; Tan,

2021).

Research Constructs
This research section examines several crucial constructs central to the study's
objectives. As the dependent variables, cognitive flexibility, transdisciplinary thinking,

and growth mindset stand at the vanguard of investigation. These constructs have been


selected due to their profound implications for students’ cognitive development and

problem-solving abilities.

As one of the focal points, cognitive flexibility represents a critical aspect of a
student's ability to adapt and reconfigure their thinking processes in response to new
information or changing circumstances. It is pivotal in enhancing problem-solving skills
and creative thinking, essential components of a well-rounded education. By examining
the effects of different teaching approaches on cognitive flexibility, this research aims to
contribute valuable insights into optimizing pedagogical strategies that foster this crucial

cognitive attribute.

Growth mindset, the second dependent variable of this study, pertains to an
individual's belief in their capacity for personal growth and development. It significantly
impacts students’ motivation, persistence, and resilience in facing challenges. By
examining the influence of different teaching approaches on growth mindset, this
research seeks to uncover strategies that empower students to embrace challenges as

learning and personal development opportunities.

Transdisciplinary thinking, another dependent variable under scrutiny, is
increasingly recognized as an indispensable skill in today's interconnected world. This
thinking encourages students to effectively integrate knowledge from diverse disciplines
to address complex real-world challenges. Investigating the impact of various teaching
approaches on transdisciplinary thinking provides a comprehensive understanding of how
educators can nurture students’ ability to tackle multifaceted problems that transcend

traditional disciplinary boundaries.


In addition to these dependent variables, this investigation aimed to see the
moderating effects of academic resilience in relation to the teaching approaches.
Academic resilience is a multifaceted construct encompassing students' ability to
overcome obstacles and setbacks in pursuing educational goals. By investigating how
academic resilience moderates the effects of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) on
cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking, this research aims to
illuminate the underlying mechanisms through which pedagogical interventions can

enhance these critical cognitive skills.

Therefore, this study adopts a comprehensive approach to explore the
sophisticated relationships between teaching approaches, cognitive flexibility,
transdisciplinary thinking, and growth mindset. Investigating these constructs and their
interplay provides educators and policymakers valuable insights into designing effective
educational interventions that foster holistic cognitive development and equip students

with the skills they need to thrive in an ever-evolving world.

Cognitive Flexibility

To make better decisions, one must be able to look at the situation from different
perspectives and analyze it rapidly. Thus, cognitive flexibility is switching between
thinking about two other concepts and thinking about multiple ideas simultaneously. It is
usually described as the executive function. and there are two subcategories of cognitive
flexibility — task switching and cognitive shifting. For instance, most activities require a
person to call upon reserves of personal experience, factual knowledge, and imagination

to address the task at hand. How well a person does this depends on how flexible one can


navigate these three domains, down to cognitive flexibility. Moreover, cognitive
flexibility is a skill that can help a person look at the situation from different perspectives

and eventually make better decisions (Braem & Tobias, 2018).

Some strategies were suggested to improve this skill: first, paying attention to
one’s thoughts. At any given moment, one must pause and reflect on their thoughts.
Being conscious of one’s ideas will enable someone to control the situation better.
Second, by learning something new. When someone do this, they gain new knowledge
that can be used to solve future problems and challenges better. Third, by changing one’s
routine. Sometimes, people get stuck doing things the same way, and a great strategy is to
change your patterns. However, do not forget practices that would nurture cognitive

processes.

As Spiro et al. (1991) defined, cognitive flexibility draws from fundamental
educational theories such as constructivism, social development, and experiential
learning. It encompasses a learner's capacity to construct mental frameworks by
integrating new information into existing schemas, often through social interactions. This
cognitive skill comprises two core components: "Alternatives," which involve perceiving
diverse interpretations of life events and generating multiple solutions to challenging
situations, and "Control," focusing on an internal sense of managing difficulties.
Cognitive flexibility enables learners to embrace diverse perspectives, foster creative
problem solving, and approach obstacles with resilience, contributing to a versatile and

adaptable approach to learning and life.

Furthermore, the cognitive skill of "Alternatives" equips individuals with the

capacity to explore multiple interpretations and responses to life events. It can be likened


to having a mental toolbox filled with various approaches and strategies for addressing
challenges or making decisions. For example, individuals adept at generating alternatives
tend to display greater adaptability and creativity when confronted with complex
problems, as they can envision diverse solutions and viewpoints. Conversely, "Control"
pertains to an individual's perception of agency and an internal locus of control, where
they see difficult circumstances as manageable. This psychological attribute reflects one's
belief in influencing or navigating challenging situations. Those with a strong sense of
control often view setbacks as surmountable and believe they can take action to improve
their circumstances. This internal locus of control can be empowering, associated with
resilience, and indicative of a proactive approach to problem solving. For instance,
individuals with a heightened sense of control tend to regard setbacks as temporary
hurdles and possess the confidence to overcome adversity (Cafias, 2006; Feng et al.,
2020; Ionescu, 2012). These attributes collectively contribute to cognitive and emotional
resilience, enabling individuals to navigate life's challenges with flexibility and
confidence and fostering a mindset that embraces diverse perspectives and solutions

while maintaining a sense of agency and adaptability in the face of adversity.

Recently, cognitive flexibility has been studied among university students, in
general (Sucu & Bedel, 2021), mathematics instruction (Sugilar & Nuraida, 2022), and in

the field of medicine (Terry et al., 2022).

Drawing from a study conducted by Suco and Bedel (2021) involving university
students, it becomes evident that social problem solving is complicatedly linked to and
predicts cognitive flexibility. This illuminates the role of cognitive flexibility in

enhancing problem-solving skills within this demographic of learners. Furthermore,


insights gleaned from the research by Terry et al. (2022) shed light on the moderating
influence of cognitive flexibility in the relationship between one's specialty intention and
program satisfaction. This suggests that individuals who align their intended specialty
with their pursuits may experience heightened satisfaction with their program, even when
encountering the challenges inherent in medical residency. However, a distinct
perspective emerges from the findings of Sugilar and Nuraida (2022), who identified a
subcategory of cognitive flexibility related to open-mindedness about various ideas.
Interestingly, this aspect exhibited a relatively low correlation with lecture outcomes.
Nevertheless, the development of cognitive flexibility as a practical skill to effectively
address problems remains feasible, provided educators employ innovative teaching

approaches within the classroom context.

Hence, cognitive flexibility, a crucial cognitive skill, impacts decision making,
adaptability, and creative problem solving. It involves switching between concepts and
considering multiple ideas. Drawing from educational theories, Table 4 summarizes
cognitive flexibility, its significance, strategies for improvement, theoretical foundation,
core components, and applications. It explores the feasibility of developing cognitive

flexibility as a practical skill.

In conclusion, cognitive flexibility is a fundamental cognitive skill with profound
implications for decision making, problem solving, and adaptability. It encapsulates the
ability to traverse mental backgrounds, shifting between diverse concepts and ideas and
contemplating multiple perspectives simultaneously. This executive function, comprising
two core components — "Alternatives" and "Control," is integral to constructing mental
frameworks by integrating new information, often nurtured through social interactions.
By embracing diverse viewpoints and fostering creative problem solving, cognitive
flexibility empowers individuals to navigate life's challenges with resilience and
adaptability. Several strategies have been proposed to enhance this skill, including
introspection, lifelong learning, and embracing change in routine. The multifaceted
nature of cognitive flexibility draws inspiration from foundational educational theories
like constructivism, social development, and experiential learning. Recent studies further
emphasize its relevance across various domains, from university students to mathematics
and medicine, highlighting its vital role in promoting versatile and adaptable approaches
to learning and life. As individuals nurture cognitive flexibility, they open doors to a
world of possibilities, fostering a mindset that thrives on diverse perspectives and

solutions while maintaining a sense of agency and adaptability in the face of adversity.

Growth mindset

Some people find challenging problems exciting in some scenarios and can be
used as a guidepost for self-improvement. This is called the growth mindset. With this
mindset, people believe abilities can be improved through practice, thus creating a love

for learning. Life becomes an exciting journey for people with a growth mindset and


endless opportunities to figure things out and advance. To develop a growth mindset,
Dweck (2019) said that one should celebrate trying. Teachers should applaud students for
any grade if they study hard in school. Moreover, parents should encourage their children
to develop new skills they are interested in at home. In doing this, children will learn the

skill of learning, which will also help them back in the classroom.

The concept of the growth mindset was built on mindset theory, which explains
underlying conventions about the flexibility of personal qualities. The idea signifies a
social-cognitive approach that stems from goals and goal-oriented behavior and conveys
individual differences in beliefs and values. Mindset theorists believe intelligence affects
motivation, attitude, and behavior; inherent ideas about intelligence can strongly
influence learning motivation. Hence, success results from an underlying mindset; when
students consider that intelligence can be improved (a growth mindset), they value effort,

commitment, and motivation to learn (Kapasi & Pei, 2022).

Moreover, mindset theory is largely believed from a divergent-convergent
thinking process - social-cognitive learning theory by Albert Bandura. This theory
suggests that learning happens in a social situation with a dynamic and shared interaction
of the person, environment, and behavior. Also, behavior is established by four factors:
goals, outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, and sociostructural variables. Goals are plans
to take action and can be envisioned as objectives to execute the behavior (Anderman &

Gray, 2015).

Several studies have used a growth mindset as a pedagogical approach and
intervention to develop a particular ability (independent variable). No studies have

explored growth mindset as a dependent variable affected by a teaching


approach/intervention. As an independent variable, a growth mindset has been proven to
influence students’ self-efficacy and motivation (Rhew et al., 2018), academic

performance (Zintz, 2018), and engagement (Zhao et al., 2021).

In Rhew et al.'s (2018) study involving Grade 8 adolescent special education
students, the introduction of a growth mindset intervention significantly impacted
motivation. However, it did not directly affect self-efficacy. An exciting observation
emerged from this study, highlighting the importance of survey calibration when
assessing self-efficacy, as a miscalibration was identified, potentially leading to
inaccurate outcomes. Conversely, Zintz (2018) provided compelling evidence for the
positive influence of a growth mindset on students! academic performance. This effect
was found to be interconnected with both grit and a growth mindset. Students who
exhibit perseverance in their educational journey often possess grit, which aligns closely
with a growth mindset, particularly when confronted with challenges and adversity.
Realizing the potential benefits of a growth mindset within the school environment
highlights the pivotal role of well-informed and supportive educators who can effectively
implement growth mindset strategies in academic instruction. Lastly, Zhao et al. (2021)
affirmed the profound impact of a growth mindset on students’ engagement, especially
during challenging circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding features
the essential role of a growth mindset in nurturing college students’ learning engagement
during times of adversity. Ultimately, a growth mindset cultivates responsible individuals
who remain open to acquiring new skills, enhancing their employability prospects, and

adapting to the ever-evolving demands of the workforce.


As this study focuses on the components of a growth mindset, several studies
explain that a growth mindset encapsulates (a.) belief in improvement (Yeager & Dweck,
2020), (b.) efforts to emphasize a growth mindset (Claro et al., 2016), (c.) belief in
variance (Burnette et al., 2023), and (d.) determinations not to procrastinate (Ng, 2018).
These components are closely related to the concept of a growth mindset, a belief that
one's abilities and intelligence can be developed and improved through dedication and

hard work, as proposed by Carol Dweck.

One of the fundamental aspects of a growth mindset is the belief in improvement.
Individuals with a growth mindset embrace challenges and setbacks as opportunities for
learning and growth. They perceive their abilities and intelligence as malleable, which
fosters a willingness to put in effort and persist in the face of difficulties, ultimately

leading to improvement over time (Yeager & Dweck, 2020).

Moreover, efforts to emphasize a growth mindset involve intentionally promoting
the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed. This aligns with the core
principles of a growth mindset. When individuals are encouraged to cultivate a growth
mindset. they are more likely to embrace challenges, put in effort, and view failures as
opportunities for learning. Efforts to emphasize a growth mindset can create an
environment where individuals are motivated to develop their skills and abilities (Claro et

al., 2016).

Burnette et al. (2023) explain that belief in variance relates to individuals
acknowledging that people have different starting points and progress at varying rates.
This recognition aligns with a growth mindset by emphasizing that everyone has the

potential to improve, but the starting point may differ. Individuals with a growth mindset


do not compare themselves to others but focus on their progress and development,

making them more resilient in facing challenges.

Lastly, procrastination can hinder growth and learning. Individuals with a growth
mindset tend to approach their goals and challenges proactively. They understand that
delaying efforts can impede improvement. Therefore, the determination not
toprocrastinate is consistent with a growth mindset because it reflects a commitment to
taking action, putting in effort, and continuously working toward improvement (Ng,

2018).

In summary, these four components are interconnected with a growth mindset.
Belief in improvement, efforts to emphasize a growth mindset, belief in variance, and
determination not to procrastinate all contribute to the mindset of continuous
development, fostering resilience, and a commitment to learning and growth (see Table

5).

Table 5


Key Components Related to a Growth Mindset

Components of a
Growth Mindset

Description and Relationship to Growth Mindset

Belief in
Improvement

Individuals with a growth mindset believe that abilities can be
improved with effort and dedication. They view challenges as
opportunities for growth and are willing to persist in facing
setbacks (Yeager & Dweck, 2020).

Efforts to Emphasize
a Growth Mindset

Promoting a growth mindset involves intentionally conveying
that abilities and intelligence are malleable. Encouragement to
cultivate this mindset creates an environment where individuals
are more likely to embrace challenges and view failures as
opportunities for learning and growth (Claro et al., 2016).

Belief in Variance

A growth mindset recognizes that individuals start at different
points and progress at varying rates. It emphasizes personal
development rather than comparison with others, fostering
resilience in the face of challenges (Burnette et al., 2023).

Determination not to
Procrastinate

Procrastination can hinder growth and learning. Individuals
with a growth mindset tend to take proactive steps toward their
goals, understanding the importance of timely action and
consistent effort for continuous improvement (Ng, 2018).

In a nutshell, a growth mindset, characterized by the belief that abilities can be

improved through practice, fuels a passion for learning and self-improvement. Embracing

this perspective involves celebrating efforts in the classroom and beyond. Rooted in

social-cognitive principles and drawing from theorists like Albert Bandura, mindset

theory stresses how beliefs and values influence motivation, attitude, and behavior.

Studies have utilized the growth mindset as an independent variable to impact self-

efficacy, motivation, academic performance, and engagement. The study further explored


key components of a growth mindset, including the belief in improvement, efforts to
emphasize it, recognition of variance, and determination to avoid procrastination, all
contributing to a mindset of continuous development, resilience, and a strong

commitment to learning and growth.

Transdisciplinary Thinking

This cognitive construct thrives on the synergy of interdisciplinary thinking and
the art of forging connections between diverse fields of knowledge. Beyond merely
bridging these disciplinary divides, its fundamental aim lies in enhancing comprehension
across interconnected domains. Rooted in the transdisciplinary approach, this cognitive
skill champions the integration of subject areas, effectively dissolving conventional
boundaries and reshaping education around the meaningful exploration of real-world
challenges. Transdisciplinarity is paramount in education as it empowers students to
weave meaningful connections, harmonizing shared concepts across varied subjects and
translating them into practical applications, thus facilitating a holistic approach to
creative problem solving. Furthermore, in research, transdisciplinarity emerges as a
potent tool for addressing complex societal issues, as it seamlessly intertwines scientific
knowledge with problem-solving methodologies firmly grounded in science (Budwig &
Alexander, 2020). In today's ever-evolving environment, nurturing creative problem
solving skills through transdisciplinarity is essential and the key to unlocking innovative

solutions for the present challenges.

Furthermore, transdisciplinary thinking, viewed as a skill, finds its roots in

constructivist learning theory, wherein learners construct knowledge and understanding


through their experiences. This approach hinges on the premise that learners use their
existing knowledge to create new insights (Shah, 2019). The transdisciplinary skill
encompasses a spectrum of learning approaches within this framework, including
knowledge acquisition, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation,
dialectical thought, and metacognition. These facets collectively equip students with
indispensable abilities that empower them to thrive and adapt across diverse professions,
challenges, and situations. Moreover, a constructivist classroom thrives when knowledge
and authority are jointly shared between educators and learners, with teachers assuming
the role of facilitators in the learning process and learners collaborating in group-based
learning endeavors. This collaborative and constructivist approach fosters an environment

conducive to effective transdisciplinary learning and skill development.

Based on studies on transdisciplinarity as an approach and a skill, most results
lean toward sustainable development (Jurgena et al., 2018; Orozco-Messana et al., 2020;

Tasdemir & Gazo, 2020) and STEM education (Quigley et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2018).

In Tasdemir and Gazo's (2020) study involving college students, integrating a
transdisciplinary perspective into problem-based learning (PBL) course content yielded
significant gains in sustainability awareness, encompassing both the overall context and
individual sustainability pillars. Notably, students exhibited a comprehensive
understanding of modern management techniques and expressed confidence in applying
these acquired skills to real-world challenges within their respective professions upon
graduation. Similarly, Orozco-Messana et al. (2020) accentuated the transformative
impact of the transdisciplinary approach on college students, particularly in nurturing

empathic and systems thinking abilities. This approach focuses on educating future


engineers adept at implementing sustainability principles in practical, built-environment
scenarios and emphasizes problem solving rooted in a transdisciplinary perspective.
Furthermore, Jurgena et al. (2018) emphasized the alignment between the constructivist
learning approach and contemporary trends in sustainable education based on students’
subjective evaluations. In this context, the broader framework in which learners develop a
cognitive interest in natural science subjects at school intertwines with issues surrounding
system sustainability and the application of the transdisciplinary approach. Collectively,
these findings advocate for the potential of transdisciplinarity, both as an approach and a
set of thinking skills, to positively influence students’ perceptions of sustainable
development, especially when integrated into PBL and technology-driven instructional
methods that expose them to real-world challenges. This holistic perspective, involving
multiple viewpoints and problem-solving directions, fosters complex problem solving
abilities and nurtures forward-thinking mindsets among learners—a crucial asset in

today's dynamic work industries.

In alignment with prior research on transdisciplinarity, Quigley et al. (2019)
emphasize the indispensability of the transdisciplinary approach in bridging the STEAM
disciplines to foster a comprehensive and interconnected comprehension. Additionally,
they advocate the implementation of integrative projects centered on authentic, real-life
issues to cultivate transdisciplinary thinking skills among college students, effectively
establishing connections between these disciplines. Moreover, Tan et al. (2022) posit that
indicators like empathy, systems thinking, and metacognitive proficiency are valuable
proxies for evaluating transdisciplinary thinking in future engineering students.

Therefore, by crafting well-structured learning activities, educators can facilitate the


development of a holistic understanding of complex real-world challenges, equipping
learners with the capability to address these complexities by drawing from a rich
reservoir of knowledge and skills spanning both engineering and non-engineering

domains.

Several studies have mentioned that transdisciplinary thinking consists of three
components — integrative (Creed et al., 2019), collaborative (Finch et al., 2021), and

inquiry-driven (Gibbs, 2017).

According to Creed et al. (2019), transdisciplinary thinking embodies an
integrative perspective. It encourages individuals to combine insights, methods, and
concepts from diverse disciplines to understand complex issues comprehensively. In this
context, integrative thinking implies the ability to synthesize and amalgamate knowledge
effectively and approaches from various fields to address multifaceted challenges. By
integrating insights from multiple disciplines, transdisciplinary thinkers can generate
holistic solutions considering the interconnectedness of numerous factors, fostering a

deeper comprehension of the issue.

In addition, Finch et al. (2021) mentioned that collaboration is a fundamental
aspect of transdisciplinary thinking. It point out the importance of engaging with experts
and stakeholders from various fields to tackle complex problems collectively.
Transdisciplinary thinkers recognize that no single discipline possesses all the answers to
complicated issues. Therefore, they actively seek collaborative opportunities. working
alongside individuals with diverse expertise and perspectives. Through collaboration,
transdisciplinary thinkers can access a broader pool of knowledge, fostering a richer and

more well-rounded approach to problem solving.


Moreover, inquiry-driven thinking is also a core component of transdisciplinary
approaches. It involves continuously questioning, exploring, and investigating complex
phenomena. Transdisciplinary thinkers are inherently curious and driven by a thirst for
knowledge. They approach problems with a sense of inquiry, delving deeply into various
aspects to uncover hidden connections and new insights. This investigative mindset
propels them to explore multiple dimensions of an issue, encouraging a more profound

understanding that transcends disciplinary boundaries (Gibbs, 2017).

Remarkably, these sources highlight the complex nature of transdisciplinary
thinking and its multifaceted approach to addressing complex challenges. One
emphasizes the integrative aspect of transdisciplinary thinking, wherein individuals are
encouraged to amalgamate insights and methods from diverse disciplines, ultimately
fostering a more profound comprehension of complex issues. Likewise, collaboration
emerges as a pivotal element, stressing the need for experts and stakeholders from
various fields to tackle difficult problems collectively. This collaborative ethos
acknowledges that no single discipline possesses all-encompassing solutions. Finally, the
inquiry-driven approach features the continuous process of questioning and exploration
that characterizes transdisciplinary thinkers. Their innate curiosity and dedication to
probing various dimensions of an issue enhance their understanding, transcending
disciplinary boundaries. Together, these attributes showcase the comprehensive and
multifaceted nature of transdisciplinary thinking, making it a potent framework for

addressing the complexities of contemporary challenges in an interconnected world.

Following a comprehensive exploration of the existing academic environment, it
is notable that there is a noticeable gap in biology education research. Specifically, no
prior studies have explored the elaborate interplay between cognitive flexibility,
transdisciplinary thinking, and growth mindset within biology education. Recognizing
this significant void, the current endeavor is a pioneering initiative to illuminate the
potential connections and synergies among these vital cognitive and psychological
constructs. At its core, this study investigates how Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE) may catalyze the development and enhancement of these essential skills among

biology learners.

The rationale behind this exploration is underpinned by the growing recognition
that biology education extends far beyond the mere transmission of facts and theories. It
is increasingly imperative to equip biology learners with a versatile set of cognitive,
creative, and problem-solving skills that empower them to navigate the ever-evolving
setting of biological sciences effectively. Within this context, cognitive flexibility
emerges as a crucial cognitive skill, enabling individuals to adapt, innovate, and thrive
amidst complex and dynamic biological phenomena. Transdisciplinary thinking, on the
other hand, beckons as a holistic approach that encourages students to transcend the
confines of traditional disciplinary boundaries, fostering a more comprehensive
understanding of the elaborate interplay between biology and other domains. Lastly, the
growth mindset, focusing on cultivating resilience, embracing challenges, and fostering a
love for continuous learning, emerges as a psychological cornerstone in nurturing biology

learners’ potential.


This study's novelty lies in exploring how the DBE can serve as a potent conduit
for cultivating cognitive flexibility, transdisciplinary thinking, and a growth mindset
among biology students. By examining the potential synergies between these elements,
this research endeavors to shed light on innovative pedagogical approaches that can equip
the next generation of biologists with not only a profound understanding of the life
sciences but also the intellectual agility, adaptability, and passion for lifelong learning
that are increasingly vital in today's multifaceted world. Thus, this study embarks on a
pioneering journey, poised to expand the horizons of biology education and open new
vistas of understanding at the intersection of cognitive development, pedagogical

innovation, and psychological growth.

Academic Resilience as a Moderating Variable

Contemporary students encounter many challenges, with one of the prominent
hurdles being the need to adapt to shifting learning modalities, often precipitated by
ongoing global crises. In this dynamic educational setting, evaluating and understanding
students’ academic resilience becomes increasingly crucial. This foundational assessment
empowers educators to provide targeted support, enabling students to excel academically

and unlock their full potential in the classroom.

Various recent studies in medical and behavioral sciences explored the
moderating role of academic resilience in different affective or behavioral attributes of
learners, such as academic achievement (Bahrami et al., 2017; Choo & Prihadi, 2019;

Fang et al., 2019; Safaee et al., 2019), competence (Akbari et al., 2014; Hayat et al.,


2021; Liu & Platow, 2020; Turan, 2021), and motivation (Jowkar et al., 2014; Romano et

al., 2021; Shakarami et al., 2018).

Fang et al.'s (2019) research highlights the pivotal role of academic resilience as a
moderating factor in students' achievement. Their findings reveal that teachers’ guidance
holds greater significance in bolstering academic resilience among the various forms of
support, highlighting the profound influence educators wield in this regard. This
sentiment is echoed by Safee et al. (2019), who corroborate that social support, a
component of academic resilience, positively impacts students’ academic performance.
These insights collectively emphasize the potential of diverse stakeholders, including
teachers and peers, to contribute to students’ enhanced academic outcomes.
Consequently, it is imperative to implement strategic measures that harness the positive

effects of these influential factors.

Furthermore, Bahrami et al. (2017) shed light on the sophisticated interplay
between the learning environment, academic burnout, and academic resilience. Their
research illuminates a dual relationship: the learning environment indirectly affects
burnout while directly influencing academic resilience. This revelation highlights the
significance of crafting conducive learning environments that foster academic resilience
to mitigate burnout and enhance achievement. Lastly, Choo and Prihadi (2019)
corroborate the moderating role of academic resilience in students’ performance,
specifically through perfectionistic strivings and concerns. Despite partial mediation,
their results underline that academic resilience continues to account for a meaningful

portion of the variance in academic performance. This reinforces the importance of


nurturing academic resilience as an integral component in promoting students’ overall

achievement.

Evidently, academic resilience emerges as a significant mediator in learners’
competence across various contexts. Notably, Akbahri et al. (2014) shed light on its
comprehensive moderating role in the relationship between family conversation
orientation and test anxiety. This suggests that families engage in conversation-oriented
practices to fortify their children's resilience, subsequently reducing test anxiety levels.
Hayat et al. (2021) further stressed the moderating potential of academic resilience,
particularly in the interplay between self-efficacy and test anxiety. Practical implications
of these findings highlight the importance of identifying at-risk students and
implementing targeted interventions that emphasize the cultivation of resilience and self-
efficacy, offering a valuable strategy for mitigating and preventing stress among students.
In line with these insights, Akbahri et al. (2014) concurred with Turan (2021) and Hayat
et al. (2021), emphasizing the enduring moderating impact of academic resilience in the
relationship between social-emotional learning competencies and life satisfaction. This
suggests that incorporating activities grounded in academic resilience within Social and
Emotional Learning (SEL) programs could enhance overall life quality, fostering
happiness, well-being, and satisfaction. Lastly, Liu and Platow (2020) corroborated the
moderating roles of academic resilience in learners’ competence. Their results provide
valuable insights into how broader social-ideological beliefs about the world can
influence individual self-construals, ultimately shaping personal determination when

confronted with adversity. These multifaceted findings collectively highlight the pivotal


role of academic resilience in diverse contexts and stress its potential for promoting

positive outcomes in the face of academic and life challenges.

Indeed, academic resilience emerges as a potent mediator significantly impacting
students' motivation. Romano et al. (2021) elucidated the close relationship between
academic resilience and teacher-emotional support linked to school engagement.
Furthermore, teacher emotional support was identified as a partial mediator in the
complex relationship between academic resilience and school engagement. This
emphasizes the importance of nurturing personal and contextual resources within the
school environment to foster students’ well-being. Additionally, it is imperative to
recognize that academic resilience is pivotal as an affective outcome, profoundly
influencing students’ goal orientation and achievement. As established by Jowkar et al.
(2014), students who adopt a mastery orientation or demonstrate intrinsic motivation tend

to exhibit higher levels of self-assurance and achieve superior academic performance.

Furthermore, Sharakami et al. (2018) suggest that academic resilience can be a
moderating bridge connecting familial emotional factors with academic engagement.
Thus, it can be inferred that the classroom's socio-mental climate and the emotional
dynamics within the family sphere synergistically bolster academic resilience, with the
subsequent enhancement of academic resilience leading to a notable uptick in academic
motivation. These multifaceted insights emphasize the elaborate interplay between
academic resilience, motivational factors, and the broader educational environment,

underscoring the multidimensional nature of student success.

Upon conducting a comprehensive review of the existing literature that explores

into the complicated moderating roles of academic resilience across diverse cognitive and


behavioral domains among learners, it has come to light that a notable research gap
exists. Specifically, there is an absence of empirical investigation concerning the
potential moderating influence of academic resilience in the context of the independent
and dependent variables under scrutiny in the present study. As such, this research seeks
to fill this void by systematically exploring whether academic resilience emerges as a
mediator variable within the Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) framework and the
suite of skills under investigation, encompassing cognitive flexibility, transdisciplinary
thinking, and growth mindset. This pioneering study endeavors to explain the
complicated interplay between these educational components and academic resilience,
unveiling potential pathways through which the latter may exert its moderating influence,

ultimately enriching understanding of the dynamics at play in biology education.

Theoretical Framework

Design thinking, a dynamic problem solving approach deeply rooted in diverse
disciplines, has become an innovative methodology for addressing complex challenges
and fostering creative solutions. Drawing from fields as varied as psychology,
engineering, education, and business, design thinking emphasizes empathy, user-
centricity, and iterative prototyping to arrive at practical, human-centered outcomes. As
organizations increasingly recognize the need for adaptable and inventive problem
solvers, design thinking has emerged as a versatile framework capable of driving
innovation, improving processes, and enhancing user experiences. In this theoretical
framework, this study explores the foundational principles and theories underpinning

design thinking, exploring its multifaceted nature and relevance as an enabler of


cognitive and behavioral transformation. By understanding the theoretical underpinnings
of design thinking, we aim to elucidate its potential as this investigation seeks to uncover
the role of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) in cultivating cognitive flexibility,
growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking among learners. Also, this research tries to
understand how academic resilience moderates the effects of DBE on the mentioned

skills being studied.

Guided by the design thinking process, synthesizing distinctive elements from
two pedagogical approaches culminates in creating an innovative teaching methodology
poised to influence the study's dependent variable. Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE) has paved the way for an array of evolving and continuously evolving learning
opportunities that remain a focal point of research interest. In this pursuit, it is pertinent
to acknowledge the foundational components of Problem-Based Learning (PBL)
elucidated by Hmelo-Silver and Eberbach (2012), which constitute essential elements in
achieving pedagogical objectives. These encompass the sophisticated PBL tutorial
process, facilitation techniques, problem identification and definition, small-group
collaborative dynamics, self-directed learning strategies, and post-problem reflection.
Furthermore, it is imperative to underline that DBE's distinct attributes find their
theoretical grounding in cognitive information processing, social constructivism, and
social constructionism, theories that significantly inform its design and implementation.
These theories collectively contribute to the pedagogical foundation upon which DBE
operates, enriching the educational environment with innovative approaches to enhance

learner outcomes.


Cognitive information processing underpins the Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE) framework by orchestrating three pivotal elements: information stores, cognitive
processes, and executive cognition. Within this paradigm, learners’ prior knowledge and
experiential reservoirs are the foundation for information stores. This cognitive
architecture engages in a dynamic interplay involving the encoding and retrieval of stored
knowledge, thereby facilitating the assimilation and accommodation of novel
information—the very essence of cognitive processes. The infusion of pedagogical
finesse, often through teacher facilitation, empathy during problem identification, and
collaborative brainstorming within small groups, catalyzes this cognitive metamorphosis.
Once these cognitive alchemies are set in motion, the processed information finds its
apotheosis in the tangible form of authentic prototype creation, a hallmark of DBE
pedagogy. Beyond immediate application, the transferred and refined knowledge assumes
a broader role in the cognitive domain, serving as the cornerstone for restructuring,
existing mental representations, thus equipping learners to confront future challenges
with a more sophisticated cognitive toolkit (Celik6z et al., 2019). This cognitive
framework encapsulates the essence of DBE, fostering a dynamic and holistic approach

to knowledge acquisition and application.

Furthermore, the theoretical framework of social constructivism lends robust
support to four pivotal elements that constitute the bedrock of Design-Based Biology
Education (DBE) as an instructional approach: knowledge, learning, motivation, and
instruction. Within the DBE context, knowledge is not an isolated entity but a product of
social construction. Since DBE problems are rooted in real-life scenarios and necessitate

social interactions for resolution, knowledge acquisition becomes an inherently social


endeavor. When empathizing in DBE, this dynamic social interaction is multifaceted,
encompassing crucial bidirectional exchanges between the teacher and students,
interactions among students, and interactions between students and their broader
community environment. These collaborative exchanges serve as the crucible within
which new information is assimilated and accommodated, embodying the essence of the
learning process. Motivation, a cornerstone of effective education, assumes a dual
character within the DBE framework, encompassing intrinsic and extrinsic facets. The
enduring commitment of students to the DBE journey hinges upon their intrinsic
motivation and the belief in the realization of meaningful outcomes. Herein, facilitators
are tasked with nurturing and sustaining students’ intrinsic motivation, fostering a culture

of mastery orientation.

Similarly, DBE thrives on the synergistic interplay of collaboration and effective
teacher facilitation in instruction. These complementary elements are instrumental in the
seamless implementation of DBE, ensuring that the educational journey unfolds as an
engaging and transformative experience (Anderson & Johnston, 2016). In essence, the
theoretical underpinnings of social constructivism provide an invaluable scaffolding for

DBE, harmonizing the obscure interplay of these fundamental components.

Furthermore, scaffolding emerges as an indispensable cornerstone in Design-
Based Biology Education (DBE), serving as a guiding force that propels students toward
deeper cognitive engagement and cultivates the art of questioning essential for fostering a
cognitive apprenticeship. This pedagogical practice, integral to effective learning

facilitation, finds its roots within the rich tapestry of Vygotsky's Sociocultural learning


theory. Vygotsky's framework delineates four distinct categories of scaffolding, each

possessing a unique and potent role in shaping the learning journey:

1) Conceptual scaffolds, the first category, influence learners by steering them
toward critical considerations and guiding their exploration of key concepts.

2) Metacognitive scaffolds, the second facet, empower learners to review and assess
their knowledge, reducing the cognitive load associated with mental processing.

3) Procedural scaffolds, the third dimension, equip learners with various tools to
navigate complex processes effectively, including flowcharts, site maps, and
complicated graphical representations.

4) Strategic scaffolds, the fourth category, offer learners alternative pathways for
tackling a given task, streamlining the problem-solving process by distilling it into

its core elements.

In essence, teachers harness the power of scaffolding to orchestrate an educational
symphony wherein students engage in creative, human-centered problem solving
anchored firmly within disciplinary frameworks and strategic methodologies. As adept
facilitators, teachers employ scaffolding to illuminate the task's complex processes and
essential nuances, fostering a climate that nurtures students’ analytical thinking and
deepens their comprehension of the overarching process (Haruehansawasin &

Kiattikomol, 2018). Figure 1 illustrates the theoretical framework of DBE research.

The current research adopts a well-structured framework that aligns with the

tenets of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE). In navigating the DBE model, the

study is anchored in a multifaceted approach that prioritizes creative and human-centered

problem solving as its cornerstone. Recognizing the inherent synergy between DBE and

the design thinking process for addressing multifaceted, real-world challenges, this

research embraces a structured iteration of five key steps:



1) Empathy, where a profound understanding of the problem's human dimension is
cultivated.

2) Define, wherein the problem is thoroughly framed and distilled into its core
components.

3) Ideate, fostering a climate of boundless creativity and ideation to explore diverse
solutions.

4) Prototype, giving form and substance to the envisioned solutions for testing and
refinement.

5) Test, subjecting the prototypes to rigorous examination to ascertain their efficacy

and further iteratively enhance them.

Moreover, in alignment with DBE’s intrinsic philosophy as a student-centered
pedagogical approach. this study accords paramount significance to the teacher's role as a
facilitator. Rather than being the sole knowledge repository, the teacher works with
students to equip them with the information and skills for academic success and holistic
development. This collaborative and learner-centric approach is highlighted by the
insights of Balakrishnan (2022) and Magistretti et al. (2022). further accentuating the

study's robust theoretical foundation.

Furthermore, this research endeavor will draw upon the rich theoretical
foundations underpinning Design-Based Biology Education (DBE). Strategic scaffolds,
thoughtfully crafted guide questions, and purposeful scripts intertwined with empathetic
engagement will emerge as essential components throughout the implementation phase.

These elements align seamlessly with the core tenets of the design thinking process,


strategically employed to nurture the authentic creation of prototypes aimed at creatively

addressing complex real-world challenges.

It is essential to note that the absence of rigorous empirical investigations within
the existing body of research regarding DBE point out the novelty and significance of this
study. Furthermore, the current research is accentuated by the shortage of comprehensive
inquiries probing the holistic impact of DBE on critical attributes such as cognitive
flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. As such, the principal
objective of this study is to bridge this research gap by carefully examining whether
DBE, as an innovative pedagogical approach, significantly influences the aforementioned
dependent variables. Figure 2 elucidates the schematic representation of the DBE
framework adopted in this study, serving as a visual guide to its core components and

interrelated dynamics.

Moreover, in the DBE framework of this study (Figure 2), the pedagogical
guidance is structured around fundamental principles like the design thinking process,

scaffolding, and facilitation of the learning journey.

1. Pedagogical Guides
Design Thinking Process: DBE emphasizes applying the design thinking process,
guiding students through stages like empathizing with users, defining problems,
brainstorming ideas, prototyping solutions, and testing iterations. This structured
approach encourages students to tackle real-world challenges with creativity and
critical thinking.
Scaffolding: Educators in DBE provide scaffolding by breaking down complex

tasks into manageable steps and offering support and resources along the way.


This gradually helps students develop their skills and confidence, ensuring they
can engage effectively with the design process.

Facilitation of the Learning Process: The teacher, the facilitator, plays a crucial
role in DBE by creating a conducive learning environment. They encourage
collaboration, experimentation, and reflection, allowing students to take
ownership of their learning while providing guidance and feedback as needed.
Learning Component:

Collaboration Among Students: Collaboration is a cornerstone of DBE, as
students work together in teams to address design challenges. By working
collaboratively, students learn to communicate effectively, leverage diverse
perspectives, and contribute meaningfully to shared goals, fostering a sense of
collective ownership and responsibility.

Real-World Issue Integration: Integrating real-world issues into the learning
component ensures students’ efforts have tangible relevance and impact. Whether
it's addressing environmental sustainability, social justice, healthcare access, or
economic inequality, students are motivated by the opportunity to make a
difference in the world around them. This authentic context inspires deeper
engagement and fosters a sense of civic responsibility among students.
Learning Evidence:

Product or Project: In DBE, student learning is evidenced by creating tangible
products or projects. These artifacts showcase students’ application of design

thinking principles and ability to solve problems creatively. Whether it's a


physical prototype, a digital design, or a multimedia presentation, the final

product is a testament to students’ learning journey and achievements.

The DBE framework thus provides a structured approach to integrating design
thinking into education, with pedagogical guidance to support educators, collaborative
learning experiences for students, and tangible products or projects as evidence of

learning outcomes.

In addition to delineating the theoretical framework that underpins Design-Based
Biology Education (DBE), it is equally imperative to elucidate the array of research
methodologies employed by scholars in the field. To this end, the researcher conducted
an exhaustive review of prevalent research methodologies commonly harnessed within
the DBE domain. In pursuing this objective, the literature was scrutinized to
comprehensively analyze extant studies, with particular emphasis on their research
designs, sample characteristics, data collection procedures, and analytical methodologies

in the context of DBE (Angelle, 2018).

The predominant research designs frequently employed in DBE research
encompass both descriptive and experimental methodologies. These approaches have
predominantly found application in tertiary education settings and professional
development programs tailored for educators. Consequently, the focal demographic of
study participants often comprises college students and in-service teachers. However,
DBE implementation remains a relatively uncharted territory within secondary education,
spanning both junior and senior high schools. Furthermore, it is pertinent to highlight that
utilizing mixed methods research designs in the DBE research setting remains relatively
infrequent. As for data collection, DBE research encompasses three primary categories:
process data, which is collected throughout DBE implementation and captures the
unfolding of each DBE session; outcome data, which seeks to demonstrate the efficacy of
DBE in enhancing learning outcomes and includes standardized tests, reliable and valid
scales, subject grades, and educational artifacts; and miscellaneous data, which
encompasses information garnered from interviews, focus group discussions, peer

assessments, and various forms of observational data. Regarding quantitative data


analysis, researchers frequently resort to descriptive and inferential statistical methods
such as t-tests, Pearson product-moment correlations, and analyses of variance and
covariance. Conversely, qualitative data is subject to meticulous analysis through content
and thematic approaches (Eliyawati et al., 2020; Garmendia et al., 2021; Halim, 2013;
Ibrahim & Abd.; Jamaluddin et al., 2018; Latada & Kassim, 2017; Wan Husin et al.,

2016).

The current research employs a comprehensive mixed methods approach that
integrates quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Within this framework, a quasi-
experimental pretest-posttest design is the chosen modality for the quantitative facet. In
contrast, qualitative data are gathered from various sources, including focus group
discussions, semi-structured interviews, students’ reflective journals, and observational
records. The study unfolds within classroom and laboratory settings, focusing on three
distinct and heterogeneous groups. Among these groups, one serves as a control group,
while the remaining two function as experimental groups, each subjected to a particular
intervention. The data to be amassed encompass process, miscellaneous, and outcome
data. However, the predominant emphasis lies on outcome data due to the expansive
nature of the research design, which seeks to ascertain the effects of the Design-Based
Biology Education (DBE) approach on the variables of interest, utilizing scales
developed by the researcher. Process data are procured by thoroughly examining learners’

journal entries and scrutinizing educational artifacts.

In contrast, miscellaneous data are harvested from the rich sources of focus group
discussions and diligent observations. These diverse forms of data, including process and

various categories, serve as vital means of triangulation, fostering a more comprehensive


understanding and validation of the results derived from the outcome data. A dual-
pronged approach is adopted in data analysis, encompassing both descriptive and
inferential statistical analyses, ensuring a multifaceted and rigorous exploration of the

research questions.

The pedagogical model of Design-Based Education (DBE) has been enriched by
various instrumental tools and strategies, as Garmendia et al. (2021) highlighted. Within
this educational framework, the accentuation falls on small group collaboration, a pivotal
component in guiding learners through the sophisticated terrain of the design thinking
process. Concurrently, scaffolds are deftly employed to ensure that the educational
experience remains firmly rooted in a student-centered paradigm. These scaffolds play a
multifaceted role. facilitating the acquisition and processing of information and the
seamless transfer of knowledge. Furthermore, they are essential for nurturing inquiry-
based learning, propelling students toward a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
A structured approach has been adopted to orchestrate effective small-group
collaboration, wherein students within each group assume distinct yet interrelated roles.
These rotating roles are carefully designed to cultivate a culture of high-quality
cooperation, ensuring that the group's collective efforts culminate in a comprehensive and
well-rounded exploration of the subject matter. Table 7 serves as a compendium, briefly
outlining the roles and corresponding responsibilities bestowed upon each learner within
this dynamic educational milieu, drawing insights from the work of Urrutia-Aguilar et al.
(2016). This approach not only stresses the significance of collective knowledge
construction but also aligns seamlessly with the principles of DBE, fostering an

environment where students actively engage in the collaborative pursuit of knowledge.

Research Gaps Addressed by the Study

The environment of educational research is inherently dynamic, continuously

evolving to explore innovative pedagogical approaches. Within this context, Design-

Based Biology Education (DBE) has emerged as a distinctive approach, although its

implementation and characteristics vary considerably across studies. This divergence

stems from factors such as the stringency of educational standards, the duration of

implementation, the emphasis on specific learning stages, and the scope of the learning


unit under consideration. A salient feature of DBE is its protracted implementation
period, which allows learners to examine deeply into the subject matter, culminating in
developing a final prototype with the potential for real-world impact. This extended
engagement necessitates collaborative efforts, as Csizmadia et al. (2019) highlighted. In
stark contrast, Problem-Based Learning (PBL) focuses on the 'how' of problem solving,
emphasizing the process rather than the duration. It offers a more flexible timeframe and
does not invariably mandate collaborative endeavors, as illuminated by the insights of

Ramadhani et al. (2019).

Furthermore, it is worth noting that the implementation of DBE has
predominantly targets college students. This strategic choice is underpinned by the
overarching goal of equipping learners with the essential soft skills requisite for success
in the contemporary professional setting, as elucidated by the research of Eliyawati et al.
(2020). In essence, DBE serves as a crucible for cultivating skills and competencies that
resonate with the demands of the modern workforce. Consequently, the diversity in DBE
implementation point out the adaptability and versatility of this pedagogical approach as

it continues to evolve and find its niche in education.

Furthermore, in the current study, the utilization of DEB will focus mainly on its
strengths. In doing this, the teacher-researcher will ensure that the implementation is task-
driven and that the teacher will provide student-centered instruction with scaffolding and
guided-inquiry-influenced learning activities to promote deeper learning of biology
concepts. Likewise, collaboration among learners will be enabled, and each member of
small groups in the classroom will play rotating roles to foster a sense of responsibility.

Also, constructed prototypes will be assessed using analytic rubrics to lessen the


subjectivity in the assessment. Little is established upon analyzing existing literature

about this implementation design in DBE.

In the expansive territory of educational research, existing studies have searched
into the multifaceted effects of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE). These
explorations have traversed the domains of critical thinking, interdisciplinary aptitude,
collaboration, self-efficacy, perseverance, and problem solving. However, the current
study seeks to chart a unique trajectory by examining the transformative potential of DBE
on the dimensions of cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking.
These facets constitute the bedrock of technical and analytical skills, shaping the
panorama of executive functions and metacognitive abilities. Remarkably, the contours of
this particular skill set, within the context of DBE, remain largely uncharted territory,
representing a noteworthy research gap. To the best of the researcher's knowledge, the
elaborate interplay between DBE and the cultivation of cognitive flexibility, a growth
mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking has not yet been scrutinized in the extant

literature.

In this pursuit, the study endeavors to shed light on this unexplored terrain,
unraveling the potential nexus between transdisciplinary thinking, cognitive flexibility,
and growth mindset. Transdisciplinary thinking, recognized as a skill capable of forging
connections across disparate disciplines, stands at the epicenter of this inquiry. As
Orozco-Messana et al. (2020) pointed out, the DBE environment is an incubator for
honing transdisciplinary thinking skills. This synergistic amalgamation of pedagogical
approaches enhances comprehension across different domains and paves the way for a

deeper understanding of diverse subjects.


Crucially, the implications of transdisciplinary thinking extend beyond the
boundaries of mere knowledge acquisition. They hold the key to unlocking a treasure
trove of soft skills and cognitive abilities among learners, which, in turn, could
potentially serve as precursors to academic excellence. Therefore, the emergence of this
uncharted territory underlines the pressing need for further exploration, ushering in an era
of research that seeks to unravel the complex relationship between transdisciplinary
thinking, cognitive flexibility, and a growth mindset in DBE secondary school
classrooms. This pursuit promises to contribute invaluable insights into the dynamic
environment of educational innovation and its manifold impacts on learners' cognitive

and behavioral skills.

The scope of this research inquiry finds its origins in a thorough examination of
existing literature. A conspicuous gap emerged from this meticulous review - a paucity of
investigations into the effects of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) within the
domain of secondary school biology classrooms. Historically, DBE research has
predominantly set its sights on elevating college students’ cognitive prowess and
academic achievements. Simultaneously, it has embarked on journeys to empower in-
service teachers with enhanced pedagogical acumen through immersive training and

workshops.

Nevertheless, an intriguing void awaits exploration that tantalizingly beckons the
curious researcher. This chasm centers on the untapped potential of DBE as an innovative
conduit for addressing the complexities of real-world problems with a creative flair.

Within this intersection, the present study is poised to make its mark. venturing into


uncharted territory where DBE serves as a catalyst for nurturing 21st-century skills

among learners.

The triad of cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking
forms the crux of this transformative journey. These skills are not merely abstract
concepts but tangible cornerstones of academic and professional success in the
contemporary setting. The infusion of DBE practices and their pivotal role in cultivating
these skills becomes indispensable. It marks the transition from traditional pedagogical
approaches to a dynamic, learner-centric paradigm that equips students with the

understanding to grapple with multifaceted challenges innovatively.

In essence, this research endeavor aspires to bridge the existing chasm in DBE
literature by pioneering an exploration of its potential impact in secondary school biology
classrooms. By unveiling the hitherto uncharted territory of DBE's influence on cognitive
flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking, this study aims to contribute
substantively to the burgeoning discourse on innovative educational paradigms and the
holistic development of learners in the 21st century. Amidst the extensive academic
research, the influential role of academic resilience shines as a beacon in the educational
environment. Through its complicated web of direct and indirect pathways, this skill
profoundly impacts critical dimensions of a student's learning journey, including
motivation, competence, and achievement. However, an intriguing research gap emerges
in the scarcity of investigations into the moderating effects of academic resilience on the
variables central to this study. As the researcher navigates this uncharted terrain, the
investigator embarks on unveiling the complex relationships between academic

resilience, motivation, competence, and achievement. This journey promises to deepen


the researcher’s comprehension of resilience and offer insights that can empower

educators and learners in dynamic education.

In principle, this research endeavor stands as a bridge, spanning the gaps
accurately unearthed through exhaustive literature exploration to enhance the educational
surroundings. At its heart lies an innovative pedagogical approach, Design-Based
Biology Education (DBE), which harnesses the power of the design thinking process to
unravel the complexities of authentic, multifaceted problems. Empathy becomes a pivotal
beacon within this framework, illuminating pathways for learners to engage deeply and
comprehensively with complex scientific issues from many perspectives. This study
carries the torch of inquiry, embarking on a journey to illuminate the impact of DBE
teaching methodologies on three essential facets of learning: cognitive flexibility, growth
mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. Furthermore, it ventures into uncharted territory,
exploring the moderating effects of academic resilience on these pivotal variables. Lastly,
in its pursuit of knowledge, this research unveils the predictive prowess of
transdisciplinary thinking, shedding light on its role in shaping cognitive flexibility and
growth mindset. In the tapestry of education, this study's threads are poised to weave a
narrative of empowerment, innovation. and holistic learning, illuminating a path forward

for educators and learners alike.

Table 8 summarizes the research gaps to be addressed in the present study. These
research gaps collectively form the foundation of the present study, contributing to the
ongoing discourse on innovative pedagogical approaches and their impact on learners’

cognitive and behavioral development within the evolving education scenery.

Synthesis

Since the inception of design thinking several decades ago, its primary objective
has consistently been enhancing learners’ cognitive and behavioral skills when employed
as individual teaching methodologies. Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), an
innovative educational approach, emerged to cultivate soft skills among college students
and foster professional development among educators. However, due to certain
limitations and its relatively uncharted terrain, DBE has piqued the research interest in
the current study. Furthermore, this research points out the necessity for continued

exploration of DBE, as it raises several considerations warranting further investigation.

Firstly, DBE exhibits strengths and weaknesses, and to harness its full potential, it
is imperative to leverage the strengths while mitigating its limitations to optimize
learning outcomes. An extensive literature review reveals that one of the strengths of
DBE lies in its capacity to enable learners to engage in high-level cognitive processes
through project creation (Pawson et al., 2019). Creating an authentic prototype to address
complex problems necessitates a creative problem solving approach, which can be
cultivated through the design thinking process. This process, rooted in empathy, equips
learners to gain a deeper understanding of problems, enabling them to employ higher-
order thinking skills. However, it's worth noting that while creative problem solving has
been explored in college education as a standalone approach, there is limited research on
DBE within primary and secondary education as an integrated approach. Therefore, this
study seeks to investigate the impact of DBE on secondary school biology classes,

bridging this research gap (Noel & Liu, 2017).


Secondly, global assessments have consistently ranked the Philippines at the
lower end of educational performance. Addressing this issue requires fostering a societal
appreciation for outward-looking perspectives in teaching and learning (Orbeta Jr. et al.,
2020). With its unique qualities, DBE offers a promising avenue to tackle this challenge.
This study recognizes that the foundation for achieving this lies in developing specific
skills, with cognitive flexibility, a growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking at the
forefront. Yet, there has been limited exploration of these constructs within the context of
DBE. To fully develop these skills, integrated problem solving approaches and promoting
high-level cognitive transfer are essential (Orozco-Messana et al., 2020). DBE presents

an opportunity to realize this goal.

Furthermore, as an emerging educational approach, this research investigates the
moderating effects of academic resilience on the positive outcomes of the DBE teaching
approach across various dependent variables. While the moderating role of academic
resilience is a well-explored topic about other skills, such as competence, motivation, and
academic performance, investigating its potential moderating effects on the variables

under consideration in this study is particularly significant.

Moreover, given the relative novelty of DBE, several limitations exist within the
current body of research, presenting numerous avenues for further investigation.
Therefore, this research blueprint is crafted in response to existing studies’ limitations to
scrutinize the DBE approach's effects on students’ cognitive flexibility, growth mindset,
and transdisciplinary thinking within the context of biology education. Additionally, the

study explores the predictive power of transdisciplinary thinking on cognitive flexibility


and growth mindset, contributing to a deeper understanding of this emerging field of

educational innovation.

In sum, this research stands at the intersection of educational innovation and
pedagogical exploration, seeking to expand understanding of the multifaceted dynamics
of DBE and its potential to enhance learners’ cognitive, behavioral, and metacognitive
skills. By addressing the identified research gaps and building upon the existing body of
knowledge, this study aspires to provide valuable insights into educational practices and
contribute to the holistic development of students in the ever-evolving environment of

education.

Conceptual Framework

The primary focus of this research centered on a comprehensive examination of
the impact of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) on students' cognitive flexibility,
growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking within the domain of biology.
Additionally, the study examined whether transdisciplinary thinking can predict students'
cognitive flexibility and growth mindset. Moreover, the research extended its exploration
to encompass the elaborate moderating effects of academic resilience within the context
of DBE and its influence on the various dependent variables of interest. The study's
conceptual framework, illustrated in Figure 3, visually represents these key components
of the present study’s conceptual framework, offering a holistic perspective on the

complex relationships under investigation.

This research encompassed three groups, each engaging with a particular
pedagogical approach. Among these groups, the experimental clusters represented the

focal point, with one undergoing Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) and the other


Problem-Based Learning (PBL), the latter excluding the empathizing phase. Both
experimental groups adhered to a structured problem solving process comprising five
integral steps. In the case of DBE, these stages encompass empathy, definition, ideation,
prototyping, and testing. Moreover, PBL involved a five-step process that entails 1)
acquiring information about the problem scenario, 2) delineating the problem by
identifying key focus areas, 3) amassing potential solutions to address the problem, 4)
testing the viability of these solutions through product creation, and 5) engaging in

reflection and assessment to inform future improvements.

To facilitate an enriched learning experience within the experimental groups, an
array of scaffolding techniques and facilitating strategies were thoughtfully implemented.
These included the utilization of inquiry-initiating scripts and collaborative learning
methodologies. Additionally, both pedagogical approaches embraced a framework for
student collaboration that aligns with the team roles proposed by Urrutia-Aguila et al.
(2016). In contrast, the control group received conventional biology instruction, denoted
as Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE). This diversified approach ensured a
comprehensive exploration of the potential impacts of DBE and PBL on the variables of

interest in this study.

Figure 3 visually represents the complex web of relationships under scrutiny in
this study. At its core, it investigated the interplay between the teaching approaches,
which serve as the independent variables, and the ensuing impact on three pivotal
dependent variables: cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking.

Additionally, this conceptual framework extended its reach to explore whether


transdisciplinary thinking, one of the dependent variables, can effectively predict

cognitive flexibility and growth mindset.

Furthermore, this framework illuminated the moderating role of academic
resilience, a critical construct, in the Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) teaching
approach. This mediation is particularly relevant when considering the effects of DBE on
the dependent variables. As such, this study investigated how these teaching approaches,
namely DBE, Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and Non-Design-Based Biology
Education (NDBE), impact students’ cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and

transdisciplinary thinking.

Beyond the direct effects of these teaching approaches on the dependent variables,
the framework examines the indirect positive effects. Specifically, it sought to unveil how
the DBE teaching approach may positively influence the dependent variables moderated
by the construct of academic resilience. By doing so, this research sorted out the
elaborate dynamics that underlie the educational terrain, offering insights into how

teaching approaches can shape students’ cognitive and behavioral attributes.

Additionally, the study ventured into unmapped territory by probing whether
transdisciplinary thinking, a skill fostered within these pedagogical approaches, held the
potential to predict cognitive flexibility and a growth mindset. This multifaceted
exploration encapsulated the comprehensive scope of this research, which aspired to
provide a holistic understanding of the transformative potential of DBE, PBL, and NDBE

in biology education.


Research exploring Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) has been on the
ascent, driven by its potential to foster the pinnacle of human cognition. This innovative
approach placed a premium on collaborative creation, with the ultimate aim of producing
feasible and authentic prototypes—a process that calls upon the highest echelons of
cognitive prowess (Celikéz et al., 2019; Haruehansawasin & Kiattikomol, 2018; Hmelo-

Silver & Eberbach, 2012).

Indeed, these prototypes are tangible manifestations of high-order thinking skills
as learners engage in ‘creating,’ which resides at the zenith of human cognitive abilities
(Sharunova et al., 2022). Consequently, DBE emerges as a potent catalyst for the
cultivation of this advanced cognitive thinking skillset, encompassing cognitive
flexibility. growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking (Eliyawati et al., 2020; Ibrahim

& Abd. Halim, 2013; Latada & Kassim, 2017).

In fundamental nature, DBE acts as an incubator for nurturing cognitive abilities
that transcend traditional paradigms of education, equipping learners with the insight to
navigate the complexities of the modern world. Through this lens, the research paradigm
gains clarity, spotlighting DBE's transformative potential in shaping students’ cognitive

and behavioral attributes.

Despite the existing body of research on Design-Based Biology Education (DBE),
there remains a conspicuous gap in understanding its impact on critical facets such as
cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. This uncharted
territory in the DBE scene prompted the researcher to embark on a pioneering
exploration, seeking to shed light on the transformative potential of this innovative

pedagogical approach.


Equally compelling is the shortage of studies investigating the moderating role of
academic resilience—an independent variable in this research—in developing these
crucial learning skills, all of which serve as dependent variables. This uncharted territory
offers an intriguing vantage point from which to unveil the complicated dynamics within

the DBE paradigm.

Moreover, the researcher's quest extends to the unexplored terrain of regression
analysis, which, to their knowledge, has yet to be undertaken in the context of DBE. This
analytical approach promises to unravel the interplay between transdisciplinary thinking,

cognitive flexibility, and growth mindset—a rich tapestry waiting to be unveiled.

Guided by the theoretical underpinnings of DBE, this investigation holds the
potential to unlock the pathways to promoting and cultivating these essential constructs,

forging a new frontier in education and cognitive development.

Research Hypotheses

Figure 4 offers a visual representation of the hypothesized conceptual framework
that underpins this study. It serves as a schematic illustration of the complicated web of
relationships that will be explored, shedding light on the interplay between the teaching
approaches—Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), Problem-Based Learning (PBL),
and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE)—and the essential learning skills:

cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking.

Moreover, this visual representation examines the indirect effects of academic

resilience as a moderating variable bridging the gap between the teaching approaches and

the learning skills mentioned earlier. It unveils the potential pathways through which

academic resilience can influence and enhance these skills in the context of biology

education.

Lastly, Figure 4 contemplates the predictive power of transdisciplinary thinking.

It examines whether this particular skill can serve as a harbinger of cognitive flexibility

and a growth mindset, offering a glimpse into the potential correlations and interactions

that may emerge from the intervention.

c. Transdisciplinary thinking.
5. Transdisciplinary thinking of students exposed to Design-Based Biology
Education (DBE) positively predicts their cognitive flexibility and growth

mindset.

Definition of Terms

In the present research, it became imperative to establish clear and comprehensive
definitions for the pivotal terms and concepts that form the bedrock of the study. By
doing so, the researcher aimed to ensure a solid foundation for understanding and
interpreting the outcomes and findings. Below, the terms utilized in the study are
elucidated, both in conceptual and operational terms, to provide an understanding of their

significance and the context in which they are employed.

Academic resilience represents an individual's ability to bounce back from

setbacks and challenges in an educational context. It involves motivation, competence.


and determination to succeed despite obstacles (Jowkar et al., 2019). In this study,
academic resilience refers to the moderating role of students’ resilience in their academic
pursuits. It is assessed by examining the indirect effects of academic resilience on the
relationships between the teaching approaches (DBE, PBL, and NDBE) and the
dependent variables (cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking)
using a researcher-made scale — Filipino Learners’ Academic Resilience Scale (FLARS).
When learners get higher scores on the FLARS, it indicates a higher degree of academic

resiliency.

Cognitive flexibility is a cognitive skill characterized by the ability to adapt and
shift one's thinking and problem-solving strategies in response to changing circumstances
or novel situations. It involves perceiving multiple perspectives, generating alternative
solutions, and embracing uncertainty (Spiro et al., 1988). In the context of this research,
cognitive flexibility refers to the capacity of students to flexibly perceive various
alternative interpretations of life events and generate multiple alternative resolutions for
challenging situations, as assessed through a standardized scale developed by Dennis and
Vander Wal (2010) - Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI). In this research, higher scores

on the CFI indicate a greater degree of cognitive flexibility among the learners.

Design-Based Education is an innovative pedagogical approach integrating
design thinking principles into biology education. It emphasizes the collaborative
creation of authentic prototypes to address complex real-world problems, fostering
critical thinking and creativity among learners (Brown, 2008). In this study, DBE refers

to the educational intervention that integrates design thinking principles into biology


teaching. It encompasses the structured phases of empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and

test, culminating in students’ collaborative creation of authentic prototypes.

Growth mindset is a belief system wherein individuals perceive their abilities
and intelligence as malleable and capable of improvement through effort, learning, and
perseverance. It encourages a focus on learning and development rather than on fixed
attributes (Dweck, 2019). In this study, growth mindset pertains to students' beliefs in
their capacity for improvement, their efforts to emphasize and cultivate a growth mindset,
their belief in the variance of abilities among individuals, and their determination to avoid
procrastination. These aspects are assessed through the Mindset Theory Scale developed
by Yilmaz (2021). This means higher scores on items related to belief in improvement
and effort to emphasize growth mindset indicate a more robust growth mindset among
students. In comparison, lower scores on items related to belief in invariance and

procrastination reflect a stronger tendency toward a fixed mindset.

Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE) represents traditional, teacher-
centered approaches to biology instruction that do not incorporate design thinking
principles or emphasize creative problem solving. Operationally, NDBE typically
involves lecture-based teaching, textbook-centered learning, and limited opportunities for

students to engage in authentic problem solving or collaborative activities.

Problem-Based Learning (PBL) is an educational approach that centers on
solving complex, real-world problems to promote deep understanding and critical
thinking. Operationally, PBL includes a set of steps, such as gathering information,

defining the problem, generating possible solutions, testing solutions through product


creation, and reflecting on the problem-solving process. It may not always require

collaborative efforts and offers flexibility in problem-solving duration.

Transdisciplinary thinking involves the capacity to bridge and connect
knowledge, concepts, and approaches from various disciplines to address complex,
multifaceted problems. It encourages an integrative, collaborative, and inquiry-driven
approach to learning and problem solving (Nicolescu, 2010). Within this research,
transdisciplinary thinking encompasses the ability of students to approach problems in an
integrative manner, collaborate effectively with peers from different disciplines, and
engage in inquiry-driven learning. These facets are assessed through a structured
research-made scale — the Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS). As reflected in TTS
scores, higher scores on the TTS indicate a higher level of transdisciplinary thinking
among students. Thus, they can connect concepts across disciplines and they have the

capacity to engage in collaborative and inquiry-driven problem solving.

METHODOLOGY

In this comprehensive chapter, the researcher plunges into the elaborate details of
the research methodology, which serves as the bedrock of the study. This chapter is
designed to provide a clear and robust framework that guided the research throughout the

investigation, ensuring the rigor and validity of the study.

The research design is the cornerstone of the study, outlining the roadmap that
was followed to test the hypotheses and address the research questions. It dictates the
structure and approach employed to gather and analyze data, setting the stage for

meaningful insights.

To illuminate the human dimension of the study, the researcher introduces the
participants who played a pivotal role - the sample or respondents. These individuals
represent the heart of the research, contributing their unique perspectives and

experiences, which enrich the understanding and findings.

The instruments utilized to measure the effects of the intervention are
fundamental to the study. The researcher takes a deep dive into the development and
validation of these instruments, ensuring their reliability and accuracy in capturing the
multifaceted nuances of the variables. The critical pilot testing phase is also explored, as

it is essential in refining the tools for data collection.

At the core of the research lies the intervention, the focal point where different

groups, including the treatment and control groups, were exposed to distinct teaching


approaches —Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), Problem-Based Learning (PBL),
and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE). The researcher focused on the
pedagogical methods employed, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of these

approaches and their potential impact.

The data collection procedures are scrupulously detailed, outlining the strategies
employed to gather the valuable information required for the study. These strategies are

carefully designed to ensure data accuracy and relevance.

Finally, the researcher unveils the statistical treatments guiding the data analysis.
These treatments are instrumental in uncovering potential significant differences between
groups following their exposure to the intervention, contributing to the depth and breadth

of the research insights.

This chapter serves as the foundational framework for the research endeavor. It
sets the stage for a thorough, insightful, and comprehensive exploration into the
complexities of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) and its potential effects on
cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. Also, it elaborates
on the moderating effects of academic resilience on the research variables and the
predictive power of transdisciplinary thinking on cognitive flexibility and growth
mindset. Ultimately, these interactions were the foundation for crafting an emergent

instructional innovation framework in biology education.


Research Design

The research design chosen for this study is quasi-experimental. In this design,
three intact heterogeneous classes were randomly selected and assigned to the control or
experimental groups. Out of these, one class served as the control group and followed the
Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE) approach. The remaining two classes
were designated experimental groups, focusing on Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE), including the empathizing phase, and the other concentrating on Problem-Based

Learning (PBL).

The teacher-researcher taught all classes, but each group followed a distinct
lesson flow and utilized specific learning materials tailored to their respective teaching
approach. This differentiation ensured that the interventions were implemented as

intended.

The research implementation spanned three months, from January 2024 to March
2024, equivalent to one academic quarter. This duration allowed for a comprehensive

assessment of the effects of the teaching approaches on the variables under investigation.

Figure 5 illustrates the three-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design
notation that were utilized in the study, summarizing the research structure and group

assignments.

Moreover, this study utilized a mixed-methods research design to understand the
research questions comprehensively. The quantitative data were collected using four
research instruments to measure the dependent variables: academic resilience, cognitive
flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. The instrument to measure
academic resilience was not administered in the posttest because academic resilience
serves as a moderator in this study. Consequently, the pretest results for academic
resilience were used to assess its moderating effect on the other dependent variables. This
approach ensures that the influence of academic resilience on outcomes such as cognitive
flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking can be accurately evaluated

without confounding posttest measurements.

On the other hand, the qualitative data were gathered from various sources,
including students’ reflective journals, their produced output or learning artifacts, and
transcripts from focus group discussions. By integrating qualitative data within the
quantitative framework, this approach aimed to enrich the understanding of the

quantitative findings and provide in-depth insights into the research variables.

The data collected through these methods were analyzed independently.
Subsequently, the results were integrated and interpreted collectively, following
established research practices (Creswell et al., 2004). This mixed-methods approach
exhaustively explored the research questions and allowed for a deeper understanding of

the phenomena under investigation (Figure 6).

The Sample

This study involved a purposive sampling technique to select Senior High School
students from three distinct classes, each with varying academic abilities. As these classes
were intact, the distribution of male and female students was not within the researcher's
control. Thus, a random selection method through the fishbowl method was employed to
assign the classes to the three teaching approaches. Furthermore, within each class,

students were divided into smaller groups, each of five randomly chosen members.

The research encompassed 141 Senior High School students currently enrolled in
a regular semester for the School Year 2023-2024, ranging in age from 14 to 17 years. It
is important to note that the gender distribution among students in each group may not be
equal due to the intact nature of these groups, and random assignment was not feasible.
This limitation was acknowledged and may influence the study's outcomes (Akabayashi

et al., 2020).

Prior to the commencement of data collection, the researcher adhered to strict

ethical research standards. The initial steps involved seeking permission from the


students’ parents through an informative letter detailing the study's purpose and
procedures. In this letter, parents were asked for informed consent regarding their
children's participation in the study, including involvement in focus group discussions.
Subsequently, students’ affirmative agreement to participate in the research was obtained
through the Assent form. Before this stage, the superintendent, the head of the school
division office, approved the request letter, ensuring adherence to ethical standards

throughout the study.

The teacher-researcher assured parents they could decline participation without
adverse consequences for their children. Additionally, stringent measures were
implemented to ensure anonymity and confidentiality, safeguarding the identity of all

respondents.

The Instruments

The researcher developed and validated two distinct scales, serving as research
instruments for assessing a dependent variable and the moderating variable within the
study - specifically, transdisciplinary thinking and academic resilience, respectively.
Furthermore, the researcher adapted existing instruments to assess cognitive flexibility
and growth mindset. These cognitive and behavioral dimensions were examined to
discern whether the teaching approaches constituting the research intervention bring

about improvements among the participating students.

Figure 7 delineates the procedures the researcher followed rigorously in
developing and validating these instruments. These procedures were categorized into

three distinct phases: item development, scale development. and scale evaluation, as


recommended by Boateng et al. (2018). This thorough approach ensured the robustness

and reliability of the research instruments employed in this study.

Step 9: Test of validity

In Figure 7, scale development and validation commence with the generation of

items by conducting a comprehensive review of the relevant literature about the

constructs of interest - specifically, transdisciplinary thinking and academic resilience.

Subsequently, the initial set of items underwent a crucial content validation phase,

wherein expert reviewers assessed their alignment with the intended constructs. Pre-

testing followed this stage, during which exploratory factor analysis was employed to

extract underlying factors, and item reduction and refinement occurred as necessary. The

reliability of the scales was accurately assessed through pilot testing of all research

instruments, both adapted and newly developed. The Cronbach alpha coefficient, a

widely recognized measure of internal consistency, was computed to ensure that the



research instruments exhibit an acceptable level of reliability, typically indicated by a

value of 0.70 or higher (Taber, 2018).

The administration of the four research instruments involved 516 high school
students in Bulacan enrolled during the previous School Year 2022-2023. To adapt to the
ongoing global pandemic, the tests were administered using an online platform,
specifically Google Forms, ensuring the safety of the respondents and mitigating the risk
of printed materials serving as potential carriers of COVID-19. To enhance the
authenticity of responses, students were encouraged to complete the survey
questionnaires under the supervision of their respective advisers or subject teachers.
Furthermore, all statements within the research instruments were expertly translated into
Filipino to facilitate comprehension. A panel of experts also carefully reviewed the
research tools, and their valuable comments and suggestions were thoughtfully integrated

into the survey questionnaires before the pilot administration.
In the context of this study, four distinct research instruments were utilized:

1. The Filipino Learners’ Academic Resilience Scale (FLARS),

2. The Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI) developed by Dennis and Vander Wal
(2010),

3. The Mindset Theory Scale (MTS) developed by Yilmaz (2021), and

4. The Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS), developed specifically for this

research

Subsequent sections of this study were expounded upon the processes involved in

developing. validating, and pilot-testing these research instruments. Additionally, the


researcher employed analytic rubrics to assess the outputs generated by students across
all three intact classes, with the evaluation process benefiting from the input of experts in

the field of biology education.

Filipino Learners’ Academic Resilience Scale (FLARS)

The Filipino Learners' Academic Resilience Scale (FLARS), developed by the
researcher Honra (2022), is the assessment tool employed in this study to evaluate
students’ academic resilience. This instrument was specifically designed to measure the
degree of learners' resilience in the educational context, reflecting their enhanced
likelihood of success in school, even when confronted with environmental adversities
stemming from early traits, conditions, and experiences, as discussed by Jowkar et al.

(2019).

The FLARS questionnaire initially comprised 37 items, which was reduced to 21
items after pilot-testing and analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, each rated by
respondents using a 4-point scale to express their level of agreement with each statement.
The scale employs the following descriptors: 4 — Strongly agree, 3 — Agree, 2 — Disagree,
and | — Strongly disagree. Notably, the FLARS encompasses two distinct
subcomponents, which revolve around internal and external protective factors.
Consequently, higher scores on the FLARS signify a greater degree of academic

resilience among the learners participating in the study.

The internal protective factors within the FLARS pertain to personal
characteristics and attributes that contribute to academic resilience, such as self-efficacy,

optimism, perseverance, and adaptive coping strategies. On the other hand, external


protective factors encompass environmental and contextual factors that support academic
resilience, including social support networks, access to resources, and positive school

climates.

Table 9 presents the internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha) and descriptive
statistics for FLARS and its respective subscales, Internal Protective Factor and External
Protective Factor. With a sample size (N) of 402, subscales and the overall scale
demonstrate strong internal consistency, as indicated by Cronbach's alphas, ranging from
-883 to .923. The means for Internal Protective Factor (M = 3.28) and External Protective
Factor (M = 3.18) suggest a moderately positive perception across these dimensions. In
contrast, the overall mean for FLARS (M = 3.24) indicates a generally favorable view of
academic resilience among participants. However, the wide standard deviations,
particularly for the overall scale (SD = 9.64), suggest notable variability in respondents’
perceptions. This variability may reflect the diverse experiences and perspectives within
the sample regarding family dynamics and relationships. Overall, the findings suggest
that while respondents perceive academic resilience positively, there is significant

individual variation in their perceptions.


Table 9

External Protective Factor 8 3.18 4.54 883
Overall 21 3.24 9.64 .923

Note. N = 402

Furthermore, the FLARS questionnaire exhibited exceptional consistency and
reliability during the pilot testing phase, with a Cronbach alpha coefficient of a = .925 for
the 21 items. This high level of internal consistency underscores the reliability and
suitability of the FLARS as a robust tool for assessing academic resilience in the context

of this research (see Appendix G).

Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI)

The Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI), initially developed by Dennis and
Vander Wal (2010), served as an adapted research instrument employed in this study to
assess the cognitive flexibility of learners (see request letter in Appendix A). The CFI
primarily gauged students’ capacity to adapt and modify their cognitive processes.

enabling them to navigate various situational challenges effectively.

The CFI comprises 20 items, each evaluated by respondents using a 5-point scale

to express their level of agreement. This instrument examines two distinct

WW

subcomponents: the Alternatives scale, encompassing 13 items, and the Control scale,
comprising seven items. The scale's rating descriptions range from 5 — Strongly agree to
1 — Strongly disagree, assessing respondents’ perspectives. Notably, items 2, 4, 7, 9, 11,
and 17 were subject to reverse scoring, ensuring their inclusion contributes to the
comprehensive evaluation of cognitive flexibility. In essence, higher scores on the CFI

signify a greater degree of cognitive flexibility exhibited by the respondents.

Following the pilot testing phase, the CFI demonstrated robust reliability, with a
calculated Cronbach's alpha coefficient of a = .830 for the full 20-item scale. This high
level of internal consistency features the instrument's suitability for effectively measuring

cognitive flexibility within the context of this study (see Appendix D).

Mindset Theory Scale (MTS)

In the current study, the Mindset Theory Scale (MTS), developed by Yilmaz
(2021), was employed to assess the mindsets of the learners, encompassing both growth
and fixed mindsets (see request letter in Appendix B). This instrument was valuable for
evaluating students’ capacity to enhance specific skills they may struggle with over time,
emphasizing the importance of diligence and persistence in their growth and

development.

The MTS questionnaire comprises 13 items, with respondents using a 5-point
scale to express their level of agreement with each statement. This scale employs the
following descriptors: 5 - strongly agree, 4 - agree. 3 - somewhat agree or disagree, 2 -
disagree, and | - strongly disagree. The MTS is structured around four subcomponents

that capture growth and fixed mindsets. These sub-components are (a) belief in


improvement, (b) effort to emphasize a growth mindset, (c) belief in invariance, and (d)
not procrastinating — subcomponents a and b represent growth mindset while
subcomponents c and d correspond to a fixed mindset. Notably, the researcher maintained
the original 5-point scale format, as the instrument's developer prescribed. However, it's
worth mentioning that items 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11 underwent reverse scoring, given their
alignment with the fixed mindset dimension. Conversely, higher scores on the remaining

items signify a stronger student growth mindset.

After evaluating the instrument's reliability, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was
initially calculated as .666 for all 13 items. However, upon closer analysis, it was
determined that the removal of item 2 would enhance the scale's reliability. This decision
was made due to redundancy with other items in the scale. Following this adjustment, the
reliability score notably increased to .736. As a result, the MTS was refined to include 12

items, leading to satisfactory reliability outcomes (refer to Appendix E for details).

Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS)

The Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS) employed in this study is a
researcher-developed survey questionnaire to assess students’ capacity to establish
connections between specific concepts across various disciplines. This instrument
enabled each domain to provide a richer explanation of the others, emphasizing the
integration of knowledge (Honra, 2024). The TTS comprises three key subcomponents:
integrative, collaborative. and inquiry-driven, aligning with the domains of

transdisciplinary learning as outlined by Montuori (2013).

These three operational components of the Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale

(TTS) encompass: the Integrative Component, evaluating students’ ability to synthesize


concepts from diverse disciplines for a comprehensive understanding of complex issues;
the Collaborative Component, assessing their effectiveness in teamwork and collective
problem solving across disciplines through collaborative inquiry and leveraging diverse
perspectives; and the Inquiry-Driven Component, which measures students' inclination
and proficiency in inquiry-based learning, including active information-seeking, inquiry
formulation, and exploration of interdisciplinary topics, reflecting their curiosity, critical

thinking, and depth of exploration.

Incorporating a 4-point rating scale, the TTS consists of 20 items, allowing
respondents to express their level of agreement with each statement. The scale's
descriptors are as follows: 4 — Strongly agree, 3 — Agree, 2 —- Disagree, and 1 — Strongly
disagree. Consequently, higher scores obtained on the TTS reflect a greater degree of

transdisciplinary thinking among the students.

Table 10 presents the internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha) and descriptive
statistics for the Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS) and its Integrative, Inquiry-
driven, and Collaborative subscales. With a sample size (N) of 402, all subscales and the
overall scale demonstrate strong internal consistency, indicated by Cronbach's alphas
ranging from .799 to .915. The means for Integrative (A = 3.34), Inquiry-driven (M =
3.28), and Collaborative (M = 3.01) suggest a moderate to moderately high level of
agreement among respondents in each respective aspect of transdisciplinary thinking. The
overall mean for TTS (M = 3.27) indicates a generally positive perception of
transdisciplinary thinking among participants. However, the wide standard deviations,
particularly for the overall scale (SD = 8.41), suggest remarkable variability in

respondents’ perceptions across all dimensions. This variability may reflect diverse


experiences and perspectives regarding transdisciplinary thinking within the sample.
Generally, the findings indicate that while respondents perceive transdisciplinary thinking
positively, there is significant individual variation in their perceptions and approaches to

this form of thinking.

Table 10

Collaborative 3 3.01 1.77 -799
Overall 20 3.27 8.41 915

Note. N = 402

Furthermore, it is essential to note that the TTS exhibited a notably high level of
internal consistency and reliability during the study's assessment, with a Cronbach alpha
coefficient of .915 for the 20 items, affirming its suitability and robustness as a research

instrument (see Appendix F).


Analytic Rubrics Used

The impact of the intervention in this study is centered around assessing students’
outputs or prototypes. To evaluate their achievements, scoring analytic rubrics were
thoroughly designed to align with the study's content and performance standards.
Additionally, the expertise of subject area specialists, who are seasoned science
educators, was sought to enhance the accuracy and objectivity of the rubrics, minimizing
evaluator errors and biases. The researcher welcomed and integrated feedback from these

expert evaluators to refine the assessment tools.

In developing the analytic rubrics, special attention was given to ensuring students
adhered to the design thinking process while creating their outputs within the Design-
Based Biology Education (DBE) approach. Distinct scoring rubrics were utilized for the
other groups: Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Non-Design-Based Biology Education

(NDBE).

In the case of the PBL group, emphasis was placed on students’ adherence to the
scientific method in crafting their outputs. Meanwhile, for the NDBE group, the analytic
rubric was aligned to students’ outputs with the performance standards outlined in the

Department of Education's curriculum guide.

The Teaching Approaches
The teacher-researcher taught the three intact, heterogeneous classes participating
in the study. These classes were randomly assigned to either the control or experimental

group. To ensure effective collaboration, all students in each class were organized into


small subgroups, each member taking on specific rotating roles, including facilitator,

recorder, researcher, and participant, as Urrutia-Aguila et al. (2016) recommended.

It is worth noting that the language used and the topics covered remained
consistent across all groups during the intervention. Research suggests that students’
native tongue or first language is crucial for effective science learning (Amedeker, 1998).
Recent studies have also indicated that students tend to grasp scientific concepts better
when taught in their mother tongue, which enhances confidence during discussions (Al
Turki et al., 2020). Therefore, code-switching between English and Filipino languages

was employed during the General Biology 2 classes to facilitate better comprehension.

Furthermore, the teacher-researcher adopted the 5Es learning cycle (Engage,
Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate) to teach all groups. The key distinction among
the groups lies in the problem-solving methodologies they employed to address complex
issues within the SE framework. For the Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) group,
students adhered to the design thinking problem solving process, encompassing empathy,
define, ideate, prototype, and test. In contrast, the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) group
tackled issues using the scientific method. The control group (Non-Design-Based
Biology Education - NDBE) received conventional teaching and problem-solving
approaches in biology. Each problem-solving strategy was seamlessly integrated into the

SE learning cycle.

Moreover, the two experimental groups incorporated problem solving approaches
into their prototype or output creation. The DBE group emphasized empathy as the core
of their problem-solving strategy, fostering an understanding of people's needs, wants,

behaviors, feelings, and thoughts. Conversely, the PBL group employed the systematic


scientific method to guide students in addressing complex biological questions or
challenges, involving steps like observation, hypothesis formulation, experimental

design, data collection, analysis, and hypothesis refinement.

Additionally, the control group (NDBE) adhered to the performance standards
prescribed by the Department of Education (DepEd) curriculum guide. However, in both
the NDBE and PBL groups, the prototypes or outputs were modified to address authentic,
real-life problems. All three groups engaged in similar inquiry-based instructional
activities that encourage problem examination. searching for viable solutions,
observations, reflections, question generation, hypothesis testing, creative thinking, and
applying insights. Additionally, identical formative and summative assessments were

administered to all groups during the intervention.

Figure 8 visually represents the research intervention employed among the three

groups.

The upcoming sections of this research investigate the significant events during
the learning cycles within the three groups: DBE, PBL, and NDBE, respectively. These
learning cycles encompass diverse activities carefully organized to foster cognitive
flexibility, transdisciplinary thinking, and a growth mindset. The underlying pedagogical
approach revolves around student-centered, inquiry-based learning environments,

recognized for their potential to enhance these cognitive attributes.

Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) approach

DBE and PBL embraced a problem-solving approach, culminating in creating
prototypes or output as evidence of the learning process. Consequently, learners in the
experimental groups were expected to produce two distinct projects or products
throughout three learning cycles. Furthermore, both experimental groups benefited from
scaffolding techniques and inquiry-based guide questions strategically integrated to
facilitate the learning experience.

What sets the DBE approach apart is incorporating a design thinking process,
with empathy as a pivotal component. Empathy empowered students not only to
recognize but also to empathize with the emotions and perspectives of others. This
empathetic lens enabled them to approach others' shoes, connect with their feelings, and
thoughtfully address the problem.

Figure 9 illustrates how the five-step design thinking process, as outlined by Luka
(2014), was seamlessly integrated into the double diamond model of the design thinking

process inspired by Parker et al. (2021). Additionally. the study's implementation drawn


upon the problem-solving steps proposed by Da Silva et al. (2018) to guide the process

further.

Figure 9

Double Diamond Model for Design Thinking Process

The double diamond model of the design thinking process (Figure 9)

encompasses four integral iterative steps: discover, define, develop, and deliver, building

upon the six collaborative steps articulated by Luka (2014).

In the initial discovery and definition phases, learners embarked on a journey to
identify and acquaint themselves with a real-life problem. This entailed a profound
understanding of the problem's significance and the potential beneficiaries of its

solutions. Engaging with individuals directly impacted by the issue is imperative, gaining


valuable insights to inform problem-solving approaches. In the definition phase, each
group has undertaken brainstorming sessions to pinpoint and prioritize the key problem
facets. Rigorous data analysis, often employing concept maps and diagrams like problem

tree analysis or Bull's eye diagramming, proves instrumental.

The subsequent step, development, necessitated learners’ collective efforts in
conceptualizing many plausible solutions to address the identified problem.
Brainstorming sessions facilitated the creation of prototypes, with every group member's
input regarded as invaluable. Employing a round-robin approach encourages active
participation and idea sharing. Visual aids such as sketches aided in comprehending and

discussing various solutions swiftly and intently.

As the process advances, the delivery phase involves presenting the developed
prototype (solution). Groups sought feedback from experts, ideally individuals with
firsthand experience in the problem domain. This iterative feedback loop ensured
continuous improvement. If necessary, revisions and refinements were made until the
optimal prototype, solution, or project emerged. Presentations played a pivotal role in this
phase, with external stakeholders who provided insights during the problem exploration

phase invited for a comprehensive review (see Appendix K for a sample lesson plan).

To summarize the core stages of the design thinking process guiding the problem-

solving steps in the DBE approach's implementation, refer to Table 11.


Table 11

future improvement

Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach

In the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach, students used scientific methods
to solve real-life issues to share similarities with the problem-solving steps used in
Design-Based Biology Education (DBE). However, a distinctive feature of the PBL
approach was the omission of the empathizing phase when defining the problem. While
DBE placed significant emphasis on understanding the problem from the perspective of

those affected, PBL streamlined this aspect.

Moreover, the PBL group actively participated in various activities integral to the
DBE approach. These activities include inquiry-based learning, group or team-based
problem solving strategies, scaffold-driven tasks, and integrative approaches to

conducting scientific activities and projects. This holistic approach to learning deepened


students’ understanding of biology concepts and fostered collaboration and critical

thinking.

Within the PBL approach, each learning cycle follows the SEs learning model —
Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. This structured framework ensured
that students were actively engaged in the learning process, from initial engagement with
the topic to evaluating their understanding and project outcomes. The projects undertaken
by PBL students are real-life ones and not aligned with the performance standards
recommended by the Department of Education (DepEd), ensuring that the learning

outcomes are consistent with the educational guidelines of the DBE approach.

Nevertheless, it's worth noting that the researcher thoughtfully modified the
problems presented to PBL learners to ensure they are firmly rooted in real-life, authentic
scenarios. These problem scenarios were carefully crafted to resonate with students’
experiences and to reflect the challenges they may encounter beyond the classroom. This

adjustment aimed to enhance the relevance and applicability of the learning experience.

The critical distinction between the two experimental groups, DBE and PBL, lies
in the absence of the design thinking process in the problem-solving methodology of the
PBL group. While DBE students engaged in a comprehensive design thinking process
that included empathy, ideation, prototyping, and testing, PBL students relied on
scientific methods and problem-solving techniques without the design thinking
component. This contrast in problem-solving approaches served as a critical point of
investigation in this study, exploring how different methods impact students' cognitive
flexibility, transdisciplinary thinking, and growth mindset (see Appendix L for a sample

lesson plan).


Table 12 summarizes the steps of the scientific method and describes its use in the

PBL group.

Non-Design-Based Education (NDBE) approach

The Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE) approach, designated as the
control group in this study, closely aligned with the lesson structure, followed by the
Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) and Problem-Based Learning (PBL)
approaches. However, distinct differences in the NDBE approach set it apart from the

experimental groups.


In the NDBE approach, the criteria for gauging learning success were based on
the curriculum guidelines provided by the Department of Education (DepEd). These
guidelines served as the foundational framework for curriculum design and content
delivery. Unlike the experimental groups, where learners engaged in problem-solving
activities, NDBE did not incorporate a problem-based learning methodology. Instead, it
adhered to a more traditional teaching approach, focusing on delivering content in a

structured manner.

One significant departure from the DBE and PBL approaches was the absence of
the design thinking process in the NDBE approach. While DBE emphasized empathy,
ideation, prototyping, and testing as essential steps in solving complex issues, NDBE
followed a linear instructional model. This meant that NDBE learners did not engage in
the in-depth empathetic exploration that characterizes DBE, nor did they employ design

thinking principles to tackle problems creatively.

Despite these differences, the NDBE approach shared some commonalities with
the experimental groups. It still integrated inquiry-based learning, group problem solving,
scaffold-driven tasks, and an emphasis on a comprehensive understanding of biology
concepts. Additionally, the SEs learning model, encompassing the stages of Engage,
Explore, Explain. Elaborate, and Evaluate, remained a central framework in NDBE's

instructional design.

Furthermore, the NDBE approach was a crucial point of reference in this study,
allowing for a comparative analysis of teaching strategies. While it retained some aspects
of student engagement and inquiry-based learning, it lacked the problem-solving depth

and design thinking principles in the DBE and PBL approaches. This contrast helped


elaborate the effectiveness of different teaching methods in enhancing students’ cognitive
flexibility, transdisciplinary thinking, and growth mindset (see Appendix M for a sample

lesson plan).

Comparative Summary of SE Learning Cycle Execution

In biology education, various teaching approaches were employed to engage
students and enhance their learning experiences. Three prominent methodologies, namely
Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and Non-
Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE), each offered unique strategies for facilitating
the understanding of biological concepts. A crucial aspect of these approaches was their
alignment with the 5E learning cycle, which consisted of five key phases: Engage,
Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. These phases provided a structured framework

for organizing and delivering biology lessons.

Table 13 summarizes how the teacher-researcher explored these three
instructional approaches—DBE, PBL, and NDBE—to execute the 5E learning cycle. By
examining the nuances of each approach within the context of the 5E model, the
researcher aimed to provide educators and researchers with valuable insights into their

practical application in biology education.

Based on Table 13, the comparative summary of how DBE, PBL, and NDBE
executed the SE learning cycle revealed unique features and similarities in their
instructional strategies. These distinctions clarified the diverse approaches to engaging

students in biology education.

In the "Engage" phase, DBE employed a design thinking process, including
empathy, to stimulate students’ interest and curiosity by connecting with real-world
issues. PBL, on the other hand, skipped the empathizing phase but still engaged students
by presenting them with challenging problems. NDBE followed a more traditional

approach, relying on curriculum-guided content.

Moving to the "Explore" phase, DBE encouraged students to explore the problem
deeply, fostering inquiry and critical thinking. PBL also emphasized exploration,
promoting inquiry-based learning to investigate complex issues. In contrast, NDBE

focused on delivering content without significant investigation.


The "Explain" phase saw DBE emphasizing collaborative discussions and concept
clarification, allowing students to grasp biological concepts more deeply. PBL similarly
emphasized group discussions but may lack the structured design thinking process seen in

DBE. NDBE concentrated on teacher-led explanations and content delivery.

In the "Elaborate" phase, DBE students applied their understanding to create
authentic solutions, integrating design thinking. PBL promoted problem solving, though
not necessarily following the design thinking process. NDBE students typically

completed assignments or activities related to the content.

Lastly, the "Evaluate" phase assessed learning outcomes. DBE evaluated not only
content understanding but also the effectiveness of the design solution. PBL assessed
problem-solving skills and content comprehension. NDBE mainly assessed content

knowledge.

In conclusion, while DBE and PBL emphasized problem solving and inquiry-
based learning within the SE framework, DBE incorporated the design thinking process,
fostering empathy and creativity. NDBE, in contrast, followed a more traditional content-
focused approach. The choice between these approaches depended on educational goals,

student needs, and the desired level of engagement in biology education.

Comparative Summary of Classroom Activities
In this section, this study presents a comprehensive comparison of three distinct
teaching approaches: Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), Problem-Based Learning

(PBL). and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE).


This comparison focused on the classroom activities to deliver the specific
content standards. Each teaching approach employed diverse student activities, yielded
distinct outcomes, and utilized unique teaching strategies to comprehensively understand
these complex biological topics. This comparison aimed to explain the strengths and
limitations of each approach in enhancing students' learning experiences and fostering a

more profound comprehension of key biological concepts.

Table 14 summarizes the classroom activities utilized in the DBE, PBL, and

NDBE approaches.

The comparison table above (Table 14) provided a comprehensive overview of
how three distinct teaching approaches - Design-Based Biology Education (DBE),
Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE) -
address specific content standards related to Recombinant DNA, Evolution, and
Fundamental Taxonomic Concepts and Principles. The succeeding paragraphs discuss
these approaches to better grasp their implications for student activities, outcomes, and

teaching strategies within these complex biological topics.

Student Activities:

In the DBE approach, students actively engaged in hands-on activities that foster
creativity and innovation. By incorporating design thinking principles, they followed a
structured process that included empathizing with end-users, defining problems, and
proposing solutions. This approach encouraged students to explore biology concepts

through practical problem solving experiences.

PBL students also participated in active learning, focusing on real-world problems
in biology. They investigated issues, conducted experiments, and applied scientific
methods to find solutions. Collaboration and group discussions were integral to their

activities, promoting teamwork and critical thinking.

In contrast, NDBE primarily followed a traditional approach, where students

typically engaged in activities such as lectures, textbook-based learning, and assessments


aligned with curriculum standards. The emphasis here was on covering prescribed

content.

Outcome:

DBE aims to produce well-rounded students who comprehend biology concepts
and possess essential problem-solving skills, creativity, and the ability to apply design
thinking principles to real-world challenges. The outcomes included a deeper

understanding of biology concepts and an aptitude for innovative problem solving.

PBL outcomes revolved around improved critical thinking, problem-solving
abilities, and a deeper grasp of biology topics. Students developed research skills and the

capacity to work collaboratively, equipping them for real-world challenges in biology.

On the other hand, NDBE primarily focused on content mastery and standardized
assessments. The outcomes were centered on students’ knowledge of specific curriculum

standards, which were assessed traditionally.

Teaching Strategies:

DBE employed teaching strategies that promote student-driven inquiry,
collaboration, and hands-on problem solving. Integrating design thinking methodologies
into biology instruction encouraged students to actively participate in their learning and

explore complex topics through a creative lens.

PBL utilized teaching strategies that guide students through authentic problem

solving experiences. It emphasized student-centered learning, group discussions, and self-


directed inquiry. These strategies empowered students to become independent thinkers

and researchers.

In contrast, NDBE relied on traditional teaching methods, including lectures,
assignments, and assessments that were aligned with curriculum standards. The emphasis

here was on delivering content in a structured manner.

Content Standards:

When addressing Recombinant DNA, DBE and PBL offered opportunities for
students to explore this topic in depth through hands-on experimentation and problem
solving. These approaches enabled students to understand genetic engineering techniques
and their applications better. In contrast, NDBE covered this topic through traditional

lectures and assessments, potentially missing out on the practical aspects.

All three approaches effectively addressed the concept of evolution, but DBE and
PBL provided opportunities for students to explore the subject deeper through inquiry-
based activities and discussions. These approaches allowed students to explore

evolutionary theories, evidence, and mechanisms more interactively and engagingly.

Regarding Fundamental Taxonomic Concepts and Principles, DBE and PBL
stood out by providing opportunities for students to explore taxonomy through interactive
and engaging activities. These approaches encouraged students to apply their knowledge
in classifying organisms and understanding the principles of biological classification.

NDBE, on the other hand, relied more on rote memorization of taxonomic categories.


In summary, the choice of teaching approach significantly impacted student
engagement, learning outcomes, and the depth of understanding of complex biological
topics. DBE and PBL emphasized problem solving, critical thinking, and hands-on
activities, leading to more comprehensive and enduring learning experiences. NDBE,
while effective in covering content standards, may offer limited opportunities for active

student engagement and creativity.

Data Collection Procedure

The current study employed a comprehensive mixed methods design,
accentuating a three-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental approach to data
collection. To ensure the robustness of the adapted and researcher-made research
instruments, the researcher initiated a rigorous pilot testing phase. For the adopted survey
questionnaires, the researcher sought approval from the original developers, striving to
maintain the instruments’ integrity. Furthermore, the scoring analytic rubrics, carefully
crafted by the researcher for evaluating students’ projects, underwent careful validation
by a panel of experts. This validation process adopted an iterative Delphi approach,
encompassing two rounds of evaluation, with the researcher diligently incorporating
expert feedback to finalize the rubrics (Skulmoski et al., 2007). In parallel, the
construction of the focus group discussion (FGD) protocol (see Appendix N) undertook

thorough scrutiny involving reviews by the research adviser and other experts.

Upon securing the requisite permissions from the superintendent of the chosen
Schools Division Office (see Appendix C and H) and obtaining consent and assent forms

from parents and participating students (see Appendix I and J), the researcher embarked


on a one-month observational period. This initial phase aimed to establish rapport with
the respondents, allowing the researcher to gain valuable insights into the intact classes

randomly selected for the study.

With all research protocols in place, administering the four survey questionnaires,
targeting critical skillsets like academic resilience, cognitive flexibility, growth mindset,
and transdisciplinary thinking, commenced. Subsequently, the teacher-researcher initiated
the research intervention, encompassing six learning cycles that align with the General
Biology 2 content and performance standards for senior high school students. The
instructional model of choice was the widely acclaimed SEs framework, guiding students

through the engaging phases of exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation.

Given the mixed-methods approach, students were encouraged to document their
learning experiences following each learning cycle. Additionally, selected students from
each group actively participated in focus group discussions immediately after the last
learning cycle. These discussions were designed to extract qualitative insights, enhancing
the quantitative data collected. The focus group questions were thoughtfully aligned with
the overarching research questions, facilitating a deeper understanding of the
intervention's impact. Additionally, students’ reflections through journal writing,
answering some prompts (see Appendix O), and pieces of evidence of learning, such as

outputs and artifacts, were used for triangulation purposes.

Finally, to assess the intervention's effectiveness, the four survey questionnaires
employed in the pretest were readministered as a posttest, except for the Filipino
Learners’ Academic Resilience Scale (FLARS). Figure 10 briefly summarizes the

thoroughly devised step-by-step data collection procedure by the researcher.

Pre-intervention Phase

Before the data-gathering phase of my research, the researcher met with the
school head and the senior high school coordinator. The school head laid out specific
provisions and conditions to protect the subjects involved. These conditions included

voluntary participation, safeguarding students’ identity, and a mandate that the data


gathering should not disrupt classes while ensuring that competencies were achieved.
Following this, the school head endorsed me to the senior high school coordinator, who
then introduced the researcher to the teacher whose classes the researcher would be
handling during the data gathering. Additionally, the senior high school coordinator and a
master teacher reviewed the lesson plans for the intervention phase, ensuring they aligned
with the Most Essential Learning Competencies (MELCs) set by the Department of

Education (DepEd).

The school adopted blended learning modalities, with in-person classes on
Mondays and Wednesdays, asynchronous classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays via Google
Classroom, and ‘catch-up Friday’ to enhance literacy skills per DepEd Memorandum No.
001, series 2024. During the intervention phase, classes were scheduled from Mondays to
Thursdays, each lasting 50 minutes. This approach aimed to provide students with a

comprehensive and balanced learning experience.

Building rapport was crucial, and the researcher met with the three intact classes
to establish a connection. The researcher distributed consent and participant assent forms
for the research, emphasizing the importance of voluntary participation. These forms
were collected in the subsequent meeting, ensuring that ethical considerations were

prioritized throughout the research.

The allocation of classes into DBE, PBL, and NDBE groups was determined
through a random assignment using the fishbowl method. Witnesses included the senior
high school coordinator, a master teacher, and the teacher of the respective classes. The
DBE group consisted of 49 students, the PBL group had 44 students, and the NDBE

group comprised 48 students.


To ensure efficient pretest administration, research instruments such as the
Filipino Learners’ Academic Resilience Scale, Cognitive Flexibility Inventory, Mindset
Theory Scale, and Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale were administered using Google
Forms. This online method allowed participants to complete the assessments without

reducing the time allocated for classroom instruction.

Lastly, handouts on Design Thinking and problem-based learning were provided
to the DBE and PBL groups, respectively. These materials were posted on Google
Classroom, and students were organized into six groups, each assuming rotating roles
such as facilitator, recorder, researcher, and participant. This hands-on approach aimed to
enhance engagement and foster a dynamic learning environment. Table 15 presents the

weekly schedule observed before, during, and after the teaching research interventions.

The table above summarizes the teaching intervention across three phases: pre-
intervention, intervention, and post-intervention. During the pre-intervention phase
(January 29 to February 2, 2024), the groundwork was laid, including securing
permissions, aligning lesson plans, and completing administrative tasks. The intervention
phase (February 5 to March 15, 2024) focused on structured lessons, monitoring
progress, and engaging students interactively. The post-intervention phase (March 18 to
22, 2024) involved assessments, group discussions, and collecting reflections to evaluate
the intervention's impact on student learning. This systematic approach ensured a

comprehensive examination of outcomes.

Intervention Phase

In a concerted effort to ascertain the effectiveness of Design-Based Biology
Education (DBE) as a pedagogical approach, the researcher embarked on a systematic
inquiry involving three groups of Grade 11 STEM students. These groups were randomly
assigned to distinct instructional methodologies: DBE, PBL, and a control group
subjected to conventional didactic approaches, denoted as NDBE. The primary aim was
to elucidate the potential impact of these methodologies on students’ cognitive flexibility,
growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking, with academic resilience and

transdisciplinary thinking posited as moderating variables.

Across the duration of Academic Year 2023-2024, students learned genetics,
evolution, and taxonomy concepts. Each instructional session, spanning Monday through
Thursday afternoons, comprised a 50-minute duration. The DBE group commenced their

educational pursuits at 3:10 pm, succeeded by the PBL group at 5:20 pm, with the NDBE


group culminating the day's instructional activities at 6:10 pm. Notably, each session was
carefully structured to align with the unique tenets of the designated instructional

approach.

Pedagogical strategies employed across all groups were carefully calibrated to
embody student-centeredness and inquiry-based methodologies such as trait inheritance
simulation, DNA extraction lab, gene expression role-play, fossil analysis activity,
natural selection simulation, biogeography research project, species classification project,
biodiversity survey, and phylogenetic tree construction. These activities promote hands-
on learning, critical thinking, and collaboration, helping students understand key

biological concepts and the scientific process better.

From dynamic discussions to experiential learning endeavors, each instructional
modality sought to nurture critical thinking and problem-solving proficiencies. Notably,
within the DBE group, students embraced design thinking, guided by the iterative 4D
model encapsulating Discovery, Definition, Development, and Delivery. This framework,
akin to a double-diamond thinking paradigm, fostered divergent and convergent cognitive

processes.

Concurrently, students within the PBL group navigated authentic
problembsolving scenarios leveraging the scientific method as a foundational framework.
This systematic approach, characterized by iterative phases encompassing hypothesis
formulation, experimentation, data analysis, and dissemination, facilitated comprehensive
inquiry. Conversely, the NDBE group adhered to conventional instructional practices,
with educational outputs tethered to the prescribed curriculum delineated in General

Biology 2 guidelines.


Throughout the pedagogical intervention, the teacher of the three intact classes,
herself, a biology teacher, assumed a pivotal role as a pedagogical guide. Collaborating
closely with the researcher, she ensured fidelity to instructional protocols and steadfast
adherence to ethical research practices. Together, they devised a series of learning cycles,
whose teaching and learning activities are summarized and delineated in Table 16, each

serving as a connection for scholarly exploration and cognitive development.

classroom can create a more vibrant and effective learning environment.

NDBE-Student15: To enhance the learning of the students in the classroom, I
suggest to play some games for students to have fun and also make the discussion
more interesting. These approaches can make learning more interactive,
practical, and personalized to different learning styles and promoting critical
thinking and creativity among students.

NDBE Learning Cycle 5

In a conventional teaching approach to taxonomy, students engage in a dynamic
"Classification Station Rotation" activity to deepen their understanding of biological
classification. As students move through different stations, each dedicated to a specific
taxonomic group, such as mammals, birds, or insects, they immerse themselves in the
world of biodiversity. At each station, students encounter diverse specimens or images
representing various organisms within the designated taxonomic group. Armed with field
guides and reference materials, students accurately examine each organism's physical
characteristics, habitat preferences, and behavioral traits to determine its place within the

classification hierarchy.


Throughout the activity, the teacher guides, providing essential support and
facilitating discussions to reinforce taxonomy principles. Students actively engage in
conversations, asking questions, sharing observations, and collaboratively working to
classify the organisms they encounter. Through these interactions, students refine their
understanding of classification criteria and develop critical thinking and problem-solving
skills. Interestingly, as students probe deeper into the classification process, they often
make intriguing observations and connections, uncovering the complicated relationships
between different organisms and their environments. These moments of discovery ignite

curiosity and foster a deeper appreciation for the complexities of the natural world.

Overall, the "Classification Station Rotation" activity offers students a hands-on,
interactive learning experience that transcends traditional classroom instruction. By
actively engaging with specimens and collaborating with peers, students develop an
understanding of taxonomy while honing their observational skills and scientific inquiry
abilities. Moreover, the activity cultivates a sense of wonder and curiosity about the
natural world, sparking students’ lifelong interest in biodiversity and ecological

exploration.

Upon reading some students' reflections, some mentioned that the activity allowed
them to understand the concept better and sparked their curiosity. Through the
"Classification Station Rotation" activity, students examined organism identification and
classification, guided by their teacher's expertise and fueled by their own curiosity. This
reflection encapsulates the insights gained and experiences cherished as students
navigated through the fascinating scenario of biological diversity within the structured

confines of the classroom.


NDBE-Student 18: Engaging in the Classification Station Rotation activity
deepened my understanding of taxonomy and sparked my curiosity about the
diverse forms of life in our environment.

NDBE Learning Cycle 6

In crafting an educational presentation on the differences between the 3-domain
and 5-kingdom schemes, the students get on a journey to facilitate a clearer
understanding of biological classification among their peers. Through collaborative
brainstorming sessions, they carefully planned how to effectively convey the nuances of
classification systems, ensuring the content would resonate with senior high school
students in the Philippines. Despite encountering challenges in finding local examples to
illustrate their points, the students remained determined to create a presentation

connecting global biological principles to the local context.

With the concept and structure in place, the students utilized digital tools such as
Canva to streamline the creation process and maintain organization within the group.
Each member contributed ideas and information, working together to ensure the
presentation was comprehensive and visually engaging. Despite the digital nature of their
collaboration, the students also decided to create a physical copy of their presentation
using Tarpapel (Tarpaulin made of paper), allowing for a tangible representation of their

hard work and dedication.

Ultimately, the students successfully developed an interactive presentation
highlighting the key differences between the classification schemes, incorporating
Filipino examples and references to make the content relatable to their audience. Their

collaborative efforts and innovative approach empowered their peers with a deeper


understanding of biological classification and its significance in contemporary biology

studies.

Figure 25 provides a detailed visual representation of the students actively
engaged in the project, employing the GRASPS framework to guide their learning
process. In the images, the students can collaborate, brainstorm ideas, conduct research,
and work on various aspects of the project. Some students are shown discussing ideas and
sharing insights, while others are seen conducting experiments, analyzing data, or
creating presentations. The photos capture the dynamic nature of the project-based
learning experience, highlighting the students’ active participation and the diverse range

of tasks involved in the project.

Note. During the brainstorming session, each participant presents their ideas on the key differences between
the 3-domain and 5-kingdom schemes. It's decided to continue the discussion on Messenger to focus and
organize tasks better. With collaborative efforts, the assigned task is completed. Ideas are pooled and
integrated to ensure the output reflects the collective vision comprehensively.


As supported by individual reflections, a student mentioned that investigating the
details of biological taxonomy becomes a journey of discovery, seeking to understand the
fundamental principles underpinning our understanding of living organisms. In this
reflective journey, the student explores their experiences in dissecting the differences
between the 3-domain and 5-kingdom classification schemes, culminating in creating an
educational presentation tailored for their peers. This introspective exploration dips into
the challenges faced, the collaborative efforts undertaken, and the insights gained

throughout this engaging learning endeavor.

NDBE-Student29: This task pushed me to think critically about biological
classification, especially the differences between the 3-domain and 5-kingdom
schemes. Collaborating with my peers for the biology fair presentation was both
fun and challenging, particularly when finding Filipino examples to relate to our
audience. Despite obstacles, using Canva helped us organize our ideas and create
a visually appealing output. Overall, this experience deepened my understanding
of classification and taught me valuable teamwork skills.

Post-intervention Phase

Initially, the research was designed to encompass seven learning cycles; the
curriculum was modified to six cycles due to adjustments in the school year calendar
mandated by the Department of Education. This alteration ensured alignment with the
educational framework while accommodating external scheduling changes. Despite the
condensed timeline, the core objectives and learning outcomes remained unchanged,

emphasizing the continuity and integrity of the educational program.

Following the completion of the intervention phase. students underwent posttest
assessments utilizing instruments such as the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI),

Mindset Theory Scale (MTS), and Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS). These


research instruments aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the implemented learning activities
and interventions, providing valuable feedback on students' comprehension and retention
of the subject matter. The administration of these assessments served as a crucial
component in assessing the impact of the educational intervention on student learning

outcomes.

Moreover, three focused group discussion (FGD) sessions were conducted,
involving a randomized selection of students from the Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE), Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and Non-Design-Based Biology Education
(NDBE) groups. These sessions facilitated qualitative exploration of students'
experiences, perspectives, and insights regarding the learning methodologies employed
throughout the intervention. Alongside these, students’ reflective journals were collected,

highlighting their significant learning and experiences during the intervention.

By gathering diverse viewpoints and firsthand accounts from students across
different instructional groups, the FGDs and student reflections offered valuable
qualitative data to complement the quantitative findings from the posttest assessments,

providing a comprehensive understanding of the educational intervention's impact.

Lastly, the researcher stayed in the school teaching until the fourth quarter after
the intervention, ensuring that students in the PBL and NDBE groups experienced the
learning activities conducted in the DBE group. This commitment to equity and fairness
upheld ethical standards in research, ensuring all participants had equal opportunities to

benefit from the intervention.


Data Analysis Procedure

In line with the current study's well-crafted design, a thorough mixed-methods
research approach was employed, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the
research problem. Consequently, quantitative and qualitative data were skillfully gathered

and analyzed to provide multifaceted insights.

The data analysis begins with a pretest administering the survey questionnaires
(FLARS, CFI, MTS, and TTS) to the three distinct sample groups (DBE, PBL, and
NDBE). To ensure the appropriateness of the subsequent statistical techniques, the
researchers first scrutinized the data for normality using Shapiro-Wilk’s test for
distribution. This essential step serves as the foundation for subsequent analyses.
Subsequently, Levene’s test for homogeneity of variances was employed, offering
insights into the initial comparability of the control (NDBE) and experimental (DBE and

PBL) groups in the present study.

The research intervention seamlessly commenced upon the conclusion of the
normality and homogeneity analyses. In the post-intervention phase, the same survey
questionnaires were administered to the three sample groups, paving the way for further
analyses. The foundation of the quantitative analysis rested on the application of one-way
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), allowing for the exploration of the intervention's effect
on students’ cognitive flexibility, transdisciplinary thinking, and growth mindset. For
statistically significant results, post-hoc analyses using Tukey’s HSD test were employed
to determine in which group the significance occurred. In parallel, simple linear
regression analyses were conducted to unravel potential relationships, particularly

whether transdisciplinary thinking significantly predicts the students’ cognitive flexibility


and growth mindset. Additionally, moderation analyses were employed to determine the
moderating effects of academic resilience on the independent and dependent variables

(IV to M and M to DV).

These statistical analyses were unfolded within the SPSS and Jamovi software,
ensuring precision and rigor in the research findings. To maintain the highest standards of
significance, all research hypotheses were analyzed at a significance level of .05. Figure
26 masterfully encapsulates the comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data analysis

procedures thoroughly orchestrated by the researcher.

All quantitative or qualitative data were diligently maintained in digital format to
ensure both security and ease of access. Quantitative data originating from survey
questionnaires were thoroughly transcribed into a Microsoft Excel file, and any physical
copies of the survey questionnaires were securely disposed of. Qualitative data, such as
audio recordings of focus group discussions, were transferred from the researcher's
mobile device in mp4 format to a dedicated laptop computer. Utilizing specialized
transcription software like MAXQDA, the researcher transcribed the focus group
discussions and stored them in PDF format. Additionally, all signed consent and assent
forms, the researcher's notes, students’ reflective journals, and any related artifacts were
scanned and converted into digital format. Following this process, all physical documents

were responsibly destroyed.

The digital files, including both audio recordings and PDF documents, were
safeguarded in a password-protected directory on the researcher's laptop. As an extra
precaution, redundant copies of all data files were created and stored on a secure flash
drive, which was then placed within a locked cabinet at the researcher's residence. This
multi-layered approach protects data against physical damage, unauthorized access,

tampering, loss, or theft.

PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA

This chapter presents and analyzes the results of this study aimed at assessing the
effects of teaching interventions on the cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and
transdisciplinary thinking of students engaged in Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE), Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and traditional Non-Design-Based Education
(NDBE) groups. Prior to the principal analysis, thorough data preparation and
preliminary analyses were conducted. Specifically, Shapiro-Wilk’s test was employed to
evaluate the normal distribution of the data. In contrast, Levene’s test was utilized to
ascertain the initial comparability of participants across the three groups based on mean

pretest ratings from the instruments employed.

The core objective of this chapter is to examine the impact of teaching
interventions on the variables mentioned above and to explore the potential moderating
effects of academic resilience on these relationships. To achieve this, a series of statistical
analyses were conducted. Initially, a one-way ANOVA was employed to detect
significant differences among the DBE, PBL, and NDBE groups post-intervention.
Subsequently, post-hoc analysis using Tukey’s HSD test was conducted to identify

specific group differences if significant differences were observed.

Furthermore. this chapter explores the relationship between transdisciplinary
thinking, cognitive flexibility, and growth mindset. Through simple linear regression

analyses, this research investigates whether transdisciplinary thinking positively predicts


cognitive flexibility and growth mindset among students. Additionally, the quantitative
data collected were complemented and enriched by qualitative data obtained through

thematic analysis of students’ reflections and transcripts from focus group discussions.

Lastly, the chapter seeks to interpret the complex interactions among academic
resilience, cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. By
analyzing the emergent framework derived from qualitative data sources, such as
students’ reflections and focus group discussions. Thus, this investigation aims to gain
deeper insights into the complex dynamics within the educational context examined in

this study.

Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) Approach and Cognitive Flexibility

To address the first research question in this study (Do students exposed to
Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), with empathizing phase, and Problem-Based
Learning (PBL), without empathizing, have better cognitive flexibility compared to those
subjected to conventional teaching (NDBE) in the following aspects: Alternatives, and
Control?), several analytical procedures were employed. Initially, the mean pretest scores
derived from the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI) were subjected to Shapiro-Wilk
normality tests to establish whether parametric or non-parametric tests would be used to
analyze the data further. Secondly, Levene’s test was used to determine the homogeneity
of variances across the DBE, PBL, and NDBE groups, thus establishing baseline
comparability. Similarly, a one-way analysis of variance was used to examine if the mean
pretest scores had significant differences prior to the intervention. Subsequently, the

mean posttest scores on the CFI were analyzed utilizing one-way analysis of variance


(ANOVA) to distinguish potential differences in cognitive flexibility among students

within the DBE, PBL, and NDBE instructional groups after the intervention.

Initial Comparability in Cognitive Flexibility

The data were evaluated using the Shapiro- Wilk normality test to establish
whether a parametric or non-parametric test would be used to analyze the data further.
Then, Levene’s test for homogeneity of variances was applied to verify if the groups
were initially comparable. When this assumption was met, the data were subjected to a
one-way analysis of variance to ascertain whether statistically significant differences
existed in the mean pretest scores for Cognitive Flexibility among students across three

instructional groups: DBE, PBL, and NDBE.

Table 19 provides a comprehensive overview of the descriptive statistical
measures concerning the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI) mean pretest scores. The
mean pretest scores for the DBE group (M = 3.71, SD = .499), the PBL group (M = 3.68,
SD = 428), and the NDBE group (M= 3.68, SD = .494) consistently reflected a tendency
toward the ‘somewhat agree’ response category on the 5-point Likert scale, as evidenced
by the mean ratings and corresponding standard deviation values. This outcome suggests
a prevailing perception among respondents within all groups that there exists room for

improvement in their cognitive flexibility concerning the learning of biology.

respectively; DBE, PBL, and NDBE represent groups exposed to the following teaching intervention
approaches — Design-Based Biology Education, Problem-Based Learning, and Conventional, respectively.

Since the study utilized small sample sizes for DBE (n = 49), PBL (n = 44), and
NDBE (n = 48) groups, determining their distributions was vital for choosing the
appropriate statistical method. So, the Shapiro-Wilk normality test was performed on the
data, the mean pretest ratings from the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI) and showed
no statistically significant results among DBE (W = .986, p = .817), PBL (W = .964, p=
-118), and NDBE (W = .962, p =.117) groups, respectively. Based on this outcome, the

primary researcher used parametric tests for data analyses (see Table 20).

Note. p = .05, normally distributed data has p > .05.

The mean pretest ratings underwent Levene's test of homogeneity of variance to

establish initial comparability. Then, a one-way analysis of variance established this

initial comparability of cognitive flexibility across the DBE, PBL, and NDBE

instructional groups. The resulting statistics indicated that the p-value of Levene’s test,

F(2, 138) = .507, p = .603, surpassed the predetermined significance threshold,

suggesting equality of variances among the three groups (DBE, PBL, and NDBE).

Consequently, since the assumption of Levene’s test was met, a one-way analysis of

variance was done to the data. It showed no statistically significant difference in mean

pretest ratings that emerged among the groups, F(2, 138) = .044, p = .957, indicating that

all students possessed comparable levels of cognitive flexibility prior to the intervention

(See Table 21).

Effects of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) Approach on Cognitive Flexibility
Students exposed to the experimental Design-Based Biology Education (DBE)
demonstrated a mean posttest rating of 4.25 (SD = .176). In contrast, those other groups
exposed to Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and conventional teaching (NDBE) displayed
mean posttest ratings of 4.14 (SD = .123) and 4.15 (SD = .154) on the Cognitive
Flexibility Inventory (CFI) (Refer to Table 22). Despite improving their respective mean
pretest ratings, the DBE group exhibited a notable shift in perception from ‘agree’ to
‘strongly agree’, suggesting a heightened cognitive flexibility compared to the PBL and
NDBE groups, which maintained similar levels of cognitive flexibility. This explains the
enhanced effectiveness of Design-Based Biology Education in fostering cognitive

flexibility among students.

To assess the comparative effectiveness of different teaching approaches in
enhancing cognitive flexibility among biology students, a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was conducted on the mean posttest ratings of the Cognitive Flexibility
Inventory (CFI). Preliminary assessments via Levene’s test on the pretest ratings of CFI
indicated homogeneity of variances across the groups, F(2, 138) = .507, p = .603).
Subsequent ANOVA results revealed a statistically significant difference in cognitive
flexibility among the three instructional groups, F(2, 138) = 7.889, p = .001) (See Table
23). These findings suggest that Design-Based Biology Education employs a positive
influence on the cognitive flexibility of biology students. Furthermore, the effect size (n?
= .103) indicates that approximately 10.3% of the variability in cognitive flexibility can
be attributed to the teaching approaches employed. This moderate effect size describes
the meaningful relationship between the independent teaching approaches and the

dependent variable of cognitive flexibility (Ferguson, 2009).

A post-hoc analysis using Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test
was conducted to determine significant differences among pairs of instructional groups.
The outcomes of the post-hoc comparison revealed that the mean posttest rating of the
Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI) for Design-Based Biology Education (DBE)
significantly differed from both the mean posttest ratings of Problem-Based Learning
(PBL) (M= .111, p = .002) and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE) (M=
.103, p = .003) groups (Table 24). These findings indicate that implementing the
experimental teaching approach, DBE, exerts a statistically positive influence on
students’ cognitive flexibility in biology, distinguishing it from the independent effects

observed in the PBL and NDBE groups.

This study aimed to compare the success of different teaching approaches in
enhancing cognitive flexibility among biology students. Specifically, it explored whether
Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) influences cognitive flexibility differently from
Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE)
methods. The hypothesis suggested that DBE would yield better improvements in

students’ cognitive flexibility in biology compared to PBL and NDBE.

The findings, derived from one-way ANOVA on posttest ratings of the Cognitive
Flexibility Inventory (CFI), revealed a significant difference in cognitive flexibility
among the instructional groups. Notably, the DBE group exhibited significantly higher
posttest ratings than the PBL and NDBE groups, indicating DBE's positive impact on
cognitive flexibility. This aligns with the hypothesis and highlights DBE's effectiveness

in fostering cognitive flexibility among biology students, an essential aspect of academic


success. Subsequent analysis with Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test
confirmed the distinctiveness of DBE's influence, further advocating for its integration

into biology education for meaningful improvements in cognitive flexibility.

The findings of this study are consistent with previous research that has explored
the effectiveness of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) in enhancing cognitive
flexibility among students. Several prior studies have demonstrated the positive impact of
design-based approaches on cognitive flexibility in various educational contexts,

including science and biology education.

For instance, previous research, such as that conducted by Terry et al. (2022), has
highlighted the efficacy of integrating design-based learning activities within biology
classrooms. This approach has been shown to foster notable enhancements in students’
cognitive flexibility, exemplified by their adeptness in generating diverse solutions to
complex problems. Additionally, findings from a study by Sugilar and Nuraida (2022)
pointed out the advantages of design-based instructional strategies. Students exposed to
these methods exhibited heightened adaptability and displayed improved creative
problem solving skills compared to their counterparts in conventional lecture-based
settings. What sets Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) apart from Problem-Based
Learning (PBL) and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE) is its emphasis on
integrating design principles throughout the learning process, thereby providing students
with unique opportunities to engage in creative exploration and innovative problem

solving approaches.

In this study, the cultivation of cognitive flexibility in biology education can be

attributed to implementing specific learning activities, particularly those integrating


design thinking principles. For example, students engaged in solving hypothetical
problems related to genetics, evolution, and taxonomy were guided through the distinct
stages of the design thinking process. By following this iterative approach, students were
provided with opportunities to enhance their cognitive flexibility, thereby advancing their
ability to generate innovative and adaptable solutions. Notably, including empathy as a
core component of design thinking is particularly impactful in biology education.
Through empathetic engagement, students learn to understand others’ perspectives,
enabling them to realize real-world problems' complexities better and relate to the needs
of diverse stakeholders. Consequently, solutions derived through this empathetic lens are
more tailored to address the vital needs of individuals, reflecting a deeper understanding

of their circumstances and requirements.

Furthermore, the current findings align with theoretical frameworks such as
constructivism and socio-cultural theory, emphasizing the importance of hands-on,
experiential learning in fostering cognitive flexibility and critical thinking skills.
According to these frameworks, learning experiences that engage students in active
exploration and problem-solving tasks promote the development of flexible thinking

patterns and adaptive cognitive strategies.

The findings are augmented by recurring themes identified through the analysis of
student journal entries, which are integral to this study. These themes include various
aspects conducive to enhancing cognitive flexibility, including adaptability to diverse
learning experiences, willingness to embrace challenges, appreciation for collaborative

problem solving, and a propensity for creative exploration. Table 25 presents excerpts


from student journal entries, illustrating their perspectives on how the teaching

intervention improved cognitive flexibility.

experiment with novel solutions and perspectives


The quantitative findings of the study, as revealed through a post-hoc analysis
using Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test, clarify the significant
differences in cognitive flexibility among instructional groups. Specifically, the mean
posttest rating of the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI) for Design-Based Biology
Education (DBE) was found to significantly differ from both Problem-Based Learning
(PBL) and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE) groups. This indicates that
implementing the experimental teaching approach, DBE, significantly influences
students’ cognitive flexibility in biology, setting it apart from the effects observed in the

PBL and NDBE groups.

To further elaborate on these results, the qualitative data collected from student
statements in their journal entries enrich the understanding of the cognitive flexibility
supported within the DBE approach. For instance, one student emphasized the
importance of thorough research and hands-on experimentation in understanding
complex topics like recombinant DNA. This echoes the quantitative finding by
showcasing how immersive, experiential learning environments, characteristic of DBE,
contribute to cognitive flexibility. Similarly, another student highlighted problem-solving
activities, including empathy, as instrumental in improving their ability to handle
challenges, especially in biology. This aligns with the quantitative result by
demonstrating how active engagement in problem-solving tasks fosters cognitive

flexibility, a skill fundamental for adapting to novel situations.

Moreover, student narratives emphasized the collaborative nature of learning
within the DBE setting. Working together on challenging genetic problems and

brainstorming as a group were cited as effective strategies for problem solving and


understanding complex concepts. This collaborative aspect resonates with the
quantitative finding, as collaboration and peer interaction stimulate cognitive flexibility
by exposing individuals to diverse perspectives and alternative problem solving

approaches.

Furthermore, qualitative explanations featured the importance of breaking
complex problems into manageable components, seeking diverse perspectives, and
considering various angles when facing challenges. These strategies align with the
quantitative result, as they reflect cognitive processes indicative of cognitive flexibility,

such as adaptability in problem solving and decision making.

Lastly, student reflection statements also highlighted the role of resilience and
seeking guidance in navigating challenges. While not directly measured in the
quantitative analysis, these qualitative insights hint at the psychological factors linked
with cognitive flexibility, such as emotional regulation and coping mechanisms,

contributing to overall adaptability.

In addition, students from the focus group discussion highlight DBE's
effectiveness in facilitating learning adjustment through its structured design thinking
approach. One participant highlights how DBE's structured approach facilitates rapid
comprehension of new concepts and effective problem solving, while another learner
emphasizes DBE's methodical breakdown of challenges and collaborative problem
solving. Moreover, collaborative problem solving enhances students’ adaptability to
diverse learning experiences, promoting a more comprehensive understanding of biology
concepts. Thus, these explanations provide compelling evidence supporting DBE's role in

enhancing students' adaptability and problem-solving abilities.


DBE-Student47: DBE, with its step-by-step approach, has been a game-changer
for me. Each stage, from empathizing to prototyping, has provided a roadmap for
absorbing new concepts rapidly. For example, when tasked with creating a
prototype for refining taxonomic classifications using DNA sequencing data,
DBE's structured process enabled me to swiftly comprehend various facets such
as ecological considerations, community involvement, and resource management.
And also, during our brainstorming sessions on enhancing pest resistance in
crops, DBE's structured approach facilitated quick adjustment by breaking down
the problem into manageable steps. By empathizing with the environment's needs
and synthesizing genetic concepts, I could swiftly adapt to new knowledge and
contribute effectively to our discussions.

DBE-Student26: This intervention made me adapt to new challenges by teaching

me to break down problems into smaller steps and approach them systematically.

By using the design thinking process, I learned to analyze problems from different

angles and collaborate with others to find solutions, which helped me overcome

obstacles and adapt to new challenges more effectively.

Several studies support the view that immersive, collaborative, and problem-
centered learning approaches, like Design-Based Biology Education (DBE). foster
cognitive flexibility in students. For instance, Sugilar and Nuraida (2022) found that
students engaged in design thinking in chemistry when solving a real-life problem
exhibited significantly higher cognitive flexibility levels than those in traditional lecture-
based learning environments. Apart from this, Terry et al. (2022) demonstrated a positive
correlation between participation in collaborative learning activities and cognitive
flexibility across various educational settings. Likewise, Sucu and Bedel (2021) showed
that collaborative problem solving tasks enhance cognitive flexibility in approaching
novel scientific challenges. In addition to this, Arnab et al. (2019), Geng et al. (2019),
and Wu et al. (2019) highlighted the effectiveness of immersive, hands-on learning

approaches, similar to those employed in DBE, in enhancing cognitive flexibility among

students in college. These studies collectively provide empirical support for the idea that


immersive, collaborative, and problem-centered learning approaches foster cognitive
flexibility in students, contributing to their ability to navigate diverse learning

experiences and challenges in biology.

For this reason, the qualitative data complement the quantitative findings by
providing insights into the cognitive processes and learning experiences that contribute to
cognitive flexibility within the DBE teaching approach. Together, these findings expound
the significance of immersive, collaborative, and problem-centered approaches in
nurturing cognitive flexibility, thereby enhancing students’ ability to adapt to diverse

learning experiences and challenges in biology.

Effects of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) Approach on the Components of
Cognitive Flexibility

To further explore the impact of design thinking on students' cognitive flexibility
in biology education, a one-way ANOVA was conducted on the mean posttest subratings
of the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI) components, specifically alternatives and
control. The results, detailed in Table 26, demonstrated significant differences among
students exposed to Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), Problem-Based Learning
(PBL), and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE) approaches in their abilities
to perceive diverse interpretations of life events and generate multiple solutions to
challenging situations (alternatives component). F(2, 138) = 4.106, p = .019, as well as in
their capacity to focus on an internal sense of managing difficulties (control component),
F(2, 138) = 4.185, p = .017. These findings indicate that the DBE approach effectively

enhances students’ ability to discern varied interpretations of life events, devising


multiple solutions for complex situations (alternatives), and their internal coping
mechanisms for managing difficulties (control), which are fundamental components of

cognitive flexibility.

The outcomes of the one-way ANOVA on the subratings of the Cognitive
Flexibility Inventory (CFI) components, specifically alternatives and control, offer
valuable insights into the influence of different teaching approaches on students’
cognitive flexibility in biology education. Significant differences were observed among

students exposed to Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), Problem-Based Learning


(PBL), and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE) approaches in their abilities

related to the alternatives and the control components.

The findings suggest that the DBE approach enhances students’ cognitive
flexibility in these dimensions. This assertion is supported by existing literature,
including studies by Cafias (2006), Feng et al. (2020), and Ionescu (2012), highlighting
the effectiveness of design-based learning activities in promoting cognitive flexibility and
problem-solving skills among students. The DBE approach likely facilitates students'
capacity to distinguish varied interpretations of life events and devise multiple solutions
for complex situations (alternatives component), as well as their ability to focus on an

internal sense of managing difficulties (control component).

The success of the DBE approach in enhancing cognitive flexibility in these
dimensions may be attributed to several factors inherent in the teaching intervention.
Incorporating design thinking processes, such as empathizing, defining the problem,
ideating, prototyping, and testing, likely provides students with structured frameworks for
approaching complex problems in biology. Furthermore, the iterative nature of design
thinking encourages experimentation and iteration, allowing students to explore various
possibilities and refine their solutions over time. Additionally, emphasizing empathy in
design thinking may enhance students’ ability to understand different perspectives and
consider diverse solutions to biological challenges (McLaughlin et al., 2022). Overall,
these findings highlight the importance of integrating design-based approaches into
biology education to foster cognitive flexibility, particularly in dimensions related to

alternatives and control.


Further examination of the significant differences observed in the alternatives and
control components of cognitive flexibility among students exposed to DBE, PBL, and
NDBE approaches reveals an understanding of the impact of these teaching methods on
students’ cognitive processes and problem-solving abilities in biology education. The
alternatives component, which pertains to the ability to perceive diverse interpretations of
life events and generate multiple solutions to challenging situations, is necessary for
students to adapt and thrive in dynamic learning environments. The findings indicate that
the DBE approach cultivates students’ capacity to think flexibly and creatively by
encouraging them to explore a range of perspectives and solutions when confronted with

complex biological concepts and problems.

Moreover, the significant differences observed in the control component highlight
the importance of internal coping mechanisms for managing difficulties in learning.
Students who can maintain focus and regulate their emotions and behaviors in the face of
challenges are better equipped to overcome obstacles and achieve academic success. The
results reveal that the DBE approach may foster greater resilience and self-efficacy
among students, enabling them to approach learning tasks with confidence and

perseverance.

Altogether, the findings feature the potential of design-based approaches to
transform biology education by promoting cognitive flexibility and empowering students
to become adaptive, creative problem-solvers. By leveraging the principles of design
thinking and fostering a supportive learning environment, educators can nurture students’
cognitive flexibility and equip them with the skills and mindset needed to thrive in the

ever-evolving field of biology.


Meanwhile, the study's findings resonate with recurring themes identified through

the analysis of student journal entries, which provide insights into their cognitive

flexibility development. These themes include divergent thinking and perspective shifting

for the ‘alternatives’ component and emotional regulation and adaptive coping
mechanisms for the ‘control’ component of cognitive flexibility. Table 27 presents
extracts from student journal entries, offering glimpses into their reflections on how the
teaching intervention facilitated cognitive flexibility development, notably regarding

components such as alternatives and control.

The quantitative analysis conducted in this study provides valuable insights into
the impact of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) on students’ cognitive flexibility,
mainly focusing on the components of alternatives and control. Through a one-way
ANOVA on the mean posttest subratings of the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI),
significant differences were observed among students exposed to DBE, Problem-Based
Learning (PBL), and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE) approaches. The
findings highlight that students undergoing DBE intervention exhibit heightened abilities
to perceive diverse interpretations of life events and generate multiple solutions for

challenging situations, reflecting divergent thinking and perspective-shifting aspects.

This significant result is evident in qualitative data where students emphasized the
effectiveness of collaborative brainstorming as a group and adopting an optimistic

outlook as strategies to overcome obstacles. Likewise, another student stresses the


importance of remaining composed under pressure, engaging in thoughtful decision
making, and seeking assistance for effective coping and problem solving. These findings
emphasize the value of DBE in fostering cognitive flexibility by promoting innovative

problem solving and flexible thinking strategies among students.

Existing literature further agrees with these findings by highlighting the positive
association between immersive, collaborative, and problem-centered learning approaches
and cognitive flexibility. Studies by Radnejad et al. (2021) and Volkova and Jakobsone
(2016) demonstrate that collaborative learning activities and problem-solving tasks
enhance cognitive flexibility in various educational settings. Moreover, Sohaib et al.
(2019) emphasize the effectiveness of hands-on learning approaches, parallel to DBE, in
fostering cognitive flexibility among students. These findings reinforce the thought that
the DBE approach enhances students' abilities to perceive diverse interpretations and
generate multiple solutions and promotes emotional regulation and adaptive coping

mechanisms, essential components of cognitive flexibility.

Altogether, this holistic approach to cognitive flexibility, encompassing both
cognitive and socio-emotional aspects, underlines the comprehensive nature of DBE in
preparing students to navigate complex learning environments and real-world challenges
effectively. By equipping students with these essential skills, DBE enhances academic
performance and fosters resilience and adaptability, crucial for success in today's rapidly

changing world.


Implications to Biology Education

The study's findings highlight the crucial transition from theory to practice in
biology education, offering actionable insights for educators and curriculum developers.
By systematically comparing the effectiveness of Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE), Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and Non-Design-Based Biology Education
(NDBE), this research illuminates the practical implications of integrating design-based
approaches into classroom instruction. The significant differences observed among
instructional groups accentuate the superiority of the DBE approach, particularly in

dimensions related to alternatives and control components of cognitive flexibility.

Practically, these findings suggest a tangible pathway for translating theoretical
frameworks, such as design thinking principles, into effective pedagogical practices in
biology education. Educators can leverage design-based approaches to guide students
through iterative problem solving processes, encouraging them to explore diverse
perspectives and generate innovative solutions to complex biological challenges. By
embedding empathy and collaboration into instructional strategies, educators can
cultivate students’ cognitive flexibility and equip them with the skills needed to thrive in

the dynamic field of biology education.

Furthermore, the insights gathered from this study inform the development of
curriculum designs and instructional methodologies to promote cognitive flexibility
among biology students. Educators can design learning activities that challenge students
to engage in divergent thinking and perspective shifting, fostering their ability to consider
multiple viewpoints and solutions. Additionally, opportunities for practicing emotional

regulation and adaptive coping mechanisms can be seamlessly integrated into


instructional practices, ensuring students are well-equipped to navigate the complexities

of academic and professional challenges in biology education.

In essence, this study points out the essential role of design-based approaches in
bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications in biology
education. By embracing the principles of design thinking and fostering supportive
learning environments, educators can empower students to become adaptive, creative
problem-solvers capable of addressing the multifaceted challenges inherent in the study
of biology. These insights provide actionable guidance for educators seeking to enhance
student engagement and achievement, facilitating a seamless transition from theoretical

foundations to real-world practice in biology education.

Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) Approach and Growth Mindset

In addressing the second research question of this study (Do students exposed to
Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), with empathizing phase, and Problem-Based
Learning (PBL), without empathizing, have a growth mindset compared to those
subjected to conventional teaching (NDBE) in the following aspects: belief in
improvement, efforts to emphasize a growth mindset, mutability of belief, and
determinations not to procrastinate?), various analytical methodologies were employed.
Initially, the mean pretest scores obtained from the Mindset Theory Scale (MTS)
underwent Shapiro-Wilk normality tests to determine the appropriate statistical approach
for further analysis. Subsequently, Levene’s test was utilized to assess the equality of
variances across the DBE, PBL, and NDBE groups, thereby establishing a foundational

comparability. Concurrently, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to


establish whether statistically significant differences existed in the pretest mean scores
prior to intervention. Furthermore, the mean posttest scores on the MTS were subjected
to one-way ANOVA to elucidate potential variations in growth mindset among students

within the DBE, PBL, and NDBE instructional modalities following the intervention.

Initial Comparability in Growth Mindset

The data was submitted to a Shapiro-Wilk normality test to assess the
distribution's normality, guiding the choice between parametric or non-parametric
analyses. Subsequently, Levene’s test for homogeneity of variances was conducted to
verify the initial comparability of groups. Upon meeting this assumption, a one-way
analysis of variance was employed to determine whether statistically significant
differences existed in mean pretest scores for Growth Mindset across instructional

groups: DBE, PBL, and NDBE.

Table 28 presents a detailed summary of descriptive statistics regarding pretest
mean scores from the Mindset Theory Scale (MTS). Notably, mean pretest scores for the
DBE (M = 3.77, SD = .552), PBL (M = 3.74, SD = .442), and NDBE (M = 3.83, SD=
.545) groups predominantly leaned toward the 'somewhat agree' category on the 5-point
Likert scale. This uniformity suggests a shared perception among respondents across all

groups that their growth mindset in biology learning could be enhanced.

Note. MTS maximum mean rating = 5.00; n, M, and SD represent sample size, mean, and standard
deviation, respectively; DBE, PBL, and NDBE represent groups exposed to the following teaching
intervention approaches — Design-Based Biology Education, Problem-Based Learning, and Conventional,
respectively.

Given the study's utilization of relatively small sample sizes for the DBE (n = 49),
PBL (n = 44), and NDBE (n = 48) groups, assessing their distributions became
imperative to select the appropriate statistical approach. Therefore, the Shapiro-Wilk
normality test was conducted on the dataset — the pretest mean ratings from the Mindset
Theory Scale (MTS), yielding non-significant results for the DBE (W = .973, p = .312),
PBL (W = .984, p = .788), and NDBE (W = .983, p = .723) groups, respectively.
Considering these findings, the primary researcher opted for parametric tests for

subsequent data analyses, as detailed in Table 29.

The mean pretest ratings were subjected to Levene's test of homogeneity of

variance to establish the initial comparability across instructional groups. Subsequently, a

one-way analysis of variance was employed to verify this initial comparability of growth

mindset among the DBE, PBL, and NDBE groups. The obtained statistics revealed that

the p-value of Levene’s test, F(2, 138) = 1.668, p = .192, exceeded the predetermined

significance threshold, indicating uniformity of variances among the three groups (DBE,

PBL, and NDBE). As such, with the assumption of Levene’s test being met, a one-way

analysis of variance was conducted on the data, revealing no statistically significant

difference in pretest mean ratings among the groups, F(2, 138) = .293, p = .747. This

suggests that all students exhibited comparable levels of growth mindset prior to the

intervention (Refer to Table 30).

Effects of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) Approach on Growth Mindset
Within the scope of biology education approaches, this study compared the
effectiveness of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), Problem-Based Learning
(PBL), and conventional teaching (NDBE). Analysis revealed that students exposed to
DBE exhibited a mean posttest rating of 4.30 (SD = 0.361) on the Mindset Theory Scale
(MTS), whereas those in the PBL and NDBE groups showed mean posttest ratings of
4.09 (SD = 0.352) and 4.08 (SD = 0.268), respectively (Refer to Table 31). While all
groups demonstrated improvements in pretest ratings, the DBE group notably
demonstrated a shift from ‘agree’ to ‘strongly agree,’ indicating significant growth mindset
development compared to the relatively stable mindset levels observed in the PBL and
NDBE groups. These findings highlight the distinct ability of Design-Based Biology
Education to foster a growth mindset among students, suggesting its potential superiority

over alternative pedagogical methods.

In order to evaluate the relative effectiveness of diverse pedagogical approaches
in cultivating a growth mindset among biology students, a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was conducted to analyze the mean posttest ratings derived from the Mindset
Theory Scale (MTS). Preliminary examination, facilitated by Levene’s test, confirmed
the homogeneity of variances across the groups, yielding a non-significant result, F(2,
138) = 1.668, p = .192. Subsequent ANOVA outcomes unveiled a statistically significant
difference in growth mindset among the instructional groups, with a noteworthy F-
statistic of F(2, 138) = 7.069, p = .001 (See Table 32). These discernments imply the
valuable influence of Design-Based Biology Education on reinforcing a growth mindset
in biology education. Moreover, the calculated effect size (n? = .093) signifies that
approximately 9.3% of the variance in growth mindset can be ascribed to the variations in

teaching approaches utilized. Such a moderate effect size substantiates the significant


association between the distinct instructional paradigms and the cognitive adaptability of

learners (Norouzian & Plonsky, 2018).

A subsequent examination employing Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference

(HSD) test was undertaken to set down noteworthy distinctions among pairs of

instructional approaches. The findings from this post-hoc analysis revealed significant

differences in the mean posttest ratings derived from the Mindset Theory Scale (MTS)

between Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) and both Problem-Based Learning

(PBL) (M = .211, p = .007) as well as Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE) (M

of the experimental pedagogical framework, DBE, on enhancing students’ growth


mindset in biology education, setting it apart from the distinct effects observed within the

PBL and NDBE instructional groups.

One of the objectives of this study was to assess the effectiveness of diverse
pedagogical approaches in fostering a growth mindset among students in biology
education. The central research question guiding this investigation was whether Design-
Based Biology Education (DBE) exerts a significant impact on the enhancement of
growth mindset compared to Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and conventional Non-
Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE). It was hypothesized that students exposed to
DBE would demonstrate significantly more improvements in growth mindset than their

counterparts in the PBL and NDBE groups.


The statistical analysis, conducted via a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
on the mean posttest ratings obtained from the Mindset Theory Scale (MTS), revealed
significant differences among the instructional groups. This finding supports DBE's
hypothesized influence in strengthening a growth mindset in biology education.
Additionally, a post-hoc analysis employing Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference
(HSD) test portrayed significant differences in mean posttest ratings between DBE and
both PBL and NDBE groups. These findings emphasize the distinctive effectiveness of
DBE in fostering growth mindset enhancements in biology education, setting it apart

from the effects observed in the alternative instructional paradigms.

The findings of this study align closely with existing research in educational
pedagogy and psychological theories of learning. Firstly, the observed efficacy of
Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) in enhancing growth mindset corroborates
previous studies emphasizing the importance of innovative and experiential learning
approaches in fostering growth mindset among students (Kapasi & Pei, 2022; Zhao et al.,
2021). These findings resonate with the principles of constructivism, which posits that
learners actively construct their understanding of the world through hands-on experiences
and interactions with their environment (Mcleod, 2024). By engaging students in iterative
design processes and real-world problem solving tasks, DBE aligns with constructivist
principles, thereby promoting deep conceptual understanding and a growth-oriented

mindset.

Furthermore, the differential effects observed between DBE and alternative
teaching approaches, such as Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Non-Design-Based

Biology Education (NDBE), are consistent with previous research highlighting the need


to move beyond traditional instructional paradigms toward more innovative and student-
centered approaches (Zintz, 2018). This notion is supported by social cognitive theories
of learning, particularly Bandura's concept of self-efficacy, which posits that individuals’
beliefs in their ability to succeed influence their motivation and performance (Bandura,
1977). By providing students with opportunities to engage in authentic, collaborative
problem solving tasks within a supportive learning environment, DBE may enhance
students’ self-efficacy beliefs, thus fostering a growth mindset and promoting academic

success.

In the same manner, the observed differences in growth mindset between DBE
and conventional teaching approaches align with prior research highlighting the
limitations of traditional instructional methods in promoting a growth mindset. Dweck
(2019) emphasized the importance of creating a supportive learning environment that
encourages students to embrace challenges and view failure as an opportunity for growth.
DBE's emphasis on hands-on, experiential learning and collaborative problem solving
tasks likely fosters such an environment, leading to the observed enhancements in growth

mindset.

Several key features in the DBE intervention likely contributed to its success in
enhancing the growth mindset among students. Firstly, the emphasis on hands-on,
experiential learning and integration of real-world problem solving tasks likely promoted
deeper engagement and conceptual understanding among students. Additionally, the
collaborative learning environment DBE fosters encourages peer interaction and
knowledge sharing, further enhancing students’ growth mindset and cognitive

adaptability. Furthermore, the iterative design process central to DBE encourages


students to embrace failure as an inherent aspect of learning, promoting resilience and a

positive attitude toward challenges.

On the whole, the findings of this study highlight the valuable influence of
Design-Based Biology Education in reinforcing a growth mindset in biology education.
By integrating innovative pedagogical approaches grounded in psychological theories of
learning, such as constructivism and social cognitive theory, educators can effectively
cultivate students’ mindset orientations toward learning and promote academic success.
Moving forward, continued exploration and integration of evidence-based instructional
strategies are warranted to optimize student learning outcomes and foster a positive

mindset toward learning in biology education.

To provide additional support on the results, the emergence of consistent themes
from the analysis of student journal entries conducted within the framework of this study
lends credence to the observed findings. These themes encapsulate various facets
conducive to cultivating a growth mindset, including embracing challenges, persistence
and resilience, positive self-talk and mindset reframing, collaboration and peer support,
reflection, and goal setting. Table 34 presents excerpts from student journal entries
explaining their perceptions regarding how the teaching intervention enhanced their
growth mindset. These qualitative insights complement the study's quantitative findings,
providing perspectives on the mechanisms through which instructional practices

contribute to student mindset development.

*This refers to the understanding or belief that one's beliefs, opinions, or perspectives are not fixed or
immutable but can change over time based on new information, experiences, or evidence. It encompasses
recognizing that individuals can reconsider and revise their beliefs in light of new knowledge or insights
This refers to avoiding or minimizing the tendency to delay or postpone tasks or responsibilities. It
involves taking proactive steps to address tasks promptly and efficiently, rather than putting them off until
later. Not procrastinating is often associated with effective time management and goal-setting strategies
‘This entails the conviction or mindset that individuals have the potential to improve their abilities, skills,
or circumstances through effort, perseverance, and learning. It reflects a positive outlook on personal
growth and development, emphasizing the belief that one's current capabilities are not fixed but can be
enhanced through deliberate practice and continuous learning

‘This refers to the intentional allocation of effort and energy toward cultivating a growth mindset, which is
characterized by the belief that intelligence, talents, and abilities can be developed through dedication and
hard work. Effort for a growth mindset involves adopting behaviors and attitudes that prioritize learning,
resilience, and perseverance in the face of challenges, setbacks, or failures. It encompasses the willingness
to embrace challenges, seek feedback, and persist in pursuing long-term goals

The study's quantitative findings explained through Tukey's Honestly Significant
Difference (HSD) test, offer compelling insights into the influence of different
instructional approaches on students’ growth mindsets in biology education. Specifically,
the results highlight significant differences in mean posttest ratings derived from the
Mindset Theory Scale (MTS) between the Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) group
and both Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Non-Design-Based Biology Education
(NDBE) groups. The statistically significant differences call attention to the notable
impact of the experimental pedagogical framework, DBE, in fostering a growth mindset
among students, setting it apart from the effects observed within the PBL and NDBE
instructional groups. This quantitative analysis is supported by the qualitative
observations regarding student mindset shifts brought about by engaging with different

instructional methods.


Qualitative data garnered from student reflective journal entries further enriches
the understanding of the observed changes in mindset. For instance, students exposed to
DBE noted a newfound openness to constructive criticism, reflecting an enhanced
receptivity to feedback and a willingness to embrace growth opportunities. This aligns
with the notion of "Mutability of Belief," wherein students exhibit a greater inclination
toward adaptability and interdisciplinary problem solving approaches, as evidenced by
their ability to draw upon various principles from biology, chemistry, genetics, and
bioinformatics to address challenges effectively. Such qualitative insights corroborate the
quantitative findings by illustrating how DBE facilitates the development of a growth-
oriented mindset characterized by resilience and a proactive attitude toward learning and

problem solving.

Moreover, students’ reflections on their class experiences illustrated their evolving
perspectives toward procrastination and their belief in improvement. Students
demonstrate a shift toward proactive behavior and a greater sense of agency in their
academic endeavors by articulating how they have become more conscientious in
managing time constraints and taking initiative in task planning. This resonates with the
"Not Procrastinating" theme, wherein students acknowledge the importance of
prioritizing tasks and actively engaging in learning to achieve desired outcomes.
Similarly, the "Belief in Improvement" theme is exemplified through students’
recognition of the iterative nature of learning and their commitment to continuous self-
improvement. These qualitative narratives complement the quantitative findings by
providing insights into the cognitive and behavioral dimensions of growth mindset

development in biology education.


Additionally, the focus group discussion of selected participants provides valuable
insights into how Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) positively influenced students’
mindset toward learning. One participant highlights the impact of the design thinking
process, emphasizing the shift toward viewing learning as a collaborative endeavor and
challenges as opportunities for personal growth. Similarly, another student reflects on
how DBE transformed its leaming approach by fostering a dynamic and engaging
environment, wherein challenges are no longer perceived as obstacles but as avenues for
development. Furthermore, a learner also stresses the importance of DBE's iterative
approach, which instills a belief in continuous improvement through project iterations,
reinforcing that growth stems from learning and adapting. Collectively, these transcripts
support the findings by illustrating how DBE nurtures a growth mindset among students,
encouraging collaboration, embracing challenges, and promoting ongoing development

and improvement in learning processes.

DBE-Student26: Through the design thinking process, I've learned to approach
learning as a collaborative effort and see challenges as opportunities for growth.

DBE-Student35: DBE transformed my approach to learning by making it a
dynamic, engaging process. Rather than viewing challenges as roadblocks, I now
see them as opportunities for growth.

DBE-Student47"DBE's iterative approach instilled in me a belief in continuous
improvement. Each iteration of our projects, whether it was refining a prototype
or revising a problem statement, reinforced the idea that growth comes from
learning and adapting.

The observed influence of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) on students’

growth mindset in biology education aligns with existing research in educational


psychology and cognitive science. For instance, a study by Kapasi and Pei (2022)
investigated the impact of mindset interventions on academic achievement and found that
students who were taught by encouraging efforts, embracing mistakes and celebrating
achievements, and providing constructive feedback exhibited greater motivation,
resilience, and academic performance than those with a fixed mindset. This study
supports the notion that pedagogical approaches emphasizing growth-oriented beliefs can
positively shape students' attitudes toward learning and problem solving, as evidenced by

the present study's findings.

Furthermore, research by Anderman and Gray (2015) point out the importance of
creating learning environments that promote a growth mindset. Their study demonstrated
that interventions to foster growth-oriented beliefs among students led to improved
academic achievement and reduced achievement gaps, particularly among students from
disadvantaged backgrounds. These findings resonate with the observed impact of DBE on
students’ mindset in the current study, suggesting that innovative instructional approaches

can mitigate barriers to learning and cultivate a culture of continuous improvement.

Moreover, the works of Dweck (2019) and Zhao et al. (2021) provide insights
into the role of culture in shaping students' mindsets and academic performance. Their
cross-cultural study revealed that students from cultures that value effort and
perseverance (e.g., Eastern cultures) tend to exhibit a more robust growth mindset and
outperform their counterparts from cultures that emphasize innate ability (e.g.. Western
cultures). This research highlights the contextual factors influencing mindset
development and underlines the need for culturally responsive pedagogical practices,

such as DBE, that promote a belief in improvement and effort.


Overall, integrating quantitative results with qualitative reflections offers a
comprehensive understanding of the impact of instructional approaches on students’
growth mindset in biology education. By triangulating empirical data with students' lived
experiences and perceptions, the study underlines the transformative potential of
pedagogical interventions, such as DBE, in fostering a mindset conducive to learning,
adaptability, and personal growth. Existing studies in educational psychology and
cognitive science further support these findings, emphasizing the pivotal role of
instructional strategies in shaping students' beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors toward

learning and problem solving.

Effects of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) Approach on the Components of
Growth Mindset

To further investigate the influence of design thinking on students’ growth
mindset in biology education, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed
to examine the mean posttest subratings of key components of the Mindset Theory Scale
(MTS). Specifically, the components examined included mutability of belief, not
procrastinating, belief in improvement, and effort for a growth mindset. The findings,
outlined in Table 35, unveiled noteworthy differences among students exposed to Design-
Based Biology Education (DBE), Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and Non-Design-

Based Biology Education (NDBE) approaches.

Significant differences were observed in students’ belief systems regarding the
malleability of perspectives, signifying a recognition that one's viewpoints are not fixed

but can evolve with the acquisition of new information or experiences (mutability of


belief component), F(2, 138) = 3.353, p = .0138. Moreover, variations were also evident
in students’ tendencies to actively circumvent procrastination and promptly engage with
tasks and responsibilities to bolster productivity (not procrastinating component), F(2,
138) = 3.711, p = .027. Additionally, distinctions emerged in students’ propensity to
foster a growth mindset actively, embracing development through diligent effort (effort
for growth mindset component), F(2, 138) = 4.077, p = .019. However, regarding beliefs
in personal growth attributed to effort and learning, thereby rejecting the notion of fixed
abilities (belief in improvement), no statistically significant difference was determined

among the instructional groups, F(2, 138) = 2.338, p = .100 (Table 35).

These findings suggest that the DBE approach effectively cultivates students’
cognitive frameworks wherein perspectives are perceived as adaptable, procrastination
tendencies are mitigated, and a proactive orientation toward growth mindset cultivation is
fostered through diligent effort. These outcomes elaborate the intrinsic alignment
between the DBE pedagogical framework and fundamental components of the growth
mindset, thereby highlighting its potential efficacy in promoting a growth mindset and

adaptive learning dispositions among biology students.

The present study aims to understand the influence of design thinking on the

growth mindset of students in biology education, utilizing a one-way analysis of variance

(ANOVA) to scrutinize the mean posttest subratings of pivotal components of the


Mindset Theory Scale (MTS). Through this analytical lens, encompassing mutability of
belief, not procrastinating, belief in improvement, and effort for growth mindset, notable
differences among students exposed to Design-Based Biology Education (DBE),
Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and Non-Design-Based Biology Education (NDBE)

approaches were revealed.

These findings are consistent with prior research indicating that pedagogical
strategies emphasizing active engagement and problem solving yield positive outcomes
in fostering a growth mindset among students (Kapasi & Pei, 2022). The observed
differences in students’ beliefs regarding the adaptability of perspectives and their
tendencies to avoid procrastination resonate with the principles of the growth mindset
theory proposed by Dweck (2019), which suggests that individuals with a growth mindset
are more likely to embrace challenges and persist in the face of setbacks. Moreover, the
absence of significant differences in beliefs related to personal growth attributed to effort
and learning aligns with previous studies suggesting that certain aspects of mindset may
be more resistant to change through instructional interventions (Anderman & Gray,
2015). Thus, these findings not only add to the growing body of evidence supporting the
effectiveness of student-centered and experiential learning approaches but also emphasize

the nature of mindset development within educational contexts.

To further expound upon these findings, it is imperative to consider the specific
components of the DBE intervention that likely contributed to its observed efficacy. The
emphasis on design thinking principles and experiential learning methodologies inherent
in DBE likely facilitated the cultivation of adaptive perspectives and proactive problem

solving dispositions among students. Moreover, the collaborative nature of DBE fosters


peer interaction and feedback exchange, nurturing a supportive learning environment
conducive to growth mindset development. Additionally, the iterative design process
central to DBE encourages students to embrace failure as an inherent aspect of learning,
fostering resilience and a positive attitude toward challenges (Guaman-Quintanilla et al.,
2022; McLaughlin et al., 2022). Jointly, these elements of the DBE intervention likely
played a pivotal role in cultivating a growth mindset among biology students, as

evidenced by the study's findings.

Several aspects of the teaching intervention likely contributed to the observed
outcomes. Firstly, integrating design thinking principles within the Design-Based
Biology Education (DBE) approach provided students with hands-on, experiential
learning opportunities. By engaging in iterative design processes and real-world problem
solving tasks, students were encouraged to adopt a growth mindset by viewing challenges
as opportunities for learning and improvement. Secondly, the collaborative nature of
DBE fostered peer interaction and knowledge sharing, creating a supportive learning
environment conducive to mindset development. Through collaborative problem solving
activities, students not only learned from each other but also received feedback and
encouragement, reinforcing the belief in collective improvement and the value of

perseverance (Geng et al., 2019).

Moreover, DBE's emphasis on reflection and goal setting encouraged students to
engage in metacognitive practices, fostering self-awareness and intentional learning. By
reflecting on their experiences and setting specific, measurable objectives, students could
identify areas for growth and track their progress over time, reinforcing a proactive

orientation toward mindset cultivation. Additionally, the iterative design process central


to DBE encouraged students to embrace failure as a natural part of the learning process.
By encouraging experimentation and risk-taking, DBE instilled resilience and a positive
attitude toward challenges, which are critical components of a growth mindset (Sohaib et

al., 2019).

The significant results observed in specific components of the growth mindset
within the teaching intervention are reinforced by theories of learning that emphasize the
transformative potential of active engagement and experiential learning. Social cognitive
theories, such as Bandura's social learning theory (1977), posit that individuals acquire
new behaviors and beliefs through observation, imitation, and reinforcement. In the study
context, the Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) approach may have provided
students with opportunities for active participation in authentic tasks, thereby facilitating
the internalization of growth-oriented beliefs. Additionally, constructivist theories, such
as Vygotsky's sociocultural theory (1978), highlight the importance of social interactions
and collaborative learning in cognitive development. The collaborative nature of DBE,
which fosters peer interaction and knowledge sharing, may have contributed to the
observed enhancements in growth mindset components related to adaptability,

productivity, and effort.

Moreover, situated learning theory suggests that learning occurs within authentic
contexts and social communities (Kapasi & Pei, 2022). By embedding learning activities
within real-world problem solving tasks, the DBE intervention likely facilitated the
transfer of mindset principles to students' everyday experiences, solidifying their growth

and adaptability beliefs. Overall, these theories of learning provide a theoretical


framework for understanding how the teaching intervention effectively promotes a

growth mindset among biology students.

On the contrary, the lack of significant results in the belief in the improvement
component of growth mindset within the teaching intervention could be attributed to
several factors. Firstly, the instructional strategies may have inadequately targeted this
specific aspect of mindset development, resulting in a lack of observable changes among
the instructional groups. Additionally, the short duration or intensity of the intervention
might not have provided sufficient opportunity for students to fully internalize their
beliefs in improvement. Individual differences among students, including prior
experiences and motivational factors, could have influenced mindset development
independently of the instructional interventions. Furthermore, limitations within the study
design, such as the measurement instrument's sensitivity and sample characteristics, may
have impacted the ability to detect significant differences. Addressing these
considerations in future research endeavors may yield a deeper understanding of the
dynamics underlying beliefs in improvement and the efficacy of instructional

interventions in fostering this growth mindset.

The lack of significant results in the belief in the improvement component of a
growth mindset within the teaching intervention may be understood through various
learning theories that shed light on the complexity of mindset development. Social
cognitive theories, such as Bandura's self-efficacy theory (1977), propose that
individuals' beliefs in their ability to succeed impact their motivation and behavior. If the
instructional strategies failed to adequately address students' self-efficacy beliefs

regarding effort and learning, it could have limited their impact on beliefs in


improvement. Additionally, cognitive apprenticeship theory suggests that learning occurs
through active engagement in authentic tasks within a supportive learning environment. If
the intervention did not effectively engage students in meaningful learning experiences or
provide appropriate support to develop beliefs in improvement, it might have hindered
mindset development (Jagannath et al., 2023). Moreover, the lack of significant results
could also be attributed to methodological constraints, such as the sensitivity of the
measurement instrument or sample characteristics, which may have influenced the ability
to detect changes in mindset. By considering these theories of learning, researchers can
gain deeper insights into the dynamics of beliefs in improvement and the effectiveness of

instructional interventions in fostering a growth mindset.

In brief, the study explains the impact of design thinking on students’ growth
mindset in biology education, revealing significant differences among instructional
approaches. These findings resonate with existing research emphasizing the importance
of active engagement and problem-solving strategies in fostering a growth mindset. The
observed enhancements in adaptability and productivity beliefs stress the effectiveness of
the Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) approach, which integrates design thinking
principles, collaboration, and reflection. However, the lack of significant differences in
beliefs related to improvement highlights the need for more targeted interventions. By
considering learning theories, such as Bandura's self-efficacy theory and cognitive
apprenticeship theory, researchers can gain insights into mindset development dynamics
and instructional efficacy. Addressing methodological constraints and refining
instructional strategies can further advance understanding of growth mindset promotion

in educational contexts.


Along with the previous discussion, the findings are reinforced by recurring
themes identified through the analysis of student journal entries in this study. These
themes encompass various aspects supportive of growth mindset components, including
adaptability, proactive time management, and resilience. Bits from students' journal
entries, illustrating their perceptions of how the teaching intervention facilitated growth

mindset improvement, are presented in Table 36.

The qualitative data from the study provides insightful narratives that enrich our
understanding of the components of the growth mindset identified in quantitative

analysis.

First, regarding adaptability, students highlighted their shift toward viewing
challenges as growth opportunities rather than daunting obstacles. For instance, DBE-
Student47 exemplifies this shift by describing how delving into complex topics like
recombinant DNA technology has led to a more analytical and systematic problem
solving approach. This narrative corroborates existing research by Dweck (2019), which
emphasizes embracing challenges as opportunities for growth, a feature of growth
mindset. Additionally, resilience emerges as another vital component, with students like
DBE-Student39 describing how they have cultivated a resilient mindset by breaking
down study sessions and utilizing diverse learning resources. This aligns with findings
from Zhao et al. (2021), who suggest that resilience is fostered when individuals view

setbacks as temporary and as opportunities for learning.

Second, proactive time management and an action-oriented mindset are essential
for a growth mindset. DBE-Student13's narrative illustrates a shift from procrastination
toward proactive time management, recognizing the importance of effective time

utilization in achieving academic success. Similarly, DBE-Student28's account


emphasizes the transition from passive participation to taking initiative in task planning,
reflecting an action-oriented mindset conducive to growth and development. This is
consistent with the research by Rhew et al. (2018), who argue that individuals with a
growth mindset are more likely to engage in proactive behaviors and take ownership of

their learning process.

Furthermore, the narratives expound on students' belief in improvement and their
efforts for growth. While resistance to fixed mindsets is evident, as seen in DBE-
Student24's mention of improved critical thinking skills, there is also a notable cognitive
shift toward embracing growth opportunities. DBE-Student22's reflection on the change
in note-taking behavior signifies an active effort toward improvement, aligning with the
notion that individuals with a growth mindset believe in the malleability of their abilities

and actively seek development opportunities (Dweck, 2019).

Lastly, diligent persistence and grit are integral components of a growth mindset.
DBE-Student37's narrative highlights the importance of trusting oneself and persisting
through challenges, indicative of a resilient and determined mindset. Similarly, DBE-
Student08's account emphasizes the role of openness to experimentation and alternative
solutions in enhancing problem-solving skills and learning experiences. This resonates
with the research by Zintz (2018), who argues that grit. characterized by perseverance

and passion for long-term goals, is a crucial predictor of success.

By and large, the qualitative data from this study provides a shade of insights into
the various components of a growth mindset among students participating in Design-
Based Biology Education (DBE). These narratives complement the quantitative findings,

offer rich contextual understanding, and illustrate the dynamic nature of mindset


development within educational settings. By aligning with existing research on growth
mindset, these narratives point out the importance of fostering adaptive, resilient,
proactive, and growth-oriented mindsets to facilitate academic success and lifelong

learning.

Implications to Biology Education

The implications of this study bridge theory and practice, offering actionable
insights for educators to enhance instructional strategies and cultivate a growth mindset
among biology students. Grounded in theoretical frameworks such as Dweck's growth
mindset theory and Bandura's social learning theory, the findings highlight the
transformative potential of integrating design-based approaches into biology education.
By leveraging design thinking principles within DBE, educators can create learning
environments that foster adaptive beliefs and behaviors, promoting resilience and a

positive attitude toward challenges (Bandura, 1977; Dweck, 2019).

From a practical standpoint, educators can translate these theoretical insights into
pedagogical practices by incorporating collaborative problem solving activities, reflective
exercises, and metacognitive strategies into their curriculum. By emphasizing iterative
design processes and encouraging students to view failure as a natural part of learning,
educators can cultivate growth mindset components such as adaptability, persistence, and

a belief in one's ability to improve (Jagannath et al., 2023; Sohaib et al., 2019).


Moreover, the collaborative nature of DBE provides opportunities for peer
interaction and feedback exchange, fostering a supportive learning environment

conducive to growth mindset development (Guaman-Quintanilla et al., 2022).

In due course, by aligning instructional practices with theoretical principles,
educators can empower students to adopt growth mindsets, equipping them with the
resilience and adaptive skills needed to navigate the complexities of biology education
and beyond. These theory-to-practice implications highlight the potential for
transformative change in biology classrooms, where students are encouraged to embrace

challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and cultivate a lifelong love for learning.

Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) Approach and Transdisciplinary Thinking
To address the third research question of this study regarding students’
transdisciplinary thinking across different instructional approaches (Do students exposed
to Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), with empathizing phase, and Problem-Based
Learning (PBL), without empathizing, have better transdisciplinary thinking compared to
those subjected to conventional teaching (NDBE) in the following aspects: Integrative,
Collaborative, and Inquiry-driven?), several analytical methods were utilized. Initially,
the mean pretest scores from the researcher-made Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale
(TTS) underwent Shapiro-Wilk normality tests to determine the appropriate statistical
approach. Subsequently, Levene’s test assessed variance equality among the DBE, PBL,
and NDBE groups, ensuring foundational comparability. Additionally, a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to identify any significant differences in

pretest mean scores before intervention. Moreover, mean posttest scores on the TTS


underwent one-way ANOVA to explore potential variations in transdisciplinary thinking
among students exposed to DBE, PBL, and NDBE instructional methods post-

intervention.

The dataset underwent a Shapiro-Wilk normality test to evaluate the normality of
the distribution, aiding in the decision between parametric and non-parametric analyses.
Following this, Levene’s test for homogeneity of variances was executed to confirm the
initial comparability of the groups. Once this assumption was met, a one-way analysis of
variance was utilized to assess whether statistically significant differences existed in
mean pretest scores for transdisciplinary thinking across instructional groups: DBE, PBL,

and NDBE.

Table 37 presents a comprehensive overview of descriptive statistics about pretest
mean scores derived from the Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS). Noteworthy, the
mean pretest ratings for the DBE (M = 3.37, SD = .370), PBL (M = 3.24, SD = .328), and
NDBE (M = 3.29, SD = .345) groups predominantly gravitated toward the ‘agree’
category on the 4-point Likert scale. This consistency of responses suggests a shared
perception among respondents in all groups regarding the potential for enhancing their

transdisciplinary thinking in learning biology concepts.

intervention approaches — Design-Based Biology Education, Problem-Based Learning, and Conventional,
respectively.

Given the study's reliance on relatively modest sample sizes for the DBE (n = 49),
PBL (n= 44), and NDBE (n = 48) groups, it was crucial to evaluate their distributions to
determine the appropriate statistical methodology. Consequently, the Shapiro-Wilk
normality test was administered on the dataset — specifically, the pretest mean ratings
sourced from the Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS). The outcomes yielded non-
significant results for the DBE (W = .963, p = .120), PBL (W = .968, p = .261), and
NDBE (W = .981, p = .640) groups, respectively. Given these results, the principal

investigator employed parametric tests for subsequent data analyses (Table 38).

The mean pretest ratings underwent Levene's test of homogeneity of variance to
establish initial comparability across instructional groups. Consequently, a one-way
analysis of variance was employed to validate this initial comparability of growth
mindset among the DBE, PBL, and NDBE groups. The resulting statistics indicated that
the p-value of Levene’s test, F(2, 138) = .512, p = .600, surpassed the predetermined
significance level, signifying uniformity of variances among the three groups (DBE,

PBL, and NDBE). With the assumption of Levene’s test being met, a one-way analysis of
variance was conducted on the data, revealing no statistically significant difference in
pretest mean ratings among the groups, F(2, 138) = 1.572, p = .211. This suggests that all
students demonstrated comparable levels of transdisciplinary thinking prior to the

intervention (Refer to Table 39).

Effects of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) Approach on Transdisciplinary
Thinking

In the investigation, students were subjected to various pedagogical approaches,
namely Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and
conventional teaching (NDBE). Their posttest scores on the Transdisciplinary Thinking
Scale (TTS) were analyzed, revealing mean ratings of 3.59 (SD = .244), 3.57 (SD = .220),
and 3.45 (SD = .238) for the DBE, PBL, and NDBE groups, respectively (see Table 40).
While all groups demonstrated improvement from their respective pretest scores, it is
noteworthy that the DBE group exhibited a particularly pronounced improvement in their
perception of transdisciplinary thinking abilities compared to the pretest, suggesting a
discernible augmentation in transdisciplinary thinking skills relative to the PBL and
NDBE groups. This finding highlights the heightened efficacy of Design-Based Biology

Education in cultivating transdisciplinary thinking capacities among students.

To evaluate the relative effectiveness of distinct pedagogical approaches in

enhancing transdisciplinary thinking among biology students, a one-way analysis of

variance (ANOVA) was undertaken, examining the mean posttest scores derived from the

Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS). Initial scrutiny, employing Levene’s test,

confirmed the homogeneity of variances across instructional groups based on pretest TTS

ratings, F(2, 138) = .512, p = .600). Subsequent ANOVA outcomes disclosed a

statistically significant difference in transdisciplinary thinking across the instructional

groups, F(2, 138) = 5.614, p = .005) (Refer to Table 41). These findings intimate a

marked differentiation among the instructional modalities, thereby suggesting a

constructive impact on the transdisciplinary cognitive aptitude of biology students.

Moreover, the effect size (n? = .075) shows that the pedagogical interventions employed

can elucidate approximately 7.5% of the variance observed in transdisciplinary thinking.


This moderate effect size emphasizes the substantive association between the
independent instructional methodologies and the dependent variable of transdisciplinary

cognition (Liu, 2022).

A subsequent post-hoc examination employing Tukey’s Honestly Significant
Difference (HSD) test was conducted to explain noteworthy distinctions among pairs of
instructional groups. The outcomes of this post-hoc analysis showed significant
differences in the mean posttest scores on the Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS)
between the DBE group and the NDBE group (M = .149, p = .006), as well as between
the PBL group and the NDBE group (M = .127, p = .029) (Refer to Table 42). These
findings elucidate that implementing the pedagogical methodologies, namely DBE and

PBL, engenders statistically discernible improvements in students’ transdisciplinary


thinking in biology, thereby distinguishing their effects from those observed in the

conventional instructional paradigm represented by the NDBE group.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the relative effectiveness of distinct
pedagogical approaches in fostering transdisciplinary thinking among biology students.
Specifically, the research question sought to determine whether there were significant
differences in transdisciplinary thinking among students exposed to Design-Based
Biology Education (DBE), Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and conventional teaching

(NDBE).

Based on prior literature suggesting the potential benefits of innovative

pedagogical methodologies such as DBE and PBL in promoting transdisciplinary


cognition (Budwig & Alexander, 2020; Tan, 2021), it was hypothesized that students
exposed to DBE and PBL would exhibit higher levels of transdisciplinary thinking

compared to those subjected to conventional teaching approach.

The results of the one-way ANOVA corroborated our hypothesis, revealing
statistically significant differences in transdisciplinary thinking among the instructional
groups. Specifically, post-hoc analyses demonstrated that students in the DBE and PBL
groups exhibited significantly higher mean posttest scores on the Transdisciplinary
Thinking Scale (TTS) than those in the NDBE group, indicative of their enhanced
transdisciplinary cognitive aptitude. This aligns with prior research indicating the
efficacy of DBE and PBL in fostering interdisciplinary understanding and problem-

solving skills (Quigley et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2018).

Moreover, the moderate effect size (n? = .075) observed in this study suggests that
approximately 7.5% of the variance in transdisciplinary thinking can be attributed to the
pedagogical interventions employed. While this effect size may appear modest, it
highlights the significant association between innovative instructional approaches and the
development of transdisciplinary thinking, as noted in the literature (Liu, 2022; Tasdemir

& Gazo, 2020).

Several factors within the teaching interventions likely contributed to the
observed outcomes. Firstly, both DBE and PBL are characterized by active, student-
centered learning approaches emphasizing collaborative problem solving and real-world
application of knowledge (Noel & Liu, 2017; Tawfik et al., 2021). By engaging students
in authentic, inquiry-based learning experiences, these methodologies promote critical

thinking, creativity, and the integration of knowledge across disciplines, thereby fostering


transdisciplinary thinking skills (Guaman-Quintanilla et al., 2022; McLaughlin et al.,

2022; Wang & Zhao, 2021).

Furthermore, the emphasis on project-based activities, interdisciplinary
discussions, and the integration of technology within DBE and PBL curricula facilitates
students’ exploration of complex issues from multiple perspectives, encouraging them to
transcend disciplinary boundaries and adopt a holistic approach to problem solving

(Alhazmi & Huang, 2020; Eddington et al., 2020).

Additionally, the scaffolding of learning experiences within DBE and PBL
frameworks, including guided inquiry, peer collaboration, and reflective practice,
cultivates metacognitive awareness and self-regulated learning behaviors, which are

essential facets of transdisciplinary thinking (Arnab et al., 2019; Geng et al., 2019).

In the same way, Social Learning Theory suggests that learning occurs through
observation, imitation, and social interaction (Bandura, 1977). The collaborative nature of
DBE and PBL pedagogies aligns with Social Learning Theory by providing opportunities
for students to learn from their peers, engage in collaborative problem solving activities,
and share their perspectives with others (Alhazmi & Huang, 2020; Radnejad et al., 2021).
By working together in groups and engaging in meaningful discussions, students in DBE
and PBL environments not only learn from their own experiences but also benefit from

their peers' collective knowledge and expertise.

Ultimately, the findings of this study attribute the importance of innovative
pedagogical approaches, ‘such as DBE and PBL, in promoting transdisciplinary thinking

among biology students. By embracing student-centered, inquiry-based learning


strategies and facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration, educators can effectively
cultivate the transdisciplinary competencies necessary for addressing complex real-world

challenges in biology.

As additional evidence, these findings are underpinned by recurring themes
identified through the analysis of student journal entries, which are integral components
of the study. Among these themes, first, students frequently articulated their experiences
of interdisciplinary connections, highlighting instances of synthesizing knowledge and
methodologies from disparate disciplines to tackle complex biological concepts.
Secondly, reflections on collaborative learning experiences were prevalent, with students
often emphasizing the value of engaging in discussions and group activities with peers
from diverse academic backgrounds, fostering enriched perspectives and novel insights.
Lastly, a recurrent motif centered on cultivating inquiry-driven approaches to learning,
wherein students expressed a heightened propensity toward curiosity, critical questioning,
and independent exploration when confronted with interdisciplinary challenges. These
themes collectively highlight the multifaceted nature of transdisciplinary thinking,
encompassing integrative synthesis, collaborative engagement, and inquiry-driven
exploration. Table 43 encapsulates excerpts from student journal entries, providing
illustrative glimpses into their perceptions regarding the efficacy of the teaching

intervention in enhancing their transdisciplinary thinking capacities.

Elaborating on the results, the quantitative findings of this study explain how
transdisciplinary thinking gains result from implementing different pedagogical
methodologies in biology education. Specifically, the subsequent post-hoc examination
employing Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test revealed significant
distinctions among pairs of instructional groups regarding their mean posttest scores on
the Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS). These results, as depicted in Table 40,
demonstrate that the instructional groups exposed to Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE) and Problem-Based Learning (PBL) exhibited statistically significant
improvements in transdisciplinary thinking compared to the group subjected to the
conventional instructional paradigm represented by the Non-DBE (NDBE) group. This
quantitative analysis is supported by the qualitative data collected from students’

reflections on their learning experiences.

Qualitative data from students in the DBE and PBL groups emphasized the
transformative impact of interdisciplinary connections on their problem-solving

approaches. For instance, students highlighted how engaging in evolution concept


discussions and collaborative activities facilitated the integration of insights from various
subjects, such as mathematics and physics, into their analyses. These qualitative
justifications align with the quantitative findings, indicating that instructional
methodologies emphasizing interdisciplinary connections, like DBE and PBL, foster
transdisciplinary thinking by enabling students to draw upon diverse knowledge domains

to tackle complex problems effectively.

Additionally, collaborative learning experiences emerged as a recurring theme in
students’ reflections, particularly in the DBE and PBL groups. Students reported that
collaborating with peers enabled them to leverage diverse viewpoints, leading to more
effective and efficient problem solving processes. This qualitative evidence resonates
with the quantitative results, suggesting that pedagogical approaches promoting
collaboration, such as DBE and PBL, contribute to enhanced transdisciplinary thinking
by encouraging students to consider multiple perspectives and approaches to problem

solving.

Furthermore, the inquiry-driven learning approaches embedded within DBE and
PBL were highlighted by students as instrumental in honing their critical thinking and
communication skills. By engaging in thorough problem analysis and considering
alternative solutions, students in these instructional groups developed strategies for
systematically tackling complex tasks. This qualitative insight complements the
quantitative findings, indicating that inquiry-driven approaches characteristic of DBE and
PBL foster transdisciplinary thinking by empowering students to approach problems with

adaptability and resourcefulness.


In the same manner, gaining additional support from the focus group discussion,
From the transcripts provided, it is evident that both Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE) and Problem-Based Learning (PBL) interventions have positively impacted
students' abilities to approach complex challenges in biology education. These qualitative
insights complement the quantitative findings of this study, which demonstrated
significant improvements in students’ transdisciplinary thinking following the

implementation of DBE and PBL methodologies.

Firstly, students in the DBE group highlighted how the intervention facilitated
their ability to break down complicated challenges into smaller, manageable tasks (DBE-
Student26). This aligns with the quantitative results indicating statistically discernible
improvements in transdisciplinary thinking among DBE students. Additionally, students
emphasized the collaborative nature of DBE, which enabled them to generate innovative
solutions through brainstorming and considering different perspectives (DBE-Student25,
DBE-Student48). This collaborative problem solving approach is consistent with existing
studies' findings on DBE's effectiveness in fostering critical thinking and interdisciplinary

connections.

DBE-Student26: The teaching intervention has influenced my ability to approach
complex and interconnected challenges by teaching me to break them down into
smaller, manageable tasks. Using the design thinking process, I've learned to
consider different perspectives and collaborate with others to address each aspect
of the challenge systematically. This approach has helped me understand the
interconnections between different tasks and develop effective strategies to tackle
them step by step.

DBE-Student25: This teaching intervention affected my ability to solve problems
and projects. It enhanced my problem-solving skills and creativity in developing
prototypes. It also helped me improve my analytical skills when understanding the
problems.


DBE-Student48: Jn the creation of graphics that included information with the
motive to inform people about the geologic time scale, we thought of creating a
specific material or medium to be used in order to input information that the
group wanted to include. Wherein at the end, the group had decided to create a
magazine instead of an Info-Graphics. The group finalized with this decision as
the group believed that a magazine can be entertaining to read at and at the same
time, being able to contain enough information regarding the history of evolution
in earth or geologic time scale.

Similarly, students in the PBL group discussed how the intervention promoted a
systematic and structured approach to problem solving (PBL-Student24, PBL-Student18).
This aligns with the quantitative results showing significant improvements in
transdisciplinary thinking among PBL students. Moreover, students highlighted the
holistic nature of PBL, which encouraged them to consider various factors and
interconnections when tackling challenges (PBL-Student33, PBL-Student37). These
qualitative accounts resonate with existing research on the efficacy of PBL in enhancing

transdisciplinary thinking and problem-solving skills in science education.

PBL-Student24: PBL using the scientific method has greatly enhanced my ability
to approach complex and interrelated challenges by promoting a systematic and
structured approach to problem solving. When faced with tasks such as creating a
sustainable community garden involving many interrelated aspects, PBL taught
me to analyze the problem as a whole, consider different factors, and explore the
interdisciplinary solutions by applying scientific principles and critical thinking
skills.

PBL-Student18: J take these challenges on a more step by step process. First by
figuring out the problem, what can be done, and secondly planning on how to do
it, and lastly executing the plan.

PBL-Student33: Specific instances where these teaching interventions have
influenced my problem-solving capacities in undertakings with numerous facets
comprise experiences like designing a renewable energy system for a


congregation or formulating a public health enterprise. In these projects, PBL
motivated me to cooperate with peers from diverse backgrounds, integrating
discernment from various domains to develop holistic keys. For instance, when
designing a renewable energy system, PBL provoked me to deem not only
technical feasibility but also economic viability and environmental consequences,
leading to a better comprehensive and endurable solution. These instances
exemplify how PBL has furnished me with the transdisciplinary thinking skills
essential to addressing multifaceted challenges creatively and effectively.

PBL-Student37: School project, these helps me on what step I should exactly take
first, identifying what is it that I want and the things I should do.

Moreover, both DBE and PBL interventions encouraged students to apply their
knowledge and skills to real-world scenarios, fostering a deeper understanding of
complex challenges (DBE-Student47, PBL-Student32). By engaging in authentic tasks
such as designing sustainable community gardens or renewable energy systems, students
could develop transdisciplinary solutions that addressed multiple facets of the problem.
This experiential learning approach is consistent with existing literature on the benefits of
inquiry-driven and project-based learning in promoting transdisciplinary thinking and

transferable skills.

DBE-Student47: While brainstorming solutions for integrating DNA sequencing
into taxonomy, DBE prompted us to consider diverse perspectives. For instance,
we explored the technical aspects of data analysis alongside the pedagogical
considerations of creating educational resources. This transdisciplinary approach
enriched our solutions and fostered a deeper understanding of the complex
challenges involved.

PBL-Student32: There are several examples of how these instructional initiatives
have improved my abilities to solve multifaceted challenges and tasks. One such
incident came during a joint engineering project in which we were entrusted with
developing a renewable energy system for a rural village. Using PBL principles,
we did significant research, examined the community's energy requirements and
resources, and had extensive stakeholder meetings. We used the scientific


approach to methodically examine alternative renewable energy solutions, taking
into account cost-effectiveness, environmental impact, and scalability. Through
iterative rounds of trial, feedback, and improvement, we eventually built a holistic
solution that included solar, wind, and biomass technologies to satisfy the
community's energy needs in a sustainable manner.

Several existing studies support the findings of this study regarding the
relationship between pedagogical methodologies and transdisciplinary thinking in
biology education. For example, a study by Tan (2021) investigated the impact of
problem-based learning (PBL) on students’ transdisciplinary thinking in a biology course.
The researchers found that students exposed to PBL demonstrated more significant
improvements in transdisciplinary thinking than those in traditional lecture-based
courses. This study aligns with the current findings, suggesting that instructional
approaches emphasizing active problem solving and collaboration, such as PBL, enhance

transdisciplinary thinking among biology students.

Moreover, research by Tawfik et al. (2021) explored the role of interdisciplinary
connections in promoting transdisciplinary thinking in science education. The study
revealed that students who engaged in interdisciplinary learning experiences exhibited
more significant transdisciplinary thinking, as evidenced by their ability to transfer
knowledge and skills across different domains. This supports the qualitative accounts
from this study, wherein students emphasized the importance of integrating insights from
various subjects, such as mathematics and physics, into their problem-solving

approaches.

Additionally, a meta-analysis conducted by Noel and Liu (2017) synthesized

findings from multiple studies examining the effects of inquiry-based learning (IBL) on


cognitive outcomes in science education. The meta-analysis revealed a positive
association between IBL interventions and improvements in students’ transdisciplinary
thinking, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. These findings corroborate the
qualitative insights from this study, suggesting that inquiry-driven approaches, such as
those employed in dynamic biology education (DBE) and PBL, contribute to enhanced

transdisciplinary thinking in biology education.

Overall, the synthesis of existing research underlines the significance of
pedagogical methodologies that emphasize interdisciplinary connections, collaborative
learning experiences, and inquiry-driven approaches in enhancing transdisciplinary
thinking among biology students. This present study contributes to this literature by
integrating quantitative findings with qualitative insights from focus group discussions,
which clarifies and explains how interventions like Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE) and Problem-Based Learning (PBL) influence students’ problem-solving
approaches and interdisciplinary connections. Together, these findings elaborate the
importance of active, experiential learning approaches in preparing students to tackle
complex challenges in biology and beyond, offering a comprehensive understanding of
the impact of innovative instructional practices on transdisciplinary thinking in biology

education.

Effects of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) Approach on the Components of
Transdisciplinary Thinking
In order to probe deeper into the influences of design thinking and problem-based

learning on students’ transdisciplinary thinking in biology education, a one-way analysis


of variance (ANOVA) was conducted, focusing on the subcomponents of the
Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS): integrative, collaborative, and inquiry-driven
facets. The ANOVA outcomes, outlined in Table 44, revealed statistically significant
differences among groups exposed to Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), Problem-
Based Learning (PBL), and conventional teaching approach (NDBE) concerning their
capacities to combine insights, methodologies, and concepts from diverse disciplines for
a comprehensive understanding of complex issues (integrative component), F(2, 138) =
3.667, p = .028; to engage with proficient individuals and stakeholders from varied
domains in collectively addressing complex difficulties (collaborative component), F(2,
138) = 7.402, p = .001; and to sustain an ongoing process of questioning, exploration, and
investigation into complicated phenomena (inquiry-driven component), F(2, 138) =
4.000, p = .020. These findings underline the effectiveness of DBE and PBL pedagogical
approaches in enhancing students’ proficiency in integrating insights, methodologies, and
concepts across disciplinary boundaries to achieve a holistic comprehension of complex
issues (integrative component), in fostering collaborative engagements with experts and
stakeholders from diverse domains to address complex challenges (collaborative
component) collectively, and in nurturing an outlook toward incessant inquiry,
exploration, and investigation into complex phenomena (inquiry-driven component)—

core components of transdisciplinary thinking.

The findings of this study align with existing research that emphasizes the

effectiveness of innovative pedagogical approaches, such as design-based education and

problem-based learning, in fostering transdisciplinary thinking among students. For

instance, Radnejad et al. (2021) conducted a meta-analysis examining the impact of

various instructional strategies on students’ transdisciplinary skills across multiple

disciplines, including biology. Their findings supported that pedagogical methods

emphasizing integrative problem solving, collaborative learning, and inquiry-driven


exploration contribute significantly to developing transdisciplinary thinking abilities.
Similarly, Liu (2022) conducted a longitudinal study investigating the effects of design-
based education on students' transdisciplinary thinking and found that students exposed to
design-based approaches demonstrated more significant improvements in their ability to
integrate knowledge from diverse domains compared to those in traditional instructional

settings.

Moreover, research in the field of biology education has consistently highlighted
the importance of fostering interdisciplinary connections, collaborative engagement, and
inquiry-driven learning to cultivate students' transdisciplinary thinking. For example, a
study by Guaman-Quintanilla et al. (2022) explored the impact of collaborative learning
experiences on undergraduate biology students' ability to integrate knowledge across
disciplines. Their findings stressed the value of collaborative problem solving activities in

promoting transdisciplinary thinking skills among students.

Furthermore, studies examining the effectiveness of problem-based learning in
biology education have consistently shown positive outcomes in fostering students’
critical thinking, collaborative skills, and ability to apply knowledge to real-world
contexts (Hendarwati et al., 2021; John & Thomas, 2018). Problem-based learning
encourages students to engage with complex problems actively, collaborate with peers,
and pursue inquiry-driven approaches to learning, all of which are central ideas of

transdisciplinary thinking.

The significant results observed between Design-Based Biology Education (DBE)
and Problem-Based Learning (PBL) may be attributed to several key steps embedded

within the teaching interventions. Firstly, both DBE and PBL methodologies prioritize


active learning approaches, wherein students are actively engaged in the learning process

through hands-on activities, inquiry-based investigations, and real-world problem solving
scenarios. This active engagement fosters deeper conceptual understanding and promotes
the integration of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries, aligning with the integrative
component of transdisciplinary thinking. Furthermore, DBE and PBL pedagogies often
incorporate authentic, real-world problems and scenarios, allowing students to apply their
knowledge in meaningful contexts. By contextualizing learning within authentic
scenarios, students are motivated to explore diverse perspectives, collaborate with peers,

and employ critical thinking skills to address complex challenges, thereby facilitating the

development of transdisciplinary thinking abilities.

Additionally, both DBE and PBL approaches emphasize collaborative learning
experiences, which may have contributed to the significant results observed. Through
collaborative activities, students can discuss, share perspectives, and co-construct
knowledge with their peers. Collaborative learning fosters the exchange of diverse
viewpoints, encourages students to consider alternative approaches, and promotes the
development of communication and teamwork skills—all essential components of
transdisciplinary thinking. Moreover, the collaborative nature of DBE and PBL
encourages students to draw upon the expertise of their peers, thereby broadening their
understanding of complex issues and enhancing their ability to engage with experts and
stakeholders from diverse domains, as highlighted in the collaborative component of
transdisciplinary thinking. Overall, the emphasis on active, inquiry-driven learning and

collaborative engagement within DBE and PBL interventions likely contributed to the


significant results observed in enhancing students’ transdisciplinary thinking abilities in

biology education.

Therefore, the findings of this study are consistent with existing literature

highlighting the efficacy of design-based education and problem-based learning in

enhancing students’ transdisciplinary thinking abilities. By corroborating these results
with prior research, this study contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the
importance of innovative pedagogical approaches in fostering interdisciplinary

competencies among students in the field of biology education.

To provide additional support, the study's findings corroborate recurrent themes
observed from the analysis of student journal entries, which are integral components of
the research endeavor. These themes capture vital aspects of each component of
transdisciplinary thinking. Firstly, students frequently articulate experiences about the
synthesis of multidisciplinary knowledge, demonstrating their adeptness at integrating
insights, methodologies, and concepts from various academic domains to address
complex issues comprehensively—an essential facet of the integrative component of
transdisciplinary thinking. Secondly, reflections on collaborative learning experiences are
prevalent among students, highlighting the value of engaging in interdisciplinary
dialogue and exchange and cooperative problem solving activities with peers from
diverse academic backgrounds. Such collaborative endeavors foster enriched
perspectives, cooperative problem solving, and the co-construction of knowledge, all
symbolic of the collaborative component of transdisciplinary thinking. Lastly, a recurrent
theme centers on the cultivation of curiosity-driven exploration and critical inquiry,

wherein students express a heightened propensity toward inquisitiveness, critical


questioning, and independent investigation—a manifestation of the inquiry-driven
component of transdisciplinary thinking. These themes collectively highlight the
multifaceted nature of transdisciplinary thinking and its cultivation within the educational
context. Table 45 summarizes excerpts from student journal entries, providing illustrative
glimpses into their perceptions regarding the efficacy of the teaching intervention in

Exploring on the deeper context of the findings, the ANOVA analysis indicated
significant differences among groups exposed to Design-Based Biology Education
(DBE), Problem-Based Learning (PBL), and conventional teaching approach (NDBE) in
terms of their capacities for transdisciplinary thinking. Specifically, the integrative
component, collaborative component, and inquiry-driven component of transdisciplinary
thinking were assessed. The findings revealed that DBE and PBL pedagogical approaches
were more effective in enhancing students’ proficiency in various aspects of

transdisciplinary thinking compared to the conventional teaching approach.

Firstly, the integrative component of transdisciplinary thinking, combining
insights, methodologies, and concepts from diverse disciplines for a comprehensive
understanding of complex issues, was significantly influenced by DBE and PBL. This is
consistent with qualitative data indicating that students exposed to these pedagogical
approaches demonstrated a synthesis of multidisciplinary knowledge. For example,
students reported breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and
collaborating with classmates from different subjects to gain valuable insights and

perspectives.

Secondly, the collaborative component, which pertains to engaging with
proficient individuals and stakeholders from varied domains in collectively addressing

complex difficulties, was significantly fostered by DBE and PBL. This aligns with


qualitative findings highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary dialogue and
exchange in collaborative learning experiences. Students expressed that collaborative
activities enabled them to draw connections between seemingly unrelated topics and

utilize diverse perspectives to approach challenges from multiple angles.

Lastly, the inquiry-driven component of transdisciplinary thinking, sustaining an
ongoing process of questioning, exploration, and investigation into complicated

evidence suggesting that students engaged in curiosity-driven exploration and critical
inquiry. They demonstrated a willingness to think critically, ask questions, and seek
assistance when encountering complicated problems, thereby enhancing their problem-

solving skills and reflective practice.

Accordingly, numerous existing studies support the findings that innovative
pedagogical approaches, such as Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) and Problem-
Based Learning (PBL), enhance students’ transdisciplinary thinking skills. For instance, a
study by Guaman-Quintanilla et al. (2022) and McLaughlin et al. (2022) investigated the
impact of DBE on students’ ability to integrate insights from various disciplines. The
researchers found that students exposed to DBE demonstrated higher levels of integrative
thinking, as evidenced by their ability to synthesize knowledge from biology,
mathematics. and other subjects to address complex biological problems. Similarly, a
meta-analysis conducted by Wang and Zhao (2021) examined the effects of PBL on
collaborative learning outcomes. The analysis revealed that students engaged in PBL

exhibited greater proficiency in collaborating with peers from diverse backgrounds to


solve complex problems, indicating the effectiveness of PBL in fostering collaborative

transdisciplinary skills.

Furthermore, the study by Quigley et al. (2019) explored the impact of
interdisciplinary dialogue and exchange on students' transdisciplinary thinking abilities.
Through in-depth interviews and observations, the researchers found that students who
participated in interdisciplinary discussions developed a deeper understanding of
complex issues by incorporating diverse perspectives into their problem-solving
processes. Additionally, a longitudinal study by Jurgena et al. (2018) investigated the
long-term effects of inquiry-driven learning approaches on students’ curiosity and critical
thinking skills. The study revealed that students exposed to inquiry-driven methods, such
as those employed in DBE and PBL, sustained higher levels of curiosity and engaged in
more reflective practices, contributing to their overall development of transdisciplinary
thinking abilities. Collectively, these studies provide robust evidence supporting the
efficacy of DBE and PBL in promoting various components of transdisciplinary thinking

among students.

These quantitative results are corroborated by existing studies in the field of
education, which have consistently shown the benefits of innovative pedagogical
approaches, such as DBE and PBL, in promoting transdisciplinary thinking among
students. By integrating quantitative and qualitative data insights, this study provides
comprehensive evidence of the effectiveness of DBE and PBL in fostering
transdisciplinary thinking skills, ultimately preparing students to tackle complex real-

world challenges in diverse domains.


Implications to Biology Education

The implications of this study to biology education translate theoretical insights
into practical applications, offering actionable steps for educators to enhance student
learning experiences. By integrating design-based and problem-based approaches, such
as Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) and Problem-Based Learning (PBL),
educators can bridge the gap between theory and practice, fostering transdisciplinary
thinking skills among students. These pedagogical methods prioritize active, inquiry-
driven learning experiences that engage students in collaborative problem solving and
real-world application of knowledge, aligning with the principles of constructivism and

sociocultural learning theory (Noel & Liu, 2017; Tawfik et al., 2021).

Furthermore, incorporating authentic interdisciplinary problems within DBE and
PBL curricula enables students to apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios,
facilitating knowledge transfer from the classroom to real-world contexts (Alhazmi &
Huang, 2020; Eddington et al., 2020). This shift from theory to practice is essential for
cultivating transdisciplinary competencies among students, as it encourages them to
explore complex issues from multiple perspectives and develop holistic problem solving
strategies. Moreover, by scaffolding learning experiences to include guided inquiry, peer
collaboration, and reflective practice, educators can empower students to take ownership
of their learning journey and develop essential metacognitive and self-regulated learning

skills (Arnab et al., 2019; Geng et al., 2019).

Additionally, the emphasis on interdisciplinary dialogue and exchange within
DBE and PBL frameworks facilitates meaningful interactions between students and

experts from diverse fields, promoting the exchange of ideas and the co-creation of


knowledge (Guaman-Quintanilla et al., 2022). This interaction between theory and
practice fosters a dynamic learning environment where students can engage in authentic,
experiential learning opportunities that prepare them for the complexities of the 21st-

century workforce.

Ultimately, by embracing innovative pedagogical approaches and bridging theory
with practice, educators can empower students to develop the transdisciplinary thinking

skills necessary to address the multifaceted challenges of the modern world.

Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) Approach and Academic Resilience

In exploring the fourth research question of this study— Does academic
resilience moderate the effects of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) on the
following skills: Cognitive flexibility, Growth mindset, and Transdisciplinary thinking? —
several analytical methodologies were applied. Initially, the mean pretest scores derived
from the Filipino Learners' Academic Resilience Scale (FLARS) underwent Shapiro-
Wilk normality tests to ascertain the appropriate statistical method for further analysis.
Subsequently, Levene’s test was employed to evaluate the equality of variances across
the DBE, PBL, and NDBE groups, thereby establishing a fundamental comparability. In
parallel, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to determine whether
statistically significant differences existed in the pretest mean scores before intervention.
Moreover, an examination of the mean posttest scores on the FLARS was not conducted,
focusing solely on the pretest data since this scale served as the instrument for the

moderating variable, academic resilience, in this investigation.


Initial Comparability in Academic Resilience

The dataset was submitted to thorough examination through a Shapiro-Wilk
normality test to examine the distribution for normality, facilitating the selection between
parametric and non-parametric analyses. Subsequently, Levene’s test for homogeneity of
variances was executed to validate the initial comparability of the groups. Upon meeting
this assumption, a one-way analysis of variance was employed to scrutinize whether
statistically significant differences existed in mean pretest scores for academic resilience

across instructional groups: DBE, PBL, and NDBE.

Table 46 comprehensively depicts descriptive statistics regarding mean pretest
scores from the Filipino Learners' Academic Resilience Scale (FLARS). It is notable that
the mean pretest ratings for the DBE (M = 3.34, SD = .331), PBL (M= 3.21, SD = .306),
and NDBE (M = 3.29, SD = .332) groups predominantly leaned toward the ‘agree’
category on the 4-point Likert scale. This uniformity of responses suggests a collective
perception among respondents across all groups, indicating a steadfast academic

resilience essential for overcoming challenges in the learning process.

respectively

As the study relied on relatively modest sample sizes for the DBE (n = 49), PBL
(n = 44), and NDBE (n = 48) groups, it was imperative to assess their distributions to
determine the appropriate statistical approach. Consequently, the Shapiro-Wilk normality
test was conducted on the dataset, specifically focusing on the pretest mean ratings
derived from the Filipino Learners’ Academic Resilience Scale (FLARS). The results
revealed non-significant outcomes for the DBE (W = .960, p = .097), PBL (W = .978, p=
.574), and NDBE (W = .944, p = .053) groups, respectively. Given these findings, the
principal investigator opted for parametric tests for subsequent data analyses, as defined

in Table 47.

The mean pretest ratings underwent assessment via Levene’s test of homogeneity

of variance to establish initial comparability across instructional groups. Subsequently, a

one-way analysis of variance was employed to affirm this initial comparability of

academic resilience among the DBE, PBL, and NDBE groups. The resulting statistics

indicated that the p-value of Levene’s test, F(2, 138) = .415, p = .661, exceeded the

predetermined significance level, indicating uniformity of variances among the three

groups (DBE, PBL, and NDBE). With the assumption of Levene’s test being met, a one-

way analysis of variance was performed on the data, revealing no statistically significant

difference in pretest mean ratings among the groups, F(2, 138) = 1.605, p = .205. This

suggests that all students exhibited comparable levels of academic resilience prior to the

intervention (Refer to Table 48).

Academic Resilience as a Moderator of Cognitive Flexibility, Growth Mindset, and
Transdisciplinary Thinking

This investigation explores the interaction among different variables via a
moderation test. Specifically, the study examines whether academic resilience may
influence the effects of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) on students’ cognitive
flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking within biology. Moreover, this
current research proposes the hypothesis that academic resilience plays a significant

moderating role in shaping the impacts of DBE as a predictor of the outcome variables.

Centering on the interaction between academic resilience and DBE concerning the
cognitive flexibility of biology students, Table 49 exhibits that both academic resilience
(B = 41.6, p< .001) and DBE (B = 50.7, p < .001) positively impacted students’ cognitive
flexibility. Furthermore, a noteworthy interaction surfaced between academic resilience

and DBE regarding cognitive flexibility (B = 14.5, p = .037). This suggests that students


with higher academic resilience, characterized by their ability to overcome challenges
and setbacks in educational settings, tend to demonstrate greater cognitive flexibility.
Similarly, students exposed to Design-Based Biology Education, which emphasizes
problem solving, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary approaches, also exhibited

enhanced cognitive flexibility.

Note: *p <.05, **p <.001

In particular, to examine the effects of DBE on students’ cognitive flexibility
across different levels of academic resilience, Table 50 illustrates that whether academic
resilience is low or high, a positive correlation between DBE and students’ cognitive
flexibility emerges, with coefficients of B = 34.7, p = .003, and B = 66.8, p < .001.
respectively. However, the strength of this relationship appears to be dependent upon the
moderating influence of academic resilience. This suggests that while DBE alone

positively influences cognitive flexibility, the degree of this influence seems to be shaped

by the level of academic resilience. This means that the impact of DBE on cognitive

flexibility is not uniform across all students but varies depending on their level of

resilience.

The results of this study reveal a complex interplay between academic resilience,

Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), and the cognitive flexibility of biology

students. Both academic resilience and DBE are significant contributors to students'

cognitive flexibility. Prior studies have consistently highlighted the positive impact of

academic resilience on various aspects of student learning and development (Bahrami et

al., 2017). Likewise, the current study extends this line of research by demonstrating that

academic resilience is also associated with enhanced cognitive flexibility among biology

students. This corroborates existing literature emphasizing the importance of resilience in


fostering adaptability and open-mindedness, which are essential components of cognitive

flexibility (Braem & Tobias, 2018).

Furthermore, the positive influence of DBE on cognitive flexibility aligns with
prior research highlighting the effectiveness of problem-based and interdisciplinary
learning approaches in promoting flexible thinking skills (Tan, 2021). By emphasizing
critical thinking, problem solving, and interdisciplinary collaboration, DBE provides
students with opportunities to explore complex biological concepts from multiple
perspectives, thereby fostering cognitive flexibility. This finding is consistent with
previous studies demonstrating the benefits of innovative teaching methodologies in
enhancing cognitive skills and academic achievement (Cajfias, 2006; Feng et al., 2020;

Ionescu, 2012).

Moreover, the effectiveness of DBE in promoting cognitive flexibility may be
attributed to several key components of the teaching intervention. The problem-solving
emphasis, interdisciplinary connections, collaborative learning environments, reflection,
and differentiated instruction likely facilitated the observed positive impacts of DBE on
cognitive flexibility. By providing students with opportunities to engage in authentic
problem solving tasks, explore interdisciplinary connections, collaborate with peers,
reflect on their learning processes, and receive personalized instruction, the teaching
intervention effectively nurtured students’ cognitive flexibility. Overall, these findings
contribute to understanding effective educational practices for promoting cognitive skills
and highlight the importance of resilience and innovative teaching methodologies in

enhancing student learning outcomes.


For the second outcome variable, which is a growth mindset, Table 51 displays
that both academic resilience (B = 44.7, p < .001) and DBE (B = 21.5, p = .025)
positively impacted students’ growth mindset. However, a remarkably significant
negative interaction appeared between academic resilience and DBE regarding growth
mindset (B = -16.3, p = .043). It implies that as biology students exhibit higher levels of
academic resilience, the benefits of Design-Based Biology Education in fostering a

growth mindset become less pronounced or may even decline.

Table 51

Predictor* Moderator ~.163 .081 -2.02 .043*

Note: *p <.05, **p <.001

Additionally, to investigate DBE's effects on students’ growth mindset across
varying levels of academic resilience, Table 52 reveals that a significant positive
correlation between DBE and students’ growth mindset is evident when academic
resilience is low (B = 35.4. p < .001). However, as levels of academic resilience increase,
no significant correlation between DBE and students' growth mindset emerges (B = 7.6, p

= .582). This means that when students have low academic resilience, Design-Based


Biology Education (DBE) positively influences their growth mindset. However, as
students’ academic resilience increases, the effect of DBE on their growth mindset
diminishes and becomes statistically insignificant. In other words, the impact of DBE on
students' growth mindset varies depending on their level of academic resilience, with a

more substantial effect observed among students with lower resilience levels.

Note: *p < .05, **p <.001, shows the effect of the predictor [DBE (Predictor)] on the dependent variable
[MTS (Outcome)] at different levels of the moderator [Academic Resilience (M)]

The outcomes from the study provide valuable insights into the complex
relationship between academic resilience, Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), and
students’ growth mindset. Firstly, both academic resilience and DBE demonstrate
significant positive impacts on students! growth mindset, corroborating existing research
in educational psychology (Jowkar et al., 2014; Romano et al., 2021; Shakarami et al.,

2018). Academic resilience, characterized by students' ability to overcome challenges,


and DBE, emphasizing problem solving and critical thinking, are shown to contribute to

developing a growth mindset among biology students.

However, the most intriguing finding is the significant negative interaction
between academic resilience and DBE concerning growth mindset. This suggests that as
students exhibit higher levels of academic resilience, the benefits of DBE in fostering a
growth mindset become less pronounced or even decline. This finding aligns with studies
highlighting the nature of educational interventions and the importance of considering
individual differences in their effectiveness (Hayat et al., 2021; Turan, 2021). It suggests
that students with high academic resilience may already possess attributes associated with
a growth mindset, making them less responsive to the additional benefits offered by

DBE.

Further analysis of the effects of DBE across varying levels of academic
resilience emphasizes the complexity of this relationship. While a significant positive
correlation between DBE and growth mindset is evident among students with low
academic resilience, this relationship becomes nonsignificant as levels of academic
resilience increase. This suggests that the impact of DBE on students’ growth mindset
varies depending on their level of academic resilience, with a stronger effect observed

among students with lower resilience levels.

Notably, the teaching intervention likely incorporated several key components
that contributed to the observed impacts on students' growth mindset. Firstly, Design-
Based Biology Education (DBE) likely employed problem-solving activities, critical
thinking exercises, and interdisciplinary approaches, allowing students to engage deeply

with complex biological concepts and develop a flexible mindset toward learning.


Additionally, the intervention may have fostered a supportive and collaborative learning
environment, encouraging students to explore ideas, challenge assumptions, and learn
from each other's perspectives. Moreover, targeted strategies to enhance academic
resilience, such as promoting self-efficacy, goal-setting, and coping skills, may have been
integrated into the intervention, equipping students with the tools to overcome
educational challenges and persevere in the face of setbacks. By combining innovative
teaching methodologies with a focus on resilience-building, the intervention effectively
nurtured students’ growth mindset and fostered a positive learning culture in the biology

classroom.

For the third and last outcome variable, which is transdisciplinary thinking, Table
53 reveals that both academic resilience (B = 79.9, p < .001) and Design-Based Biology
Education (DBE) (B = 58.3, p = .025) had positive effects on students’ transdisciplinary
thinking. Notably, a significant positive interaction was observed between academic
resilience and DBE concerning transdisciplinary thinking (B = 17.4, p = .018). The
significant positive interaction suggests that as students’ academic resilience increases,
the positive impact of Design-Based Biology Education on transdisciplinary thinking is

also strengthened.

Note: *p <.05, **p <.001

As an additional, to investigate the effects of DBE on students’ transdisciplinary
thinking across varying levels of academic resilience, Table 54 reveals that a significant
positive correlation between DBE and students’ transdisciplinary thinking is evident
when academic resilience is both low and high, B = 93.7, p < .001 and B= 58.1, p< .001,
respectively. This indicates that Design-Based Biology Education positively influences

students' transdisciplinary thinking regardless of their level of academic resilience.

The study's findings illuminate the relationship between academic resilience,
Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), and students’ transdisciplinary thinking. Both
academic resilience and DBE exhibit significant positive impacts on students’
transdisciplinary thinking, consistent with previous research emphasizing resilience and
innovative teaching methodologies' role in enhancing cognitive skills and academic
success (Jurgena et al., 2018; Orozco-Messana et al., 2020). The significant positive
interaction observed between academic resilience and DBE regarding transdisciplinary
thinking suggests a synergistic effect, indicating that as students' academic resilience
increases, the positive impact of DBE on transdisciplinary thinking is strengthened. This
stresses the complementary nature of resilience-building and innovative teaching
approaches in fostering students' cognitive development and adaptability, highlighting the

importance of integrating both elements into biology education curricula.


Furthermore, additional analysis examining the effects of DBE on students’
transdisciplinary thinking across varying levels of academic resilience reaffirms DBE's
effectiveness in promoting transdisciplinary thinking regardless of students’ initial
resilience levels. This suggests that DBE's benefits extend beyond traditional educational
boundaries and are not contingent on students’ resilience levels. These insights have
implications for educators and policymakers seeking to design effective interventions to
nurture students’ transdisciplinary thinking skills, emphasizing the need for a holistic
approach that integrates resilience-building strategies with innovative teaching

methodologies in biology education.

To elaborate these results further, the teaching intervention likely incorporated
several key components that contributed to the observed impacts on students’
transdisciplinary thinking. Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) likely involved
immersive problem solving tasks, critical thinking exercises, and interdisciplinary
projects encouraging students to explore complex biological concepts from multiple
perspectives. Additionally, the intervention likely fostered a collaborative and supportive
learning environment, where students were encouraged to engage in open discussions,
share ideas, and collaborate on projects, thus promoting a sense of collective ownership
over their learning process. Moreover, targeted strategies to enhance academic resilience,
such as promoting self-efficacy, goal-setting, and coping skills, may have been integrated

and adapting to new learning experiences

*This theme explores whether engaging in DBE activities fosters academic resilience, which, in turn,
promotes a growth mindset among students by encouraging them to embrace challenges, persist in the face
of setbacks, and believe in their ability to improve


‘This theme explores whether students with higher levels of academic resilience are better able to engage
with the interdisciplinary nature of DBE, thereby enhancing their transdisciplinary thinking skills.
Additionally, it considers how academic resilience may buffer the impact of challenges encountered during
DBE activities, allowing students to maintain focus and adaptability in navigating complex, cross-
disciplinary problems.

The qualitative insights provided by students in the study offer valuable context to
enrich the quantitative findings regarding the impact of academic resilience and Design-
Based Biology Education (DBE) on cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and

transdisciplinary thinking.

When examining the observed interactions on cognitive flexibility, students’
reflections highlight the critical role of resilience in shaping their adaptive thinking skills.
For instance, one student emphasized how bouncing back from challenges influences
their flexibility in facing new academic tasks. This sentiment was echoed by others who
highlighted the importance of resilience and adaptability in navigating novel situations

encountered in teaching and learning environments. These qualitative accounts align with

the quantitative results, indicating a positive impact of academic resilience and DBE on
cognitive flexibility, emphasizing the interplay between individual resilience traits and

educational experiences in fostering adaptive thinking.

Similarly, the qualitative excerpts on growth mindset provide valuable insights
into how students perceive the relationship between resilience, learning opportunities,
and personal development. Students described how resilience to adversity influences their
approach to learning, encouraging them to view challenges as opportunities for growth
rather than barriers to success. This positive outlook, characterized by a willingness to

overcome obstacles and experiment with problem-solving strategies, resonates with the


quantitative findings, indicating a positive impact of academic resilience and DBE on a
growth mindset. However, the noteworthy negative interaction between academic
resilience and DBE suggests a dynamic condition wherein the benefits of DBE in

fostering a growth mindset may diminish as students exhibit higher levels of resilience.

Lastly, the qualitative accounts related to transdisciplinary thinking elaborate on
how resilience influences students’ approach to learning and problem solving across
diverse disciplines. Students articulated how bouncing back from challenges enables
them to synthesize insights from different subjects, fostering a more comprehensive and
innovative approach to tackling complex problems. These qualitative narratives
complement the quantitative findings, indicating a positive impact of academic resilience
and DBE on transdisciplinary thinking. Moreover, the observed positive interaction
between academic resilience and DBE highlights the synergistic effect of these factors in

promoting transdisciplinary thinking skills among students.

As explained and influenced by the teaching intervention, Design-Based Biology
Education (DBE) plays a crucial role in contributing to the observed impacts on cognitive
flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking, as clarified by both

quantitative results and qualitative insights from students.

Firstly, DBE emphasizes problem solving, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary
approaches, providing students with opportunities to engage in authentic, real-world
challenges within the context of biology education. Through hands-on activities,
collaborative projects, and inquiry-based learning experiences, DBE fosters an
environment where students can explore complex problems from multiple perspectives

and draw connections between different subject areas.


Additionally, regarding cognitive flexibility, DBE exposes students to diverse
problem-solving scenarios that require them to adapt their thinking and approach based
on the context of the task. By engaging in open-ended inquiries and design challenges,
students develop the ability to consider alternative solutions, experiment with different
strategies, and approach problems from various angles. This iterative problem solving
process cultivates cognitive flexibility as students learn to navigate ambiguity, tolerate

uncertainty, and revise their approaches based on feedback and new information.

Similarly, DBE contributes to developing a growth mindset by instilling in
students the belief that intelligence and abilities can be developed through effort,
perseverance, and resilience. Through the iterative design process inherent in DBE,
students learn to embrace failure as a natural part of learning and view setbacks as
opportunities for growth rather than reasons for discouragement. By providing a
supportive learning environment where risk-taking is encouraged, and mistakes are
viewed as learning opportunities, DBE fosters a culture of continuous improvement and

self-efficacy among students.

Moreover, DBE promotes transdisciplinary thinking by integrating concepts and
methodologies from diverse disciplines, such as biology, engineering, and mathematics,
to address complex real-world problems. By engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations
and drawing upon knowledge from multiple subject areas, students learn to recognize and
appreciate the interconnectedness of different fields of study. This holistic approach to
learning encourages students to apply insights and perspectives from various disciplines
to develop innovative solutions to complex problems, thereby fostering transdisciplinary

thinking skills.


In addition to the quantitative findings indicating the positive impact of Design-
Based Biology Education (DBE) and the moderation of academic resilience on students’
cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking, the results of focus
group discussions provide further support for the observed significant interactions
between DBE and academic resilience. These qualitative insights offer valuable
contextual information and perspectives on how DBE and academic resilience intersect to
foster adaptive learning skills and interdisciplinary thinking among students. By
exploring participants’ experiences and perceptions, the focus group discussions explain
the mechanisms through which DBE and academic resilience synergistically contribute to
enhancing students' cognitive, affective, and metacognitive dimensions of learning.
Through thematic analysis of the focus group responses, themes such as resilience in the
face of challenges, adaptive problem solving strategies, and interdisciplinary
sensemaking emerged, providing rich qualitative evidence to complement and enrich the
study's quantitative findings. Here are the sample extracts from the focus group

discussions.

DBE-Student26: / think academic resilience does influence the relationship
between DBE and my ability to adapt to different learning strategies. For
instance, when faced with challenging biology concepts, my resilience helps me
persevere through difficulties and try different approaches, such as using the
design thinking process. This allows me to adapt to new learning strategies and
overcome obstacles, ultimately improving my understanding and performance in

deeper understanding on how one matter affects the other, and if a student has
better academic resiliency, they could have deeper understanding of the
correlation of different matters. [Interactions of DBE and Academic Resilience on
Transdisciplinary Thinking]

Conversely, the responses provided by DBE-Student26, DBE-Student47, and
DBE-Student48 elaborate on the complex interaction between Design-Based Biology

Education (DBE), academic resilience, and key cognitive attributes.

DBE-Student26 illustrates how academic resilience influences adaptability to
different learning strategies, particularly when confronted with challenging biology
concepts. By persevering through difficulties and experimenting with various approaches
like the design thinking process, students can effectively overcome obstacles, thereby
enhancing their cognitive flexibility. This highlights the focal role of resilience in
fostering a dynamic learning environment where students can thrive by embracing

diverse problem solving methods.

Moreover, DBE-Student47 and DBE-Student48 highlight the complementary
nature of personal determination, DBE, and academic resilience in shaping students’
attitudes and approaches to learning. DBE-Student47 emphasizes how personal
determination synergizes with DBE's supportive environment to cultivate a resilient
mindset conducive to embracing challenges and pursuing excellence. This resonates with
DBE-Student48's perspective on how academic resilience fosters empathy toward

complex problems, enabling students to grasp the interconnectedness of various concepts


and develop a deeper understanding of transdisciplinary thinking. Together, these insights
highlight the multifaceted impact of DBE and academic resilience on cognitive processes,
emphasizing the importance of fostering resilience in educational settings to promote

holistic student development.

Several existing studies support the findings of the present study regarding the
impact of Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) on students’ cognitive flexibility,
growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. These studies offer additional evidence to
corroborate the observed outcomes and shed light on how DBE contributes to these

positive effects.

Firstly, research in educational psychology has highlighted the importance of
problem-based and inquiry-based learning approaches, which are central components of
DBE, in fostering cognitive flexibility. For example, a study by Sugilar and Nuraida
(2022) demonstrated that problem-solving tasks requiring students to consider multiple
perspectives and generate creative solutions can enhance cognitive flexibility by
encouraging learners to adapt their thinking strategies to novel situations. Similarly,
Hmelo-Silver and Eberbach (2012) found that inquiry-based learning environments
promote cognitive flexibility by encouraging students to explore alternative hypotheses

and engage in metacognitive reflection on their problem-solving processes.

Moreover, studies on educational growth mindset interventions have shown that
teaching approaches emphasizing effort, perseverance, and resilience, such as those
embedded in DBE, can positively impact students’ beliefs about intelligence and learning.
Dweck's seminal work on mindset theory (2019) revealed that students who are taught to

adopt a growth mindset exhibit greater motivation, resilience, and academic achievement


compared to those with a fixed mindset. Similarly, Anderman and Gray (2015)
demonstrated that interventions to promote a growth mindset can improve students’

academic performance and attitudes toward learning.

Additionally, research on interdisciplinary education supports the notion that
exposure to diverse disciplinary perspectives, as facilitated by DBE, can enhance
students’ transdisciplinary thinking skills. Budwig and Alexander (2020) argued that
interdisciplinary approaches to education encourage students to make connections across
different knowledge domains, fostering a more holistic understanding of complex

phenomena. Similarly, Shah (2019) found that students who engage in interdisciplinary

learning experiences develop more vital critical thinking skills, creativity, and problem-

solving abilities compared to those in traditional disciplinary-focused programs.

Given these points, the qualitative insights gathered from students provide
invaluable depth to comprehend the complex relationship between academic resilience,
Design-Based Biology Education (DBE), and cognitive outcomes. By merging
quantitative analyses with qualitative narratives, the researcher can better understand how
individual traits and educational interventions shape students’ cognitive growth and
academic journeys. These findings serve as a foundation for crafting tailored
interventions and instructional strategies to reinforce students’ resilience, adaptive
thinking abilities, and interdisciplinary proficiencies, ultimately equipping them to excel
in a dynamic educational arena. Through DBE, students acquire subject-specific
knowledge and cultivate the flexible thinking skills and resilience essential for navigating
contemporary challenges. By synthesizing the insights from this study with existing

research, a comprehensive picture emerges, affirming DBE’s potential to foster adaptive


thinking, resilience, and interdisciplinary competence among students, thus preparing

them for success in an ever-changing world.

Implications to Biology Education

The implications drawn from the effectiveness of the interaction between Design-
Based Biology Education (DBE) and academic resilience, as a moderator, on student
cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking have profound

consequences for biology education in theory and practice.

Firstly, the findings emphasize the importance of fostering resilience among
students, as it is a critical factor in enhancing cognitive flexibility. By equipping students
with the mindset to persevere through challenges and setbacks, educators can cultivate an
environment conducive to developing adaptable thinking skills essential for success in
biology and beyond. Incorporating resilience-building activities and strategies into the
curriculum can empower students to approach complex biological concepts confidently

and quickly.

Secondly, the observed interaction between DBE and academic resilience ona
growth mindset highlights the need for a balanced approach to teaching and learning.
While DBE emphasizes problem solving and critical thinking, academic resilience
moderates its impact on fostering a growth mindset. Educators must recognize the
delicate relationship between these factors and design interventions promoting resilience
and a growth-oriented mindset. Encouraging students to embrace challenges as

opportunities for growth, coupled with the inquiry-based nature of DBE, can instill a


sense of optimism and resilience, essential for navigating the complexities of biology

education.

Furthermore, the significant interaction between DBE and academic resilience in
transdisciplinary thinking highlights the interdisciplinary nature of modern biology
education. As biology continues to intersect with other disciplines, such as chemistry,
physics, and environmental science, students must develop the ability to integrate
knowledge across domains. DBE provides a fertile ground for fostering transdisciplinary
thinking by engaging students in authentic, real-world problem solving activities that
transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. By harnessing the synergistic effects of
DBE and academic resilience, educators can nurture students' capacity to approach
complex biological issues from multiple perspectives, preparing them for the

interdisciplinary challenges of the future.

In practice, these implications call for a paradigm shift in biology education
toward a more holistic and student-centered approach. Educators must move beyond rote
memorization and embrace pedagogical strategies that promote resilience, a growth
mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. Incorporating DBE principles into the curriculum
can provide students with hands-on experiences that stimulate inquiry, creativity, and
collaboration. Moreover, fostering a supportive learning environment that nurtures
students’ academic resilience can empower them to overcome obstacles and thrive in the

face of adversity.

Furthermore, the significant positive interaction between academic resilience and
DBE features the importance of considering individual differences in educational

interventions. Educators should recognize the synergistic effects of resilience-building


strategies and innovative teaching methodologies, tailoring interventions to meet the
diverse needs of students. Additionally, the findings suggest that the impact of DBE on
students’ cognitive skills may vary depending on their level of academic resilience. Thus,
educators should strive to create inclusive learning environments that support students
with varying levels of resilience, providing personalized support and scaffolding as

needed.

All things considered, the effectiveness of the interaction between DBE and
academic resilience in enhancing student cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and
transdisciplinary thinking accentuates the transformative potential of innovative
pedagogical approaches in biology education. By leveraging these insights, educators can
cultivate a new generation of biologists equipped with the skills, mindset, and

adaptability needed to address the complex challenges of the 21st century.

Transdisciplinary Thinking as a Predictor of Cognitive Flexibility and Growth
Mindset

In the previous section of this chapter, it was highlighted that Design-Based
Biology Education (DBE) facilitates the enhancement of skills such as cognitive
flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary thinking. As part of the investigation,
this research aims to examine whether transdisciplinary thinking positively predicts the
cognitive flexibility and growth mindset of students within the experimental DBE group.
To achieve this, simple linear regression analyses were undertaken on the mean posttest
ratings of the students in the DBE group from the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI),

Mindsets in Transition Scale (MTS), and Transdisciplinary Thinking Scale (TTS).


Before exploring the predictive capacity of transdisciplinary thinking on both
cognitive flexibility and growth mindset among biology students, a comprehensive
assessment of its foundational assumptions was conducted to ensure the robustness of
analysis and interpretation. Scatterplot examinations thoroughly examined the
relationship between each predictor and the dependent variables for linearity, revealing
no deviations from linear expectations. Similarly, the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for
the predictor, transdisciplinary thinking, was well below the threshold of 5, effectively
dismissing concerns regarding multicollinearity. Additionally, the Shapiro-Wilk test
confirmed the normality of the residuals (W = .976, p = .406), thereby satisfying the
normality criterion. Moreover, homoscedasticity, indicating uniform variance of residuals
across the range of predicted values, was affirmed through Scatterplot analysis (refer to
Appendix P). The depicted figure illustrates a random displacement of scores, forming a
rectangular shape devoid of systematic patterns or clustering, thus confirming the
fulfillment of the homoscedasticity assumption. Furthermore, these comprehensive
diagnostic tests collectively validate the fundamental assumptions underpinning the
multiple linear regression model, laying a solid groundwork for subsequent analyses

(Kim, 2019).

Table 56 presents the impact of transdisciplinary thinking on predicting cognitive
flexibility among students exposed to Design-Based Biology Education (DBE). The R”
value of .175 indicates that approximately 17.5% of the variability in cognitive flexibility
scores can be explained by transdisciplinary thinking, serving as the predictor variable.
Having F(1, 48) = 9.968 and p = .003, these results signify a statistically significant

relationship.


The findings demonstrate that transdisciplinary thinking positively predicts
cognitive flexibility (@ = .418, p = .003). This result implies a significant positive
association between transdisciplinary thinking and cognitive flexibility, suggesting that
students with higher levels of transdisciplinary thinking tend to exhibit greater cognitive
flexibility. Hence, the outcome highlights the importance of incorporating
interdisciplinary approaches in education, problem solving, and decision making to

cultivate cognitive flexibility and adaptability in addressing complex issues.

On a separate note, Table 57 illustrates the influence of transdisciplinary thinking
on predicting the growth mindset of students engaged in Design-Based Biology
Education (DBE). The R? value of .246 indicates that approximately 24.6% of the

variability in growth mindset ratings can be accounted for by transdisciplinary thinking as


the predictor variable. With an F(1, 48) value of 15.360 and p-value of .000, these

findings denote a statistically significant relationship.

The analysis reveals that transdisciplinary thinking positively predicts a growth
mindset (8 = .496, p = .000). This suggests a notable positive correlation between
transdisciplinary thinking and growth mindset, indicating that individuals with higher
levels of transdisciplinary thinking tend to demonstrate a stronger growth mindset. This
finding stresses the potential synergy between interdisciplinary approaches and the belief
in personal development and resilience. It suggests that cultivating transdisciplinary
thinking may enhance problem-solving skills and foster a more adaptive and resilient

mindset conducive to learning and personal growth.

To further discuss these results, this research investigated the impact of

transdisciplinary thinking on cognitive flexibility and growth mindset among students


engaged in Design-Based Biology Education (DBE). The research question was whether
transdisciplinary thinking positively predicts cognitive flexibility and a growth mindset in

this educational context.

Based on existing literature suggesting the potential benefits of interdisciplinary
approaches on cognitive flexibility and mindset development (Braem & Tobias, 2018;
Budwig & Alexander, 2020; Kapasi & Pei, 2022), the researcher hypothesized that higher
levels of transdisciplinary thinking would be associated with greater cognitive flexibility
and a stronger growth mindset among students exposed in an innovative pedagogical

approach.

Interpreting the results regarding cognitive flexibility, the significant positive
association between transdisciplinary thinking and cognitive flexibility corroborates with
previous research emphasizing the benefits of interdisciplinary learning environments
(Shah, 2019; Sucu & Bedel, 2021). This finding suggests that exposure to DBE, which
inherently promotes transdisciplinary thinking, may enhance students’ ability to adapt
their thinking and problem-solving strategies in response to diverse challenges.
Furthermore, it stresses the relevance of integrating multiple disciplines in education to
cultivate cognitive flexibility, a crucial skill in addressing complex issues in various

fields.

Similarly, the significant positive correlation between transdisciplinary thinking
and a growth mindset resonates with prior studies highlighting the role of mindset in
shaping learning behaviors and outcomes (Anderman & Gray, 2015; Jurgena et al.,
2018). This suggests that students who engage in DBE, which emphasizes

interdisciplinary thinking. are more likely to develop a growth mindset characterized by


resilience and a belief in the potential for personal development. Such findings emphasize
the importance of fostering a supportive educational environment that encourages

students to embrace challenges and view failures as opportunities for growth.

The significant positive associations between transdisciplinary thinking and
cognitive flexibility and growth mindset among students engaged in Design-Based
Biology Education (DBE) explain the potential impact of specific teaching interventions
on student outcomes. Several steps within the teaching intervention may have contributed

to these results.

Firstly, the DBE curriculum likely incorporated interdisciplinary approaches by
integrating concepts and methodologies from various scientific disciplines, such as
biology, chemistry, and engineering. This approach encouraged students to explore
complex problems from multiple perspectives, fostering their ability to think flexibly and
adaptively. By engaging with diverse disciplinary perspectives, students were likely
exposed to different ways of thinking and problem-solving strategies, thereby enhancing

their cognitive flexibility.

Secondly. the DBE teaching approach may have emphasized active learning and
hands-on experiences, providing students with opportunities to apply their knowledge
and skills in real-world contexts. Such experiential learning activities promote a more
profound understanding and retention of concepts and the development of growth
mindset beliefs (Jurgena et al., 2018). By engaging in authentic scientific inquiry and
design projects, students may have been more inclined to adopt a growth mindset,

viewing challenges as opportunities for learning and growth.


Additionally, the teaching intervention may have incorporated strategies to
promote metacognition and self-reflection among students. By encouraging students to
reflect on their learning process, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and set goals for
improvement, the intervention likely fostered a growth mindset orientation (Dweck,
2006). Moreover, promoting metacognitive awareness can enhance students’ ability to

monitor and regulate their thinking, thereby facilitating cognitive flexibility.

Furthermore, the DBE approach may have provided collaborative learning and
peer interaction opportunities, supporting cognitive flexibility and growth mindset
development. Collaborative learning environments promote the exchange of ideas, the
negotiation of meaning, and the consideration of diverse perspectives, all of which are
conducive to cognitive flexibility (Sucu & Bedel, 2021). Additionally, peer support and
encouragement can help cultivate a sense of belonging and competence, key components

of a growth mindset (Zhao et al., 2021).

Consequently, the teaching intervention likely facilitated the development of
cognitive flexibility and growth mindset among students through its interdisciplinary
approach, emphasis on active learning and hands-on experiences, promotion of
metacognition and self-reflection, and encouragement of collaborative learning. These
findings highlight the importance of thoughtful instructional design and pedagogical

practices in fostering positive student outcomes in educational settings.

Overall, the results of this study provide empirical support for the value of
transdisciplinary thinking in promoting cognitive flexibility and a growth mindset among
students engaged in DBE. These findings contribute to understanding the benefits of

interdisciplinary education and underline the importance of incorporating


transdisciplinary approaches in educational settings to prepare students for success in an

increasingly complex and interconnected world.

The findings are reinforced by recurring themes identified through the analysis of
student journal entries, a key aspect of this study. These themes underline
transdisciplinary thinking, cognitive flexibility, and growth mindset connections. Table
58 presents excerpts from students’ journals, illustrating their perspectives on how the

teaching intervention facilitated the integration of these variables.

Finally, framing the D.R.E.A.M. instructional innovation framework in biology

education provides actionable steps for educators to effectively integrate Design-Based


Biology Education (DBE) into their teaching practices. By incorporating essential
instructional practices such as design thinking, transdisciplinary projects, and growth
mindset teaching, educators are equipped with tangible tools to create engaging learning
environments that nurture curiosity, foster creativity, and develop critical thinking skills
among students. This approach emphasizes the importance of evidence-based
pedagogical strategies, offering educators practical methods grounded in research to
transform teaching and learning practices within biology education. Additionally,
implementing the D.R.E.A.M. framework necessitates ongoing teacher preparation and
continuous professional development efforts. Pre-service teacher training programs can
incorporate elements of the D.R.E.A.M. framework to ensure that future educators are
equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to implement DBE in their classrooms
effectively. Continuous professional development initiatives focused on the D.R.E.A.M.
framework provide practicing teachers with opportunities to refine their instructional
strategies, stay informed about current research and best practices, and adapt to the
evolving landscape of biology education. By prioritizing ongoing learning and
professional growth, educators can effectively leverage the D.R.E.A.M. framework to

Recommendations
Based on the study's findings, a set of practical recommendations emerges to not
only improve outcomes but also guide future research, effectively utilize conclusions, and

address areas requiring further attention:


Tailor Educator Training Programs. Develop specialized training programs for
educators to seamlessly integrate Design-Based Biology Education (DBE) principles into
their teaching methodologies. These programs should be carefully designed to equip
educators with the skills and knowledge required for successful DBE implementation.
For this reason, they can enhance student learning outcomes, promote innovative
teaching practices, prepare students for the future of work, address the needs of diverse

learners, and promote lifelong learning for educators.

Promote Collaborative Initiatives. Fostering collaboration among educators,
researchers, and policymakers is crucial as it allows for the development of evidence-
based strategies to enhance cognitive flexibility, growth mindset, and transdisciplinary
thinking in biology education, creating more robust instructional approaches through the
pooling of expertise and resources. As such, this collaboration is crucial for advancing
biology education. It ensures that instructional approaches are grounded in research,
responsive to the needs of students, and aligned with broader educational goals. Through
collaborative efforts, stakeholders can work toward creating learning environments that
foster critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability, ultimately preparing students for

success in a constantly changing world.

Embrace Continuous Improvement. Embracing a continuous improvement
approach in evaluating and refining DBE implementation strategies is essential because it
allows educators to adapt to evolving educational landscapes and effectively address
students’ changing needs. By regularly soliciting feedback from both students and
educators, educational practices can be refined to better align with students’ learning

styles, interests, and needs. This iterative process ensures that DBE remains relevant,


responsive, and impactful, ultimately improving student learning outcomes and overall

educational effectiveness.
For future research endeavors:

Examine Long-Term Impact. Investigating the long-term impact of DBE on
dimensions beyond the study's scope, such as academic achievement, career readiness,
and lifelong learning skills, is crucial as it provides insights into the holistic benefits of
DBE and informs the refinement of educational practices. Understanding how DBE
influences various aspects of students' lives over time allows for developing more
comprehensive and effective educational approaches tailored to meet long-term learning

outcomes and prepare students for future success in diverse contexts.

Analyze Contextual Factors. Analyzing how contextual factors such as school
culture, socioeconomic status, and teacher characteristics influence the effectiveness of
DBE implementation is crucial because it enables the customization of DBE approaches
to specific educational contexts, ultimately enhancing their effectiveness and inclusivity.
Understanding how these factors interact with DBE implementation can inform the
development of tailored strategies that address diverse student populations’ unique needs
and challenges, ensuring equitable access to high-quality biology education for all

learners.

Conduct Comparative Studies. Conducting comparative studies across diverse
educational settings and student populations is crucial as it allows for a comprehensive
assessment of DBE's effectiveness. By examining DBE's impact in various cultural

contexts and among students with diverse learning needs, researchers can gain a more


nuanced understanding of its effectiveness. This comparative analysis enables the
identification of best practices and challenges associated with DBE implementation
across different contexts, informing the development of tailored strategies to optimize its

effectiveness and ensure equitable outcomes for all students.
To utilize conclusions effectively:

Facilitate Professional Development. Developing targeted professional
development workshops and resources for educators to integrate DBE principles into
their curriculum effectively is essential because it provides educators with the support
and training needed for successful DBE implementation. By equipping educators with the
necessary knowledge, skills, and resources, they can confidently incorporate DBE
principles into their teaching practices, leading to enhanced student engagement, learning

outcomes, and overall educational effectiveness.

Promote Collaborative Dissemination Efforts. Collaborating with educational
institutions and organizations to disseminate research findings and advocate for adopting
evidence-based instructional approaches in biology education is vital because collective
efforts can accelerate the adoption of DBE practices on a broader scale. By sharing
research findings and promoting evidence-based instructional strategies, stakeholders can
collectively advocate for implementing DBE principles, leading to widespread adoption

and ultimately improving student learning outcomes in biology education.
To address potential study limitations:

Conduct Longitudinal Studies. Conducting large-scale longitudinal studies with

diverse participant groups is crucial to comprehensively evaluating DBE effectiveness.


By considering factors such as sample size, research design, and generalizability of
findings, these studies ensure robust results that accurately assess the long-term impact of
DBE on student learning outcomes, allowing educators and policymakers to make
informed decisions about the integration and refinement of DBE practices in biology

education.

Explore Mediating Variables. Investigating potential mediating and moderating
variables that may influence the relationship between DBE, academic resilience, and
student outcomes is essential as it provides insights into optimizing DBE interventions.
By understanding these factors, educators and researchers can identify how DBE impacts
student outcomes and adapt interventions to maximize effectiveness. This deeper
understanding enables the development of targeted strategies to support students’
academic resilience and enhance their overall learning experiences within a DBE

framework, ultimately leading to improved educational outcomes.

Consider Alternative Methodologies. Exploring alternative research
methodologies, such as mixed-methods approaches or experimental designs, is essential
as it allows for gaining deeper insights into the complex interactions between
instructional interventions and student outcomes in biology education. By employing
diverse research methodologies, researchers can triangulate findings, validate results, and
uncover subtle relationships that may not be apparent through traditional methods alone.
This comprehensive approach enhances the validity and reliability of research findings,
leading to a more thorough understanding of the effectiveness of instructional
