ABSTRACT

ALYSSA MAY G. CRESINO. University of the Philippines Los Bafios, May 2023.
Physiological Responses of Goats Fed Fermented “Kulapu” (Sargassum spp.) With
Probiotic and Yeast as Inoculant

Major Professor: Dr. RENATO SA. VEGA

Seaweed particularly Sargassum spp. is known to be abundant in the coastal area
of Batangas. Research regarding the use of this seaweed has been studied in different
livestock although studies regarding the effect of dietary supplementation of fermented
seaweed in small ruminants have not yet been established. Therefore, this study aimed to
determine the effect of the inclusion of different inoculants in the nutritional value of
seaweed, as well as the effect of using fermented seaweed as a substitute for legumes and
the duration of feeding in terms of hematologic parameters, palatability, and behavior of
the animal.

Low level of heavy metals was observed in the fresh seaweed sample (Cd: 0.209
ug/g, Pb: 1.40 g/g) in relation to the standard limit of WHO, USNRC and EU. Although
a slight increase in arsenic was observed (3.75 jig/g) in seaweeds where 3 mg/kg and 2
mg/kg were the standard limit according to WHO and EU regulations, respectively.
Proximate analysis of fresh seaweed showed nutrient content of 34.59% ash, 8.02% crude
protein, 10.56% crude fiber, 0.63% crude fat and 46.20% NFE. After the seaweed was
subjected to fermentation using molasses and different inoculants, its nutritional content
declined except for the NFE which showed increased value. The treatments that were used
in the study were as follows: Treatment 1: seaweed and molasses (no inoculant), Treatment
2: Lactobacillus plantarum S20 at Iml/L with 1x10° cfu (Campbell, et. al., 2020),
Treatment 3: with yeast at 30g/L at 1.2 x 10® cfu and Treatment 4: 50% Lactobacillus
plantarum $20:50% yeast. A significant difference was observed in the fermented seaweed
in terms of crude protein and crude fiber. The highest value for fermented seaweeds in
terms of CP and CF appeared to be treatment 3 showing contents of 13.68% ash, 7.38%
Cp, 4.86% CF, 0.06% CFat and 74.01% NFE.

During the feeding trial, a significant decline (p-value = 0.028) in the bodyweight
(10.008 kg) was observed in the first week of inclusion of the treatment, although the
following week showed that the animal started to gain weight after 2 weeks of continued
supplementation with the treatment.

Blood analysis showed significant differences in terms of duration of feeding for
RBC, tWBC and PCV. Total RBC and PCV counts showed decreasing trend while
remaining in the normal range. The tWBC count of the animal that appeared to be in the

xviii

maximum normal range greatly increased after the first week of supplementation and
showed a slow decline after week 2. Treatment 2 showed elevated levels of neutrophil and
dropped to below minimum in terms of lymphocytes. Treatment 3, although falling outside
the normal range appeared to be near normal compared to the level shown by Treatment 2.
However, these changes may not be solely attributed to the treatments since the animals
also exhibited respiratory symptoms during supplementation.

Further studies regarding the effect of supplementation in terms of the growth of
the animal is proposed in order to determine the potential of the supplementation. A longer
feeding trial is also recommended to be able to determine the effect on the body weight of
the animal as well as the long-term effect of the feed containing low-level heavy metal
supplement.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION

Seaweed is an important component of the marine ecosystem and can be viewed in
its ecological and economic value. It is considered as well as a source of protein in terms
of human and animal nutrition and can vary in protein content depending on the species
and environmental conditions (BFAR, 2010). Because of this, seaweeds might also be a

potential source of protein in the animal production.

Seaweed plays an important role in the ecosystem. It is the primary producer in the
reef ecosystem and provides nursery for marine organism and maintains biodiversity. It
also acts as a bioindicator to determine pollutants in the water (Satheesh et al., 2017).
Overexploitation of wild seaweeds may affect higher trophic level and fish stock due to

reduced shelter, food (direct and indirect) and nursery grounds (www.gov.scot)

Seaweeds in the Philippines are highly diversified among the flora of Asia-Pacific
regions with more than 800 species recorded up to date. Eucheuma, Kappaphycus,
Gracilaria spp. and Caulerpa lentillifera are the major commercial seaweeds in the
Philippines, while Codium, Gelidiela acerosa, Halymenia, Porphyra and Sargassum spp

appear to have economic importance as well.

Seaweed is known to have positive effects as a supplement for livestock. Some of
these studies showed improved overall health, immune function and somehow protect the

animals from heat stress and transport-induced oxidative stress (Kannan et al., 2017).

Heavy metals are naturally found in the environment. It is transported into the
environment in a small amount through natural erosion, wind, and water. The major cause
of the high amount of heavy metal in the environment is human activities. The most
common heavy metals that have detrimental effects on organisms are cadmium, lead,

mercury, chromium and arsenic.

Cadmium is one of the heavy metals to look at. It also appeared to be in much
greater quantity in commercial feed than those other possible feed ingredients. A study of
Vega et al., (2018), showed that pre-starter ration has 1.33 + 0.27 ppm of Cd, starter of
1.12 + 0.03 ppm, grower ration of 1.18 + 0.06 ppm and breeder ration of 1.35 + 0.12 ppm.
The level of cadmium detected with the commercial feed showed to be greater compared
to that of the alternative feed resource. Cadmium analysis of each ingredient used to make
commercial feed was also analyzed. The major ingredients such as rice bran, US soya,
ground corn and cassava meal showed 0.635 + 0.13 ppm, 0.68 + 0.0 ppm, 0.19 + 0.21 ppm
and 0.39 + 0.0 ppm, respectively. The highest cadmium concentration was detected in
monocalcium phosphate, limestone and salt which is 12.03 + 0,0 ppm, 8.22 + 0.07 ppm

and 7.1 + 0.07 ppm, respectively.

The use of alternative resources for feeding livestock is highly needed, to be able
to attain healthy food. The use of seaweed can be done as it is known to be a potential
source of protein for the animal. Fermentation using molasses which is ideal in producing
monosodium glutamate and lysine amino acids and known to make the feed ingredient

palatable to the animal is suggested (O'Hara and Mundree, 2016). Studies regarding the

effect of dietary supplementation of fermented seaweed in small ruminants have not yet
been established. Therefore, this study was conducted to be able to understand the potential

of seaweed as a supplement for small ruminants.

Objectives of the Study

This study aimed to determine the effects of supplementing fermented seaweeds in
some hematologic parameters, behavior and growth performance of goats. Specifically, it

aimed to;

. compare and analyze the effect of fermentation using plain molasses, Lactobacillus
plantarum S20 and yeast in the nutrient composition of seaweeds using proximate analysis;
. determine the effect of varying level of Sargassum spp. in the growth performance of
growing goats;

. analyze the effect of fermented Sargassum spp. supplementation in the animal using
complete blood count and liver function test particularly alanine transaminase (ALT);

. determine effect of feeding duration and the interaction between the treatment and the
duration of supplementation;

. determine the palatability and behavioral responses of goats with the supplement.

Time and Place of the Study

The first part of the study was conducted at Brgy. Limbon, Indang, Cavite while
the second part of the study was conducted at quarantine house of the Institute of Animals
Science- University of the Philippines Los Banos. Seaweed was harvested from Brgy.
Lumaniag, Lian, Batangas, Philippines. Proximate analysis of the fermented seaweed was
conducted at the Lipa Quality Control Center Inc. - Lipa, Batangas. Heavy metal analysis
was done at F.A.S.T Laboratories-Brgy. Makiling, Calamba City, Laguna. Complete blood
count analysis was analyzed at Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL) - Maahas
station at CVM Complex-University of the Philippines Los Banos. The Alanine
Transaminase analysis (GPT) was conducted at Vetsquare Veterinary Clinic- Kalaw

Compound, Batong Malake, Los Banos, Laguna.

CHAPTER 1
REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

Seaweed

Importance of Seaweed

Seaweed plays an important role in the environment and ecology. Seaweed serves
as food and habitat for several species of fish and invertebrates as well as safe havens from
predators (Rivera, et al. 2006). Macroalgal, unlike plants, absorbs nutrients and water
through their tissue, although they produce energy the same way. Because of the absence
of the root system, seaweed only grows in shallow water where light penetrates
(http://nature.ca/explore/dief/isap_e.cfm). Seaweed needs to be attached to something to
be able to survive although there are few that can survive while drifting loose in water

(www. botany.uwc.ac.za/envfacts/seaweeds/index.htm).

It is known that Sargassum cristaefolium accounted for 97.96% of the total
population of this species in Matabungkay, Batangas where it occurs in the
most quadrats in four occurrences while Hormophysa triquetra was found to be the least
species of seaweed with the abundance of 0.71%. Also, Sargassum cristaefolium had the
highest domain rank among the other seaweed observed because it has the highest
importance in terms of relative density, relative cover and relative frequency (Cabrera et
al., 2015). Sargassaceae was found to be the most abundant species in the area supporting
the study of Saquido et al., (1999) where the researchers found that Sargassaceae was the

most common species in Nasugbu, Batangas as well as the study of Ramas (2011)

conducted in Calatagan, Batangas where same specie was observed. According to Rivera
et al., (2006), Sargassaceae can grow from a few to several meters high above the substrate
and is abundant in tropical and subtropical waters. It is commonly found in Philippines
waters and produces extensive beds found in the rocky intertidal and shallow sub-tidal
shores (Ang, 1986). There are species of this family that are abundant because it can
reproduce in the first year of its life has as observable fast growth (Kraan, 2007). In a study
conducted by Kraan (2007), the researcher found out that Sargassum sp. can invade
and out compete local species of seaweeds in Ireland which proves that this family of
seaweeds is very competitive and can survive and adapt in the environment faster than
those of the other families and can thrive in deeper water. Depending on the depth of water
it lives in, Sargassum sp. can grow up to 45 cm tall (Carpenter, 1998) and therefore, the
ability of this species to adapt to different depths makes it the most abundant species.
According to Carbrera et al., (2017), there is a significant change in the cover of seaweeds
by the month of October to December. The gradual decline in the number of seaweeds as
the year ends might be a result of seasonal change, when the months becomes colder and
weather disturbance approaches. This finding contradicts the study of Carpenter et al.,
(1998), where S. cristaefolium is least abundant by the month of February to May and most
abundant from November to January. However, the decrease is due to strong currents and

‘waves.

Fermented Sargassum spp.

Fermentation is a process that converts complex substances such as carbohydrates,
lipids, and proteins into simpler compounds, improving nutritional content and making the
product more digestible and appealing (Wu et al., 2016). Ardiansyah et al., (2018)
discovered an increase in the nutritive value of Sargassum powder fermented with
Aspergillus niger, Lactobacillus spp., and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, implying that
microbial fermentation may increase nutritional value by increasing protein and mineral
content.

Lactic acid bacteria are recognized to create lactic acid, a key by-product of
carbohydrate fermentation. It is frequently utilized for fermentative preservation of a
variety of items. In a study conducted by Shobharani et al., (2013), in which lactic acid
bacteria were included in Sargassum spp. fermentation increased lactic acid content and
decreased pH, as well as an increase in total and reducing sugars was also observed along
with cell wall viability up to 12 days of incubation, with no additional reduction in sugar
during prolonged incubation. As a result, it was determined that a 12-day fermentation
period was recommended for Sargassum.

The antioxidant activity of seaweed was also investigated. By scavenging free
radicals, antioxidants aid the body's battle against degenerative diseases. Sargassum has
been extensively researched for its antioxidant capabilities. The research of Shobharani et
al., (2013) demonstrated that fermentation using lactic acid bacteria improved its

antioxidant properties. The rise in antioxidants was caused by the rupture of the seaweed

cell wall, which resulted in an increase in polyphenol content, which is a known antioxidant
molecule.

Nutrient Composition of Seaweeds

Seaweed composition varies depending on the type of species, season, and
sampling techniques. According to Burtin (2003), seaweed contains a high concentration
of vitamins, minerals, polysaccharides, pigments, polyphenols, fibers, lipids and protein. It
also has more than 54 trace elements in quantities greater than land plants that are required
for physiological functions (Chapman and Chapman, 1980). Seaweed’s protein content is
comparable with that of high protein crops used in animal feeds such as soybean which has
35% protein in dry mass while the protein observed in seaweeds varies from 5-35%. The
protein content of seaweed varies depending on species. In the case of brown seaweeds,
the protein content observed was 3+15% in dry weight basis while the red and green
seaweeds has 10£47% [CEVA, Arakasi et al., 2018]. The species of seaweed that are
widely used such as Laminaria digitata, Ascophyllum nodosum, Himanthalia elongate and
Fucus vesiculosus have a protein content ranging from 11 and 24% on a dry weight basis.
Seaweeds belonging to genus Ulva has a protein content of 10 and 26%, like that of the
seaweeds widely consumed by Japanese people named ‘‘ao-nori" which has a protein
content of 20 and 26% (Fujiwara-Arasaki, 1984). A higher protein content was observed
in species of seaweed with red color such as Porphyra tenera which has 47% of dry mass
and 35% in Palmaria. The seasonal period also affects the protein content of seaweed. In
a study conducted in French Atlantic coast where the protein content of Palmira palmate

varies depending on season. Higher protein content up to 25% was observed during the end

of spring and winter while lower content (9%) was shown during summer months (Galland-
Irmouli, N/A). The lipid content of seaweed is about 1-5% of algal DM and observed to
have polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in omega 3 and omega 6 form, which plays an

essential role in health (Burtin, 2003; MacArtain et al., 2007).

Effect of Seaweed Supplementation in Ruminant

As stated by Fleurence, (1999), there are a lot of studies which prove the benefits
of supplementing seaweed in cattle. Feeding seaweed to animals can improve the overall
health, immune function and somehow protect the livestock from heat stress and transport
stress which induced oxidative stress (Kannan et al., 2017). It is believed that heat stress
can significantly affect the performance of cattle in terms of reproductive performance,
milk production and overall health of the animal. Spiers et al., (2004) observed that feeding
kelp meal reduces the core temperature of the animal when suffering from fescue toxicosis,

although the effect of supplementation did not last for more than 3-4 days.

Usually, studies regarding the use of seaweeds suggest that using a lower
concentration of A. nodosum could improve the milk constituent, milk yield and
performance of the cattle, but giving a higher concentration may reduce the feed intake,
suggesting unpalatability (Erickson et al., 2012). Cvetkovic et al., (2004), suggest that
feeding 56.7 g of seaweed/head/day can increase the lactation efficiency and increase
protein content of milk without any effect on the feed intake. Also, feeding of commercial
seaweed with concentrate at 50g/head/day in dairy cattle, improves the milk composition
and yield, nutrient digestibility, feed conversion, blood serum protein and rumen

fermentation activity of lactating Friesian cows as compared to control group. Another

10

study supported that finding of Cvetkovic et al., (2004), where seaweed enhanced the milk
yield of the animal as well as the percentage of lactose, fat, total solids, ash content and

solid non-fat (Bendary et al., 2013).

Supplementation of seaweed also enhances the fatty acid profile, cholesterol level,
and nutritional quality of the meat. According to Hwang et al., (2014), supplementing 2%
Undaria pinnatifida increased serum IgG concentration, gain to feed ration and average
daily gain (ADG) of Hanwoo steers. It also increased the concentration of linoleic acid and
stearic acid while reduced concentration of palmitoleic acid and myristic acid was observed
in the muscle. No effect was found in the unsaturated, saturated, monounsaturated, and
polyunsaturated fatty acid and quality grade of the meat. Braden et al., (2004), stated that
the antimicrobial property of seaweeds influences the gut microbiota, which then improves
the beneficial organism. Giving 2% A. nodosum in crossbreed steers and heifers reduced
enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) 0157 (33%) and 0157:H7 (37%) in hide

swabs and 9% and 11% in fecal sample.

Greenhouse gases such as ammonia and methane are a major problem faced by the
cattle industry (Abberton et al., 2008). Some researchers suggest that giving cattle seaweed
may reduce the production of greenhouse gases, although the decrease may vary according
to the seaweed species. Study of Dubois et al., (2013), suggested that some seaweeds
decrease the total gas production and methane while other seaweeds showed increase in
the fermentation and gas production in an in vitro gas production procedure. Another study

where phlorotannins from A. nodosum was added in mixed forage or barley grain resulted

11

in decrease in methane, total gas production and ammonia after 24 hours of incubation in
vitro. This suggests that supplementation of seaweed in cattle helps reduce the greenhouse

gas production in ruminants.

Effect of Seaweeds in other Species

In a study conducted by Kulshreshtha et al., (2014), the effect of red seaweed,
particularly Sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii and Chondrus crispus in the growth
performance, egg quality and gut microbiota of laying hens was observed. The result
showed that groups given red seaweeds have a more efficient feed conversion ratio per
gram of egg. Also, the group with 1% Sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii had an increased egg
yolk weight. Furthermore, groups supplemented with red seaweeds had an increased villus
height, villus surface as well as higher concentration of short chain fatty acids compared to
the control group. Additionally, supplementation of seaweed also increased the prevalence
of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium longum and Streotococcus salivarius in the
gut of the chicken while reducing the abundance of Clostridium perfringens.

Another study where seaweed was given to broiler chicken to determine the effect
on the growth and blood profile resulted in an increase in body weight gain and gain:feed
ratio. The mortality was observed to be lower in the groups given seaweed and seaweed
by-products. Supplementation of seaweeds and seaweed by-products does not have an
effect on the feed intake, compared to the control group, where no supplementation was
given, as well as the total organ weight, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and lipids. A
significant difference in the feed intake was observed in groups supplemented with

fermented by-products of seaweeds (lower) compared to that of the fermented. Glutamic

12

pyruvate transaminase (GPT) was observed to be higher in the group supplemented with
seaweeds at day 17. The IgA antibody concentration in treatments supplemented with
seaweed by-products particularly the treatments with 0.5% brown seaweed (BS), 0.5%
seaweed fusiforme (SF) and 0.5% fermented seaweed fusiforme (FSF) groups was higher
(p <0.01%) while lower IgA concentration was seen in 0.5% fermented brown seaweed
(FBS) compared to control group at day 35. The IgM concentration of groups
supplemented with seaweed was significantly higher, where groups with fermented
seaweed by-products possessing the highest level compared to all other treatments. But a
lower IgG concentration was observed in the treatment groups compared to the control

group (Choi et al., 2014).

Seaweeds in Hematologic Parameter

Ina study on the influence of supplementing Ascophyllum nodosum in hematologic
parameters in cows, it was observed that there is no significant difference between the
control group and the cows given 80 grams seaweed/cow/day in terms of milk production
or milk protein and fat. According to Beitz and Nafikov, (2007), Reynolds, (2005),
Schultz, (1968), glucose is an indicator of energy status and a precursor for lactose
synthesis in the mammary gland. Glucose was observed to be higher (p <0.01%) in the
group given Ascophyllum nodosum although the values recorded are still in the normal
range (Braun et al., 2007). In a similar study where glucose was observed in goats (Kannan
et al., 2007) and lambs (Archer at al., 2007), a higher glucose level was reported.
Researchers hypothesize that the increase in the blood glucose when seaweed is

supplemented is probably that seaweed increases the propionate production in the animal’s

13

rumen which then leads to the production of glucose (Bergman et al., 1974). Another
mechanism that researchers are looking is the stimulation in the development of intestinal
microflora in rumen which resulted in an improved digestion and better utilization of feed
nutrients (Hnisova et al., 2011). Also, Wang et al., (2009) (in vitro) and Braden et al.,
(2004) (in vivo) stated that Ascophyllum nodosum can restrict the growth of pathogens such
as E. coli. As cited by Karatzia et al., (2012) sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) is a liver-
specific enzyme that is involved in carbohydrate metabolism (Soveri et al., 1992; Grucka-
Mamcezar et al., 2007). The normal activity of SDH is low in a healthy animal, and an
increase above normal range indicates hepatocellular injury. In the study conducted by
Karatzia et al., (2012), Ascophyllum nodosum appeared to decrease the SDH in cows during
the period of lactation and it is possible that Ascophyllum nodosum exerts a
hepatoprotective effect on the cows as observed in this study. Blood hemoglobin, packed
cell volume (PCV), erythrocyte count and total leukocyte count were also measured to see
the effect on the overall health status of the dairy cows. It was observed that seaweed
supplementation particularly Ascophyllum nodosum increased blood glucose, decreases
blood sorbitol dehydrogenase and no adverse effect in the blood hemoglobin, packed cell
volume, erythrocyte count and total leukocyte count. Therefore, it is concluded that
supplementation of Ascophyllum nodosum improves energy utilization and is observed to
express hepatoprotective effect.

Another study where the effect of supplementing fermented, and non-fermented
brown seaweed was observed in layers it was observed that supplementing 0.5% seaweeds

helps improve egg production. The group given with 0.5% brown seaweed (BS), appeared

14

to have the highest blood albumins compared to basal control diet (CON), 0.5% seaweed
fusiforme (SF), 0.5% fermented brown seaweed (FBS) and 0.5% fermented seaweed
fusiforme (FSF). The group with FBS, had the highest triglycerides and total cholesterol.
Additionally, the FBS and BS groups showed higher level of aminotransferase (ALT/GPT)
and blood alanine compared to all other treatments. In terms of globulin, aspartate
aminotransferase (AST/GOT), and blood urea nitrogen levels, there were no significant

differences observed (Choi et al., 2017)
Heavy Metal
Heavy Metals in the Environment

Heavy metals are naturally present in the environment. They have a high atomic
weight and a density of five times that of water. They are widely employed in various
industrial, agricultural, and medical applications, causing them to be widely-spread
throughout the environment. The toxicity of certain heavy metals varies according to dose,
method of exposure, and chemical species, as well as the exposed organism's age, gender,
genetic factor, and nutritional state. Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and lead are known to
cause multiple organ damage even at low levels of exposure, that is why public health is
becoming increasingly concerned (Tchounwou et al., 2012). Heavy metal contamination
can also occur by metal corrosion, air deposition, soil erosion, leaching, sediment
resuspension, and metal evaporation from water resources to soil and ground water,

according to Tchounwov et al., (2012) in a study conducted by Nriagu, (1989).

15

According to Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry-ATSDR, (2000),
arsenic which consist of trivalent arsenite and pentavalent arsenate (major inorganic
compounds) as well as monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsonic acid (DMA) and
trimethylarsine oxide (organic compounds) are detected in almost all environmental
matrices at low concentration. As concentrations in the environment are caused by natural
occurrences such as soil erosion and volcanic eruptions, as well as man-made actions such
as the application of herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, and so on. Arsenic can also be
included in medications used to treat tapeworm infestation in sheep and cattle. Arsenic
exposure occurs in some cases through eating, inhalation, skin contact, and parenteral
administration. According to Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry-ATSDR,
(2000), arsenic concentrations in air range from 1 to 3ng/m3 at locations remote from
human release, while it is reported to reach 20 to 100 ng/m3 in cities. Arsenic is also found
to be concentrated in water at less than 10 ug/L. A range of 1 to 40 ng/kg is naturally found
in the soil, but when the ground is exposed to pesticide application or waste disposal, higher

concentration can be observed.

Cadmium is widely distributed in the ground at an average concentration of about
0.1mg/kg, and about 15mg/kg in sedimentary rocks and marine phosphate (Soignet et al.,
2001). Cadmium is generally used in industrial activities such as production of alloys,
pigment, and batteries (Wilson, 1988). The main routes of exposure to these heavy metals
is by ingestion of food and inhalation, although skin absorption can also occur rarely

(Patlolla et al., 2000). According to Satarug et al., (2003), trace amount of these can be

16

seen in food such as potatoes, leafy vegetable, grains and seeds. liver, kidney, crustaceans,

and mollusk.

Based on a study by Gabby, conducted in 2003 and 2006, lead also occurs in the
earth’s crust naturally in small amount, although anthropogenic activities increase
concentration of this element in the environment. Lead is widely used in the production of
lead acid batteries, ammunition, etc. It is also seen in various products such as paint, glass
pigment and sheet lead. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry (ATSDR), lead exposure occurs through the inhalation of contaminated dust
particles or aerosols, as well as the consumption of food, water, and paints. Human data
backup animal findings that prenatal lead exposure reduces birth weight and causes preterm

delivery, as well as offspring with neurological impairments.
Heavy Metal and its Effect

Metals are naturally found in the earth’s crust and are transported into bodies of
water in powdered form through natural erosion with water and wind. This process emits
only a small amount of metals into the environment. The real cause of spread of these
metals in the environment is through human activities such as mining, release of industrial
waste, smelting and incineration of fossil fuel. (Bhargava et al., 2012). Metals, specifically
arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) are considered as
hazards to public health because of their high toxicity that can cause organ damage even at
lower levels of exposure (Directive 2002/32/EC). These metals are also found in complete

feeds according to NRC for pigs (2012) and cattle (2000) with a maximum level mg/kg dry

17

matter for As 2 mg/kg for Cd in terms of cattle, goat and sheep is 1 mg/kg while in other
animal feed is 0.5 mg/kg, for Pb it is 5 mg/kg for all species and 0.1 mg/kg in Hg. These
metals affect body tissue and organs when they bioaccumulate, specifically if they disrupt
cellular events including proliferation, growth, differentiation, apoptosis and damage-

repairing processes.

Lead is a well-known toxic metal ion that has gained attention due to its wide range
of negative biological effects and high adhesion, particularly in oil, sediment, and sewage
sludge (Shaheen, et al. 2017). Pb can enter the body through the skin, however it is usually
absorbed through the digestive and respiratory systems (Kianoush et al., 2015). According
to Wuana and Okieimen, (2011); EFSA (2010), as stated by Hejna et al., (2018), this metal
is associated with human health because it can cause impaired development, lower IQ,
shortened attention span, hyperactivity, and mental deterioration in children. Adults have
memory loss, nausea, sleeplessness, anorexia, joint weakness, and harm to the brain,
neurological system, red blood cells, and kidneys. Animal studies showed that lead
exposure can cause inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) in immature brain
of rat (Struzynska et al., 2007). Exposure in the range of 0.1-0.4 MPb increased serum
endothelin-1 (ET-1), serum nitric oxide (NO), and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) appeared
with lung pathological changes in ovalbumin (OA)sensitized and nonsensitized guinea pigs
as well as increased serum total protein, histamine, and total and differential white blood
cells (WBC) counts of guinea pigs (Boskabady et al., 2016; Farkhondeh et al., 2014).
Administration at 10 mg/kg,bw elevated acid phosphatases and decreased antioxidant

parameters while increasing oxidative parameters in rats (Abirami et al., 2007, Omobowale

18

et al., 2014). PbA exposure at 500 mg/L resulted in a significant increase in serum ALT,
AST, urea, uric acid, and creatinine levels, as well as elevated lipid peroxidase and
decreased GSH, SOD, CAT, and GPx levels in liver and kidney tissues (Wang et al., 2013).
Exposure to this level also enhanced apoptosis and caspase-3 activation in rat kidneys (Liu
et al., 2012). In rats, administration of PB at a dose of | mg/kg,bw.ip for four weeks resulted
in an increase in lipid peroxidation (Patra et al., 2001). PbA exposure at 100 mg/kg/bw
enhanced lipid peroxidation and lowered SOD and total GSH in rats' liver and kidney (El-
Sokkary et al., 2005). PbA administration at 25 mg. kg,bw, ip for 5 days in rats resulted in
increased urea and creatinine levels, decreased total protein and albumin in serum, and
lowered antioxidant indices. This level also caused bleeding in the renal tubules, epithelial
cell degeneration, Bowman's capsule disintegration, and necrosis in kidney tissue (Abdou
and Hassan, 2014). PbA at 30 and 60 mg/kg bw orally administered three times a week for
three months reduced testicular weight, sperm count, and testicular ALP activity. This
amount also led to dose-dependent aberrant sperm count, seminiferous tubule necrosis, and
loss of seminiferous tubular epithelium (Sujatha et al., 2011). According to USNRC the
maximum tolerable level of lead in an animal feed is 100 mg/kg for cattle and sheep while
10 mg/kg for swine, poultry, fish and horses. The EU regulation stated that an amount of

10 ppm in feed material was accepted as maximum level.

Cadmium (Cd) is a metal ion known to be a very serious pollutant because it’s very
mobile in soil and has tendency to bioaccumulate due to high solubility in water (Qi et al.,
2018). Ingestion of contaminated food with Cd can cause major exposure as well as in

contaminated water which could result in short- and long-term disorder (Cao et al., 2018;

19

Jiang et al., 2015; Richter et al., 2017). According to Liu et al. (2017) prolonged exposure
to cadmium can lead to lung cancer as well as bone and kidney damage. Animal studies
related to exposure on Cd have been studied. According to Borowska et al., (2017),
exposure at a level of 5 mg/kg in rats showed disorder in metabolism of Zn and Cu. It was
also found that increased level of Cd decreases the intestinal concentration of Cu and Fe.
Cd binds with metallothionein (MT) and other metal transporter in the small intestine and
accumulates in tissue which results in decreased concentration on Cu and Fe in the
gastrointestinal tract with decline in the absorption in the bloodstream (Ohta and Ohba,
2020). It is also suggested that Cd decreases the absorption of essential elements such as
Zn, Ca and Cu resulting in low dietary intake. The USNRC states that 10 ppm in the

maximum level of exposure in all species.

Arsenic is notably known as the king of poisons and poison of kings (Gupta et al.,
2017) is present as contaminant in food, water and environment. It is known to cause skin
damages, problems with circulatory system and increased risk of cancer in human (Food
Safety Authority of Ireland, 2009). Arsenic is primarily absorbed in the small intestine but
one can also be exposed through skin contact and inhalation (Ratnaike, 2003). The USNRC
stated an amount of 30 ppm for cattle and 5 ppm for fish as maximum tolerable level while
EU stated an amount of 2mg/kg in general feed material. In animal studies, according to
Namgung and Xia, (2001) there are two arsenic species that can induce apoptosis in rat
brain which are sodium arsenite and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). A study in male Wistar
rats revealed oxidative stress and activation of caspase-9, an apoptosis signaling initiator.

Furthermore, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the cause of lipid

20

bilayer degradation, which results in mitochondrial swelling (Bodaghi-Namileh et al.,
2018). Biochemical examination of Sprague-Dawley rat serum revealed that As3+
dramatically reduced serum cholinesterase (ChE) activity, which is associated with

peripheral and CNS damage (Patlolla and Tchounwou, 2005).

Removal efficiency and its economic advantages were also highlighted that the
processess are low cost, with high adsorption efficiency, regeneration efficiency, etc. Lead
was removed using several agricultural by-products such as orange peel, stalk waste,
coconut coir pith, etc. Studies related to coconut coir pith capacity on adsorption of Pb
showed a 263.0 mg/g adsorption capacity (Babarinde & Onyiaocha, 2016; Hassan, 2016;
Nadeem et al., 2016). Cadmium, which is known to be a serious pollutant can be removed
using rice and wheat bran as well as rice and black gram husk. Removal of cadmium using
charcoal showed a promising result of 50 to 98% removal (Sud et al, 2008) and highest
adsorption capacity was observed in coconut waste with 285.70 mg/g (Ogundipe &
Babarinde, 2017). Arsenic removal was done using the following agricultural by-products
such as water chestnut, coconut shells, rice husk etc. with efficiency ranging from 71 to

96% removal (Shakoor et al. 2016).

A study conducted by Ozbas et. al., (2014), on heavy metals particularly Cu, Ni,
Zn, Pb and Cd were removed using molasses hydrolysate by continuous method. The
researchers used molasses natural chelating agent. Molasses when oxidized under acidic

condition produces hydrolysate which includes natural chelating agent. The study showed

21

a removal efficiency of 91% for Cu, 86% for Ni, 99% for Zn, 61% for Pb, and 99% for Cd

at 0.55 mL/minute flow rate and a solid liquid ratio of 1:12.5 g/mL

Behavior of Goats

Goats belong to the Bovidae family, which means they have a compartmentalized
stomach and can digest fibrous plants and convert them into energy. The primary and
cheapest source of this energy for ruminant animals is high quality forage. Goats in
particular, eat leafy plants that are above or at the height of their head. Goats grasp food
with the use of their lip and usually in a top-down manner.

Unlike sheep, goat needs more energy (25%) for maintenance per pound of flesh.
In a dry matter intake (DMI) manner, goat requires 3.5-5.5% of its bodyweight. Due to
their smaller jaw, goats need more time chewing their food than large ruminants. In terms
of form of feed, goats need to reduce the size of feed by rumination (Delaney, 2012).

A study in which Sargassum spp. was used as fed for sheep, it was observed that
inclusion of Sargassum spp. did not affect palatability and taste of different diets. There
was no significant effect on the feed intake when Sargassum spp. was included, but an
increase in water intake was observed. This observation was because of the large amount
of Sodium (Na) and Potassium (K) in seaweed (Casas-Valdez et. al., 2009). The same case
was observed by Casas-Valdez, et. al (2006) when Sargassum spp. was fed to goats. There
were no significant differences observed between control and the treatment supplemented
with 25% Sargassum spp. in terms of feed intake, body weight and feed conversion but

increased water intake and frequent urination were observed.

STUDY 1. FERMENTATION OF SEAWEEDS USING MOLASSES,
LACTOBACILLUS PLANTARUM 820 AND YEAST AND DETERMINATION OF
ASH, MOISTURE, DRY MATTER, NFE, CRUDE PROTEIN, CRUDE FAT AND

CRUDE FIBER

Abstract

This study was conducted to determine the effect of using molasses, Lactobacillus
plantarum S20, and yeast on the nutrient composition of seaweed. The seaweed was
subjected to heavy metal analysis before subjecting to fermentation. Cadmium and lead
level of seaweed was determined using flame AAS while arsenic was determined using
modified colorimetry. The seaweeds were subjected to anaerobic fermentation for 14 days
using the following treatments: Treatment 1: Seaweed and molasses (no inoculant),
Treatment 2: Lactobacillus plantarum S20 at 1ml/L with 1x10° cfu (Campbell et. al.,
2020), Treatment 3: with yeast at 30g/L at 1.2 x 10® cfu and Treatment 4: 50%
Lactobacillus plantarum §20:50% yeast. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) in a Completely
Randomized Design (CRD) was performed.

Data showed low concentrations of cadmium (0.209 j1g/g), lead (1.40 pg/g) and
arsenic (3.75 g/g) in the seaweed. The proximate analysis of the fresh seaweed showed
the value of crude protein of 8.02 %, crude fiber of 10.56 %, crude fat of 0.63 %, ash of
34.59 %, and NFE of 46.20 %. The proximate analysis of the seaweed after fermentation
for all treatments showed a lower value compared to the fresh seaweed. The crude protein
and crude fiber content of the fermented seaweed was significant (p-value 0.05). Further
studies should be conducted to determine the effect of fermentation methods on different
species of seaweed used for livestock.

Keywords: Lactobacillus plantarum S20., yeast, cadmium, lead, arsenic, proximate

Introduction

Seaweed, particularly Sargassum spp. accounts for 97.96% of the abundant species
of seaweed in Matabungkay, Batangas. This family of Sargassaceae also dominates the
coast of Nasugbu and Calatagan, Batangas. This specie can form from few to several
meters high above the substrate (Cabrera et al., 2015; Ramas, 2011; Saquido, 1999).

Fermented Sargassum using Aspergillus niger, Lactobacillus spp. and
Saccharomyces showed an increase in the nutritive value of Sargassum spp by increasing
the protein and mineral content (Ardiansyah et al., 2018). Lactic acid fermentation
increases lactic acid content which is a key by-product of carbohydrate fermentation. It is
suggested that 12 days fermentation period for Sargassum spp, showed a positive effect on
the lactic acid content with an increase in total and reducing sugars (Shobharani et al.,
2013)

The nutrient composition of seaweed varies depending on the species, season and
sampling technique. Seaweed contains a high concentration of minerals, protein, etc
(Burtin et al., 2003). It is also shown that seaweed has 5-35% protein content depending
on the species (Arakasi et al., 2018). The lipid content of the seaweed ranges from 1-5%
algal DM. Also, it has a content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the form of omega 3 and
6 (Burti, et al., 2003; MacArtain, 2007).

The seaweed from the Genus Sargassum can be added to the diet of goats and sheep
by up to 30% without affecting the intake, digestibility and the growth performance of the
animals (Pereira et al., 2008; Valdez et al., 2008; Valdez et al., 2009) Although brown

algae in comparison to red and green algae contains greater amount of arsenic because of

34

its carboxyl group and its cell wall that is made up of cellulose (Misurcova, 2011; Pomin.
2011).

Heavy metals are naturally found in the environment. Heavy metal toxicity varies
according to dose, manner of exposure, chemical species, and the organism's age, gender,
genetic component, and nutritional status. Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and lead
exposure are known to cause numerous organ damage, which is why they are a public
health concern (Tchounwov et al., 2012).

There are no studies regarding the fermentation method of Sargassum spp. using
molasses with different inoculants and no known value regarding the nutritional content of
fermented Sargassum spp. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect on nutritive
value of fermenting Sargassum spp using molasses and different inoculants. Specifically,
it aimed to:

1. Determine the heavy metal content of seaweed collected off the coast of Lian,

Batangas;

2. Determine the potential sources of heavy metal pollution;
3. Using proximate analysis, determine the nutritional content of fresh seaweed;
4. Determine and compare the nutritional value of Sargassum spp. following

fermentation with various inoculants.

35

Materials and Method

Seaweed Collection for Heavy Metal Analysis

Seaweed samples (Appendix Figure 1) from Lian, Batangas (Appendix Figure 2)
were collected and handpicked and kept in a glass container - properly labelled and
transported to F.A.S.T Laboratories-Brgy. Makiling. Before sampling, a gratuitous permit
(Appendix Table 1) from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)
was secured. The sampling was done by getting five samples from the location with 5
meters distance in each sampling point. An equal amount of seaweed from each sampling
point was brought to the laboratory at Calamba City, Laguna for heavy metal analysis
specifically cadmium, lead and arsenic. The seaweed sample was also authenticated by the
UPLB Museum of Natural History (Appendix Table 2). A 300 g sample was kept in a zip
lock bag with sufficient seawater and placed in a cooler for identification. The stretch of
the shore of Barangay Lumaniag, Lian, Batangas, as well as the nearby Barangays”
(Binubusan, Puting-Kahoy, and Prenza) was assessed to determine the possible cause of
heavy metal contamination in seaweed. The interview was done to determine nearby
industrial companies, farms and such that would affect the amount of heavy metal
contamination in seaweeds. Interviewees include farmers, fisherfolk and citizens living

near the sampling location (Appendix Table 3).

36

Heavy Metal Analysis

Before the fermentation, 200 g of fresh seaweed and 2L of seawater (bottom),
chilled at 4°C was collected and tested for heavy metal content particularly cadmium (Cd),
lead (Pb) and arsenic (As) at F.A.S.T Laboratories-Brgy. Makiling, Calamba City, Laguna.
Collection was done by gathering samples of seaweed and seawater in 5 sampling points
with 5 meters distance each and pulled an equal amount of sample per sampling point to
be tested for the analysis. Identification of heavy metal content in seaweeds was done to
be able to screen the places which possessed the standard limit of the Joint WHO FAO
Expert Committee for the heavy metal content. Areas that appeared to have heavy metals
lower or in the standard limit (Arsenic, 3 mg kg', Cadmium, <5.0 mg kg™ and Lead, <5.0
mg kg™) were the areas where seaweed for the supplementation was collected (Mutia &

Mtolera, 2018).
Fermentation

Seaweed was fermented using plain molasses, Lactobacillus plantarum S20
(BIOTECH-UPLB) and yeast with 2:1 ratio 2-part molasses and 1-part seaweed in
anaerobic condition. The treatments consisting of 3 replicates each were the following:
Treatment 1: Seaweed and molasses (no inoculant), Treatment 2: Lactobacillus plantarum
S20 at Iml/L with 1x10° cfu (Campbell, et. al., 2020), Treatment 3: with yeast at 30g/L at
1.2 x 108 cfu and Treatment 4: 50% Lactobacillus plantarum $20:50% yeast. The treatment
were randomized and analyzed using Completely Randomized Design (CRD). Fermented

seaweed (Appendix Figure 3) was tested for ash, moisture, crude protein, crude fat and

37

crude fiber at Lipa Quality Control Center Inc - Lipa, Batangas. The fermentation process
was done for 14 days in an anaerobic environment. Pails used for the experiment were
sealed using cling wrap and polyethene bag secured with tape, properly labelled with

treatment number, date of fermentation and date of harvest (Appendix Figure 4).
Proximate Analysis

Fermented seaweeds under treatments 1, 2, 3, and 4 were analyzed at Lipa Quality
Control Center Inc. - Lipa, Batangas for crude fat, crude fiber, crude protein, ash, NFE, dry
matter and moisture. The treatment that possessed the highest crude protein content after

fermentation was used as supplement for the animals.

Results and Discussion
Heavy Metal Analysis
The heavy metal analysis of the seaweed and seawater was conducted to be able to
determine the extent of contamination in the collection area. The result of the analysis was

shown in Table1.

Table 1. Heavy metal analysis of seaweed and seawater.

No. Specimen Unit Arsenic Lead Cadmium
1 Seaweeds ug/g 3.75 1.40 0.209
2 Seawater mil/L Less than 0.005* 0.02 Less than 0.003*

According to Hapke (1996), there is no single pathway for heavy metal
accumulation in the food chain. In terms of arsenic, it enters the food chain from the water
into the marine organism, cadmium enters the food chain from the soil into the roots of the
plants while lead enters the food chain from the dust in the air into plants and leaves.
Results of the heavy metal analysis for seaweeds in terms of arsenic level showed a
concentration of 3.75 g/g. This proves the study of Hapke (1996), where an amount of
0.1 to 5 or more mg/kg can be found in fish while 10 mg/kg in fresh matter can be found
in the estuaries and offshore areas. Lead concentration of seaweeds was found to be at 1.40
ug/g. It has been observed that plants used for animal feed and human consumption also
showed lead concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 5 or even 10 mg/kg dry matter. Cadmium
concentration in seaweeds showed a result of 0.209 ug/g. It was stated that the cadmium
level of fresh matter should be at 0.8 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg of dry matter (Hapke, 1996).

Analysis of the seawater showed a low concentration of heavy metals.

Reconnaissance of the Collection Area

The area where the seaweed was collected was located at Brgy. Lumaniag, Lian,
Batangas. This barangay shares common borders with Binubusan, Puting-Kahoy, and
Prenza, Lian, Batangas. The elevation of the said barangay is estimated to be 22.3 feet
above mean sea level. The land area in the upland part of the barangay as well as the nearby
barangays particularly barangay Prenza, Puting-Kahoy and San Diego are primarily used
for planting sugarcane, rice and vegetables crops (Appendix Figure 5), while in most of the
coastal area, people are more engaged in fishing. It was also observed that there are small
resorts located along the stretch of the shoreline of Sitio Lumaniag as well as in Brgy.

Lumaniag.

Interview was done in the area, and consisted of 30 individuals particularly farmers
and fisherfolks. Based on the interview (Appendix Figure 6), particularly in upland areas
(Brgy, Prenza, San Diego and Putting Kahoy), people are engaged in agriculture as most
of them plant sugarcane and rice for living, and vegetable crops for personal use. The
farmers usually plant only twice a year, and the application of fertilizer varies from farmer
to farmer but all of them only use urea to fertilize their crops. Most of them also raised
goats in a backyard set-up. Looking at a possible leaching of fertilizer from the soil going
to the ocean, a small river that runs from the mountain, along the agricultural area, going
to San Diego River (Appendix Figure 7) is one of the possible sources. However, the river
is dry most of the time and it only overflows during the rainy season. The coastal area in
Lumaniag is often used for fishing and resorts. However, it was observed that the area has

not yet been exploited. This may be due to the poor road network going to the beach area.

42

The major river that runs in the municipality of Lian is the San Diego River where most of
the minor rivers were connected and stretch unto the sea. It was also observed that a known
alcohol distillery (Absolut Distillers Incorporated (ADI)), in Lian, Batangas was issued a
cease-and desist order by the local government in 1998 because it was accused of
discharging harmful wastewater into the nearby rivers. The company took a number of
initiatives to address this by introducing viable green technology, where wastewater by-
product was converted into biogas, the slops of the distillery was converted to liquid
fertilizer and distributed to local farmers. The cease-and desist order was lifted in 2004 and
is still operational today (Asian Development Bank, 2011). Therefore, this alcohol

distillery might be a possible source of contamination of the river and the sea.

Based on the result of the heavy metal analysis as well as the interview conducted,
there is a possible source of heavy metal contamination in the area although the

contamination was below the standard limit of all the heavy metals analyzed.

Proximate Analysis of Fresh Seaweed

Proximate analysis was done to determine the moisture, dry matter, ash, crude
protein, crude fiber, crude fat and NFE contents of fresh seaweed. The results are shown
in Table 2.

Table 2. Proximate analysis (%) of fresh seaweed on a dry matter basis.
Ash Crude Protein Crude Fiber Crude Fat NFE

Fresh 34.59 8.02 10.56 0.63 46.20

Seaweed

The results of the proximate analysis relating to NFE showed an amount of 46.20%.
According to a study by Dewinta (2020), protein, ash, fat, and fiber of seaweeds are 5-
35%. 41.52%, 0.30%, and 24.54% respectively. While in the study conducted by Salosso,
(2019), the range of protein content of seaweeds is from 6.44 - 10.64%, ash from 22.56 -
24.11%, fat from 0.94 - 1.99%, and carbohydrate from 46.59 - 50.98%. The result of the
proximate analysis of the fresh seaweeds on a dry matter basis showed that the ash
(34.49%), crude protein (8.02%) and crude fat (0.63%) fall within the range of the studies
of Dewinta (2020) and Salosso (2019), while the fiber content of 10.56% was lower than

the fiber content obtained by Dewinta (2020).

47

Moisture and Dry Matter Content of Fermented Seaweed

Table 3 shows the moisture and dry matter content of the fermented seaweed on a

fresh basis.

Treatment 3 (Yeast) 46.58 53.42
Treatment 4 (Lactobacillus plantarum 49.80 50.20
S20 + Yeast)

Analysis in terms of moisture and dry matter content of the seaweed fermented
using different inoculants showed no significant differences (p-value = 0.2375). There are
no specific studies regarding the moisture and dry matter content of seaweed fermented
with molasses and different inoculants, although a reduced moisture content was observed
in sargassum powder after fermentation with Lactobacillus spp. due to translocation of

nutrients and loss of organic matter by microbial fermentation (Ardiansyah et al., 2018).

Proximate Analysis of Fermented Seaweed
After fermentation, the ash, crude protein, crude fiber, crude fat and NFE of the
fermented seaweeds with different inoculants were determined. The results were analyzed

ona dry matter basis and are shown in Table 4.

The result of the proximate analysis of the seaweeds fermented with different
inoculants showed no significant differences in terms of ash, crude fiber and NFE (p-value
<0.05). However, a significant difference (p-value <0.05) was observed in crude protein
and crude fiber. Figure 4 showed lower value for the ash, crude protein, crude fiber and
crude fat was observed after fermentation. There are number of reasons that might cause
the lower nutritive value after fermentation. One might be the ratio of the molasses and
seaweed where 2 parts of molasses and 1 part seaweed was used. This was inverse to the
process of corn silage making where 2 parts of corn was used per 1 part of molasses.

Another probable reason was the salinity of the seaweed used. According to Davis et al.,

49

(2018), salt has a negative effect on the fermentation process. The salt content of seaweed

might affect the fermentation rate affecting the nutritive value.

Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation

The present study aimed to compare and analyze the effect of fermentation using
plain molasses, Lactobacillus plantarum S20 and yeast in the nutrient composition of
seaweeds particularly Sargassum spp. harvested in Brgy. Lian, Batangas, using proximate

analysis. Significant findings of the study were as follows:

1. Heavy metal examination of seaweed revealed Cd levels of 0.209 ug/g, Pb
levels of 1.20 g/g, and As levels of 3.75 ug/g, all of which are below the
standard limit except for arsenic;

2. The only likely source of heavy metal contamination was the San Diego River,
which received run-off from the surrounding areas. The time span between
when a known distillery released wastewater into the mentioned river and the
time of collection was more than 20 years, which could explain why the heavy
metal discovered in the seaweed was lower than the standard limit. Although it
should also be taken into consideration that heavy metals can also contaminate
water and aquatic organisms via erosion, illegal dumping, corrosion and
leaching;

3. Proximate analysis of fresh seaweed on dry matter basis showed that Sargassum
spp. has 34.59 % ash, 8.02 % CP, 10.56 % CF, 0.63 % CFat and 46.20 % NFE.
This value appeared to be greater than the result showed by fermented
seaweeds. A higher content of ash appeared to be 20.91%, 0.64% for crude

protein, 4.51% for crude fiber, 0.3% for crude fat and lower value of NFE

$1

(28.63%) was determined. Based on the result of the proximate analysis,
treatment 3, seaweed fermented using molasses and yeast was used for the
feeding trial as it possesses the highest crude protein content in comparison to
other treatments;

4. Lower nutritional value was obtained from the seaweed fermented using plain
molasses, Lactobacillus plantarum $20. and yeast compared to the fresh
seaweed. This may be due to the salt content of the fresh seaweed. The study of
Davis, et. al (2018) shows that salt content does have a negative effect on the
fermentation rate. This might be the cause of achieving lower nutritional value
after 14 days fermentation. Another probable reason could be the fermentation
method utilized and the processing of seaweed before fermentation;

5. Significant differences in the crude protein (p-value = 0.0284) and crude fiber

(p-value = 0.0068) of the fermented seaweed were observed.

In conclusion, the study found that fermentation reduces the nutritional content of
seaweed as compared to fresh samples. This result was in contrast with other studies which
prove that fermentation increases nutritive value (Ardiansyah et al., 2018; Shobharani et
al., 2013). Fermentation with various inoculants reveals considerable changes in crude

protein and crude fiber content.

STUDY 2. EFFECT OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTATION OF FERMENTED
SEAWEEDS ON THE GROWTH PERFORMANCE, HEMATOLOGIC
PARAMETERS AND BEHAVIOR OF GOATS (Capra hircus, Linnaeus 1758)

Abstract

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of supplementing fermented
seaweed on the growth performance, hematologic parameters, and behavior of local goats.
Heavy metal analysis was performed on the inputs, which included drinking water,
molasses, and the location of roughage collection. Treatment 1 consisted of 80% Napier
grass 20% Trichanthera gigantea, Treatment 2: 80% Napier grass 20% fermented
seaweeds, Treatment 3: 75% Napier grass 25% fermented seaweeds. The animals were
supplemented with the treatment for a span of 2 weeks. The animals’ growth performance,
specifically its body weight and feed consumption, was documented. Hematologic
parameters and feeding behavior were also evaluated. The data was analyzed using two-
way repeated measures ANOVA.

In terms of supplementing period, significant outcomes were obtained in terms of
animal body weight (p-value 0.05). The impact on red blood cells and total white blood
cell counts, packed cell volume and the experimental animals’ neutrophil and lymphocyte
counts might not be solely due to treatment but with the animal’s health condition. It is
proposed that more research on the effects of fermented seaweed supplements be
conducted. Longer feeding experiments are recommended to further investigate the
influence on the animals’ growth performance and hematologic parameters.

Introduction

There are a lot of studies that have proven the benefits of using seaweed as a
livestock supplement. The use of seaweed can improve the overall health of the animal,
immune function as well as reducing stress that the animal suffers during the intense heat
and transportation (Kannan et al., 2017). It is noted that feeding kelp to an animal suffering
from fescue toxicosis reduces the core temperature of the animal for 3-4 days.
Supplementation of seaweed also improves the fatty acid profile, cholesterol level and
nutritional quality of the animal’s meat. According to Hwang et al., (2014), Undaria
pinnatifida has been shown to improve growth performance in Hanwoo steers, as measured
by gain to feed ration and average daily gain. This may be due to the terrestrial tannin
concentration, which reduces microbial protein degradation. It is also suggested that

feeding seaweed influences the gut microbiota of the organism (Braden et al., 2004).

The effect of seaweed supplementation on hematologic parameters has also been
studied. According to Karatzia et al., (2012), supplementation of seaweed Ascophyllum
nodosum increases blood glucose, decreases blood sorbitol dehydrogenase and no adverse
effect in the hemoglobin, packed cell volume, erythrocytes and total leukocyte count.
Therefore, it has been suggested that utilization of A nodosum in the animal improves

energy utilization and observed to express hepatoprotective effect.

Heavy metals that are found in the earth’s crust are being transported to the bodies
of water through natural events. The huge source of heavy metal contamination in the

environment is through human activities (Bhargava et al., 2012). These metals can affect

56

the organism’s cellular events including proliferation, growth, differentiation, apoptosis

and damage-repairing processes.

There is no study regarding the effect of supplementing Sargassum spp. fermented
using molasses in livestock. As a result, this study investigates the impact of
supplementing fermented sargassum spp. with low levels of heavy metals on goat growth

performance, hematologic parameters and behavior. Its specific goals were to:

1. Examine the influence of duration of feeding fermented seaweed on growth
performance and hematologic parameters, as well as the relationship between time
and treatment;

2. Determine the effect of fermented Sargassum spp. on the animals' body weight and
feed consumption;

3. Determine the influence of low-level heavy metals present in the animal’s blood
using alanine transaminase analysis;

4. Determine the animals’ general health status using the hematologic parameters;

5. Determine the palatability of fermented Sargassum spp. by observing the animals’

behavior.

57

Materials and Methods
Heavy Metal Analysis

The water that was used for cleaning and drinking, as well as the sites of roughage
collection were subjected to heavy metal analysis. The molasses that was used for
fermentation were also subjected to heavy metal analysis. These were done to make sure
that there is little to no exposure to heavy metals aside from the seaweed that was fed to
the animals. Analysis of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and arsenic (As) concentration were done

at F.A.S.T Laboratories-Brgy. Makiling, Calamba City, Laguna.
Housing Preparation

The quarantine building of the Institute of Animal Science- University of the
Philippines Los Banos where the animals are to be confined for the feeding trial was
cleaned and disinfected using sodium hypochlorite (Appendix Figure 8). Prior to loading
the animals, the building was also cleaned and disinfected. The metabolic cages as well as
the improvised cages were also cleaned and disinfected. A plastic mat measuring 30.48cm

x 91.44cm was also installed as flooring.

Experimental Animal

A total of 9 growing male Philippine native goats (Appendix Figure 9) was used in
the study, 7 of which was obtained from the Institute of Animal Science (IAS) and 2 from
Rivad backyard farm in Malinta, Los Banos, Laguna. The animals from the backyard farm
were quarantined for a minimum of 30 days before including it with the animals from the

Institute of Animal Science. The animals were subjected to an acclimation period of 7 days

58

prior to supplementation. The weight of the animal before acclimation period, before,
during, as well as after the supplementation was recorded. The transition of feeding from
their usual to the treatment diets was done by following the 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 until the
animal is given 100% of the treatment diets. The gradual transition was done 3 days before
the target day of full trial which coincides with acclimatization (IACUC Policy 08:
Laboratory Animal Acclimation/Stabilization- Texas Tech University, effective December
11, 2018). Methods of handling the animals was approved by the UPLB Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (Appendix Table 4) The feed that was given to
the animal per feeding as well as feed that was left was also weighed to be able to determine
the amount of the feed consumed by the animals. Treatments were as follows: Treatment
1: control 80% Napier grass 20% Trichanthera gigantea, Treatment 2: 80% Napier grass

20% fermented seaweeds, Treatment 3: 75% Napier grass 25% fermented seaweeds.

Feeding Trial

Hematologic Parameters

Before supplementation and every after a week of supplementation, 5 ml blood
samples were collected 1 hour before feeding in the morning. Blood was collected by
jugular venipuncture using Scc disposable syringe and G21 x 1” needle then transferred
into red capped vacutainer tubes (without EDTA) which were used to collect serum after
blood clots. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Complete blood count (CBC) were
determined. Complete blood count was analyzed at the Animal Disease Diagnostic

Laboratory (ADDL) - Maahas station of the University of the Philippines Los Banos

59

College of Veterinary Medicine while alanine transaminase analysis (SGPT) was
conducted at the Vetsquare Veterinary Clinic- Kalaw Compound, Batong Malake, Los

Banos, Laguna.

Growth Performance

Feed Consumption

The transition of the feeding from the usual diet to the treatment diets was done
gradually by following the 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 ratios until the animal is given 100% of the
treatment diets. The gradual transition was done 3 days before the target day of full trial
which coincided with acclimatization (IACUC Policy 08: Laboratory Animal
Acclimation/Stabilization- Texas Tech University, effective December 11, 2018). Feed
given to the animals where computed based on animals’ 3% body weight. The animals
were given feed in the morning and in the afternoon; half of the ration was given in the
morning and the other half was given in the afternoon. The feed for each animal per day
was stored in a pail labeled with the animals’ treatment and replicate number. The feed
given to the animals was determined on a weekly basis following the animal change in
weight. The feed consumption of the animals was determined on a weekly basis, although
feed refusal was collected daily. The feed refusal was determined by weighing the feed left
in the feeding trough and those that fell on the flooring.

Body weight

The body weight of the experimental animals was determined on a weekly basis.
The body weight was determined every first day of the week during morning before the

animals were given feed for consumption. Since the animals were kept individually in a

60

metabolic cage, animals were weighed individually outside the cage to avoid injury. The
animals were hang with sack as support to determine body weight using a digital weighing

scale (Brifit weighing scale, China).

Palatability and Behavioral Test

Animals were observed 3 times a week to determine the behavioral response
towards the feed supplement. The animal’s reaction and response to feeding of the
individual animal were noted.

A palatability test was done to determine if the supplement was accepted by the
animals. Comparison of palatability was solely based on the observation of the behavior of
animals given supplement and that of the control animals. The components of the feed that
was given to the animal was chopped to an inch size and thoroughly mixed to minimize
the variation in the physical characteristics of the feed that was given.

A camera was installed during feeding to observe carefully all the animals that were
used in the experiment. The camera was installed facing the feeding trough to capture all
the animals’ behavior during feeding. It also served as documentation to record the

animal’s behavior (Appendix Table 5).

Data Gathering

Heavy Metal Analysis: Heavy metal analyses of seaweed, molasses, drinking water, and
the collection site for forage were conducted at F.A.S.T Laboratories-Brgy. Makiling,
Calamba City, Laguna. Cadmium and lead contents of molasses, seaweed, and the site of
forage collection were determined by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)
while arsenic was determined by the modified colorimetric method. The drinking water
was also tested for heavy metal. Cadmium and leads level were determined by 3030 F.
Nitric — HCI Digestion AAS, while arsenic was determined by modified colorimetric
method.

Body weight and body weight gain: The body weight of the animal before
acclimatization, after acclimatization and every Monday of supplementation in a span of 2
weeks were recorded. The body weight gain of the animal was calculated by subtracting

the initial weight from the final weight of the animal.

Feed consumed: Animals were fed with pre-weighed feed per day. At the end of the day,
the left-over feed was weighed again and recorded to get the actual feed consumption of
the animal per day. This served as basis to determine which diet the animal consumed
more.

Initial weight of the feed — Weight of the feed left.

Complete Blood Count (CBC): Blood collection was done before the start of

supplementation, after a week of supplementation and at the end of the treatment. CBC

62

was determined by analyzing 3 ml blood sample collected via jugular vein, stored in a
vacutainer tube with EDTA at the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL) -
Maahas station of the University of the Philippines Los Banos College of Veterinary
Medicine.
Alanine Transaminase (ALT): Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), was
determined by collecting 3 ml blood sample via jugular vein. Analysis was done at
Vetsquare Veterinary Clinic- Kalaw Compound, Batong Malake, Los Banos, Laguna.
Behavioral Response: Behavior of goats was evaluated three times a week for two weeks.
A camera was also installed in the area to record all the behaviors of the animals during
feeding.
Statistical Analysis

Data was subjected to mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) also called Two-way

Repeated Measures ANOVA. LSD grouping and Games-Howell were used for the

comparison of treatments. A significant difference was determined at p<0.05.

Results and Discussion

Heavy Metal Analysis of Feed and Water

The heavy metal analysis of the water used for drinking, as well as the site where
the forage were collected, and the molasses that was used for the fermentation was
conducted. Analysis showed the following result and presented in Table 5.

Table 5. Heavy metal analysis of water, molasses, and forage collection sites.

Note: ** Reporting limit; * Method Detection Limit

Based on the result, all the input that was used for the study has little to no content
of heavy metals. The heavy metals exposure of the animals was solely from the seaweed
itself. Therefore, the water in the area, molasses, grass, and legumes in the collection site

were utilized in the study.

Feeding Trial

Bodyweight Gain

Weight gain was determined on a weekly basis. Data showed the effect of feed
given, time, and interaction between time and feed to the animals subjected to varying
levels of fermented seaweeds. Based on (Appendix Table 6) the Greenhouse-Geisser
epsilon, which at 0.665 does not satisfy sphericity, the result of the univariate test in

ANOVA was adjusted (Appendix Table 7).

Under the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment, there is no interaction on the effect of
treatment on the body weight of goat with time (p-value = 0.738). Since interaction is not
significant, the main effects of time and feed was determined. Results showed that
fermented seaweed had no effect on the body weight of the goats (p-value = 0.999), while
the time of feeding showed significant effect on the body weight (p-value = 0.028).

Table 6. Comparison of time on the bodyweight of goats fed with varying level of
fermented seaweeds.

Note: Values with different letter in the column differs significantly (p-value <0.05)

The result showed that in a span of two weeks of feeding, the body weight of the
goats on week 2 appeared to be significantly different, the bodyweight of the goats

decreased compared to the start of the trial and increased again in week 3 showing

65

similarity with week 1. The decrease in the body weight of the animals after a week of

supplementation might be because the animals were adjusting with the diet provided.

Feed Consumption

Feed refusals were collected daily, and the average weekly refusal was determined
and recorded. This allowed feed consumption to be determined. The average weekly

consumption per treatment is shown in Table 7.

Appendix Table 8 showed the unadjusted univariate test of ANOVA. Based on the
analysis, no significant results were observed between treatments (p-value = 0.904). No
significant result was observed between the duration of feeding as well as in the interaction

of time and feed given (p-value = 0.959).

Hematologic Parameter
Alanine Transaminase (ALT)

The ALT level was determined and recorded. Table 8 showed the result of serum
glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) analysis.

As shown in Appendix Table 9, the Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon is greater than 0.75
but is less than 1.00 therefore results of univariate ANOVA were shown under Huynh-
Feldt adjustment.

Under the Huynh-Feldt adjustment (Appendix Table 10), time and feed formulation
had no interaction effect on ALT (p-value = 0.356). Time likewise has no significant effect

on ALT (p-value=0.588). For the test on the main effect of feed given, Welch’s F-test in

67

the ANOVA was used and showed no significant effect on the response variable (p-value

= 0.275).

Based on Figure 6, the ALT level of the animals that did not receive the
supplementation showed increased value (above normal range). However, the sudden
increase in the ALT level is considered insignificant unless it appeared two to three times
above normal. On the other hand, the animals that received fermented seaweed stayed
within the normal range. This is similar to the study of Raje et al., (2019) wherein the
inclusion of seaweed in the diet of adult goats had no detrimental effect on the liver

function.

Complete Blood Count

Total Red Blood Cell (tRBC)

Red blood cell count was determined under the complete blood count (CBC)

analysis. Table 9 shows the number of red blood cells in goats on a weekly basis.

Based on the graph, data showed that treatment 1 had a high level of tWBC from
that of the week | until the end of the treatment. Treatment 2 and 3 appeared to be on the
normal value before the start of the feeding trial and showed increasing level on week 2
and 3 of the trial. According to Al-Bulushi et al., (2017), sudden increase in the WBC may

indicate an activation of the defense and immune to infection or toxic substances.

Appendix Table 12 showed no significant interaction was observed between the
time and the feed given (p- value = 0.446), therefore the main effect of the time and

treatment was identified. Likewise, analysis showed no significant difference between

72

treatments (p-value = 0.813). Statistical analysis of the effect of the duration of feeding

showed significant difference (p-value = 0.022).

Table 12 showed that week 1 (baseline) was significantly different from week 2
and 3 which was the week when fermented seaweed was given. Data showed a significant
increase in the level of tWBC during the weeks of supplementation.

neutrophil count indicated the same aspect as the increase in the total white blood cell count
where defense and immune function is activated while decreased lymphocyte count is due

to the increasing neutrophil count.

Figure 16 showed that the HgB level in all treatments are below the normal range

Shortage of red blood cells in goats can be a cause of number of reasons, one of which is
nutrient deficiency, deficiency in iron, cobalt and copper can also cause anemia. Goats are
very sensitive to blood loss that even parasite both internal and external can also cause
anemia (Gasparotto, N/A)

Appendix Table 15 shows no significant difference in the interaction of time and the
treatment (p-value = 0. .455). Likewise in terms of the main effect of treatment (p-value =

0.755) and time (p-value = 0.230), significance differences were also observed.

Palatability and Behavioral Test

Animals given fermented seaweed behaved differently in response to the
supplementation. A total of six animals were given fermented seaweed, which were
separated into two treatments of 20% and 25% based on body weight. According to
observations, most animals prefer to eat fermented seaweed before consuming the grass
offered. Some of the animals dug on the feeding trough to get the fermented seaweed
hidden beneath the grasses. During the morning feed refusal collection, it was also found
that there is no evidence of fermented seaweed left for the majority of the animals. A total

of 5 of 6 animals responded positively to the addition of fermented seaweed to their diet.

83

Summary, Conclusion and Recommendation

The purpose of the current study is to determine the effect of fermented seaweed
with low level heavy metals on the growth performance, hematologic parameter and
behavior of the animals. The palatability of the fermented seaweed was also recorded. The

following are the findings of the study:

1. The duration of the feeding affected the bodyweight of the animals. The first
week of feeding showed a significant decrease in body weight indicating that
the animals were still adjusting to the diets provided although the body weight
of the animals started to increase on the second week;

2. The ALT levels of animals that received the fermented seaweed remained
normal, indicating that low level heavy metals identified in the seaweed had no
effect on the ALT level of the animals over the supplementation period;

3. A significant decrease was observed in the number of red blood cells of the
animal although the number was within the normal value;

4. The total white blood cell number was also affected significantly, with data
showing that the level of tWBC of the animals increased above the maximum
normal range;

5. A significant decrease in the value of the packed cell volume was also observed.
The level of PCV decreased with longer time of feeding, but still within the

normal range;

84

6. The neutrophil and lymphocyte counts of the animals were significantly
affected during supplementation. The data showed an increase in the neutrophil
number of the animal and a decrease in the number of lymphocytes;

7. Feeding of fermented Sargassum spp. up to 25% inclusion appeared to be
palatable to the animals.

In conclusion, supplementing fermented Sargassum spp. in the animals’ diet
can be done. Although longer feeding trial is suggested to be able to determine the
extent of effect of supplementation on the growth performance and hematologic
parameter. Furthermore, this study recommends inclusion in the diet of fermented

Sargassum spp. up to 25% of the animals’ daily feed requirement.

CHAPTER VI

GENERAL SUMMARY

Seaweed is known to have a high concentration of nutrients depending on the specie
and season it was harvested. Fermentation meanwhile was utilized to be able to change the
complex compound into a simpler compound to improve nutritive value and convert the
product into a more palatable feed ingredient. There are no studies regarding the effect of
using fermented Sargassum spp. on the growth performance of goats. Hence, this study
was conducted to be able to determine the effect of fermenting seaweeds using molasses
and different inoculants on the nutritional value of seaweeds. It also investigated the effect
of supplementing fermented seaweed on the growth performance, hematologic parameters,
and behavior of goats.

In this study, the heavy metal content particularly cadmium, arsenic, and lead of
seaweed, seawater, drinking water, molasses and the site of collection of forage was
identified. After ensuring that the heavy metal content will solely be coming from the
seaweed itself after heavy metal analysis, fermentation of the seaweed using molasses and
different inoculants followed. Four treatments were used to determine the effect on the
nutritional value of fresh seaweed as follows: Treatment 1: Control (no inoculant),
Treatment 2: Lactobacillus plantarum $20 at 1ml/L with 1x10° cfu (Campbell et. al.,
2020), Treatment 3: with yeast at 30g/L at 1.2 x 10® cfu and Treatment 4: 50%
Lactobacillus plantarum $20:50% yeast. The fermented seaweed was subjected to

proximate analysis after 14 days of fermentation in an anaerobic environment. The

88

fermented seaweed that showed the highest nutritional value was used for the feeding trial.
Philippine native goats were used as experimental animals for the study. The goats were
divided into 3 treatments, Treatment 1: control 80% roughage ,20% legumes, Treatment 2:
80% roughage, 20% fermented seaweeds, Treatment 3: 75% roughage, 25% fermented
seaweeds. Animals were subjected to 2 weeks feeding trial using a high concentration of
supplement to determine the effect of treatment, time, and the interaction between time and
treatment on the growth performance, blood parameters and behavior.

Reconnaissance of the collection area for seaweeds showed possible source of
contamination. However, the time of collection appeared to influence the heavy metal
content as well as the distance of the river to the collection sites. Heavy meal analysis of
fresh seaweed showed values (Cd: 0.209 ug/g, Pb: 1.20 ug/g, As: 3.75 ug/g) below standard
limit. Proximate analysis of fresh seaweed showed that Sargassum spp. has 34.59 % ash,
8.02 % CP, 10.56 % CF, 0.63 % CFat and 46.20 % NFE. Fermented seaweeds were also
subjected to proximate analysis, lower value of ash, CP, CF, and CFat was observed for all
treatments while an increased in NFE content was observed after fermentation. Significant
difference was observed in CP (p-value = 0.0284) and CF (p-value = 0.0068) content
among the treatments. Treatment 3 was used in the feeding trial as it showed the highest
value for crude protein (7.38%) among treatments.

Palatability and behavior of the animals toward the supplement were also observed.
Based on the observation, most of the animals that were offered fermented seaweeds, tend
to eat the supplement first. During the collection of feed refusal in the morning, there was

little to no trace of seaweeds that can be found in the feeding trough. This observation

89

indicates that seaweeds fermented with molasses are palatable to the animal even at 25%
inclusion.

The body weight of the animals was obtained on a weekly basis in the morning
before feeding. No interaction was observed between the time and treatment as well as on
the main effect of treatment itself, although, significant differences were observed in the
duration of feeding. A significant decrease in the bodyweight of the animals compared to
the initial weight was observed in the first week of supplementation and to near the initial
weight after 2 weeks feeding. No significant difference was observed in the feed
consumption of the animals. Blood analysis was done at the start of acclimatization to serve
as a baseline for the blood parameters. The ALT levels of the control group were above the
normal range while those that received fermented seaweeds had levels within the normal
range. Complete blood counts of the goats varied. The tRBC, eosinophils and monocytes,
platelet and packed cell volumes showed normal levels. The tWBC of treatment 1 was
above normal compared to week 1 values, while treatment 2 and 3 showed increased tWBC
compared to the week | that was within the normal range. The neutrophil counts of the
animals that received fermented seaweed were above maximum normal range from the
week | until the end of the trial although the level was lower compared to the week | at
the end of supplementation. Lymphocyte and hemoglobin appeared to be below the normal
range level. Lymphocyte counts in the treatment groups in week 1 were lower compared
to values at the end of the trial indicating increasing level reaching normal value.
Hemoglobin levels of treatment 1 increased almost reaching normal value after the end of

the trial while treatments 2 and 3 remained below the normal value.

90

The animals that were used in the study were limited in number and suffered from
respiratory problem (coughing) that continued until the end of the trial because of
unpredictable weather conditions (rain). This observation might have affected the blood
parameters used in this study. In the preparation of seaweed upon fermentation, no other
process was considered aside from removing the dirt and thorough washing. This might
have had an effect on the proximate analysis.

Therefore, further studies regarding the preparation of the seaweed before
fermentation should be considered to reduce its salt content that might have compromised
the fermentation process. The ratio between seaweed and molasses should also be taken
into consideration as it may affect the nutritional value of the seaweed. Analysis of heavy
metal content and nutritional value of the liquid part after fermentation should also be done
to determine if it can be utilized as organic fertilizer or dietary supplement in livestock.

In terms of identifying the effect of feeding fermented Sargassum spp., a greater
number of experimental animals that are more homogeneous in terms of age, sex, and size
should be considered. Also, securing healthy animals should be prioritized if the immune
response to seaweed will be studied as illness can affect the blood parameters. Longer
feeding trials are also suggested to be able to identify the precise effect of supplementation

on the growth performance and hematologic parameters of the animals.
