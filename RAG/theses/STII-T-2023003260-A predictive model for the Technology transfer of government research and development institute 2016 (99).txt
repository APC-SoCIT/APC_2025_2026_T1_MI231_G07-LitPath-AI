ABSTRACT 

The technology transfer data of the Metals Industry Research and Development
Center (MIRDC) covering the period from 2010-2014 showed that the Center's
penetration rate of each sector of the metals and engineering (M&E) industries, namely
tool and die, machining, forging, metalcasting, electroplating, heat treatment, and
welding, was disproportioned. Metalcasting (49%) was the most penetrated sector while
forging and electroplating (0%) were the sectors least penetrated. Total penetration rate
for the whole M&E sector was low at 14.66%. In addition, the annual transfer rate for
Grant-in-Aid (GIA) research and development (R&D) projects peaked at 40% in 2012-
2013, and dipped to its lowest at 0% in 2010-2011. The total technology transfer rate of
GIA R&D (28%) was significantly smaller when compared to the transfer rate of Contract
R&D (100%). This study aimed to contribute to the improvement of MIRDC's technology
transfer performance through the: (1) development of a model that has the capability to
predict the transferability of both Contract and GIA R&D outputs; and (2) identification of
Critical Success Factors (CSF) for the transferability of these technologies. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique was used to develop the predictive
model because of its capability to quantify relationships between numerical and
categorical variables. The model developed had a 93.75% prediction accuracy and
6 25% error rate. Using Binary Logistic Regression, it was identified that the CSF for the
transferability of MIRDC-developed technologies were project duration, project
value/cost, assistance to the welding sector, and product development R&D type. It is expected that the results of this study will aid key actors in making a more
informed decision, particularly in technology transfer. Such that MIRDC’s Top
Management may be able to formulate evidence-based policies related to R&D project
planning and implementation. In addition, the results may be useful tools in guiding the
MIRDC personnel towards better grasp of the R&D process and how the resulting
technology can be made more effective and efficient for its purpose. Knowing and
understanding the CSFs affecting the R&D technology transfer will enable MIRDC to
effectively channel energy and resources to a more successful R&D project
implementation. This will then redound to more benefits for the M&E industry.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) is the premiere science and
technology body in the country charged with the twin mandate of providing central
direction, leadership, and coordination of all scientific and technological activities and
formulation of policies, programs, and projects to support national development in the
country (www dost.gov.ph, Accessed: 1 May 2016)

DOST defines Research and Development (R&D) as ‘creative work undertaken
on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge of man, culture, and
society and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new application’. The innovation
process is defined as the integration of existing technology and inventions to create a
new or improved product, process, or system (Freeman, 1982)

MIRDC is an attached agency of the DOST and is the sole government entity that
supports the country’s M&E sector It vigorously diffuses various metalworking
technologies, techniques, and innovations needed for the development of the local metal
firms to increase their productivity and enhance their competitive advantages leading to
the creation of both job and business opportunities (www mirdc. dost gov ph, Accessed
4 May 2016)

MIRDC aligns its initiatives with the identified priority areas of the Department
which are strategically focused to support the administration's agenda for national
development. The activities of MIRDC are in line with the mandate of the DOST
especially on the realization of its major final outputs (MFO) which includes Scientific
Research and Development (www.mirdc dost gov ph, Accessed: 1 May 2016)

The Center assists metals and engineering industries as well as other industries
(ie. food, agriculture, transportation and manufacturing) through R&D to come up with
improved products, processes, materials, and equipment prototypes

The M&E industry plays an important role in the economic development of a
country. It is the backbone of major industries and plays a substantial role to the growth
of the country's economy. The industry, although comprised of small independent firms,
cuts across and caters to different sectors (The Philippine Metalworking Industry Study,
2014). The local M&E industry can be broken down into seven (7) sectors (Figure
1)namely: Machining, Metalcasting, Welding, Forging, Too! and Die, Electroplating, and
Heat Treatment. Each sector is further described in Appendix A.

The “project” is the basic unit in the investigation of a specific Science and
Technology problem. it has predetermined objective/s to be accomplished within a
specific time frame (DOST Grant-In-Aid Guidelines, 2008). Driven by a commitment to
create impact, MIRDC engages in two (2) types of R&D project modalities, the Contract
R&D and Grant-In-Aid (GIA) R&D:

* Contract R&D - a short-series type of research wherein all implementation
expenses are shouldered by the customers (Procedures Manual for Acceptance
of Contract and Joint Research Projects, PM-PD 03-06). The source of idea and
direction of the R&D project are provided by the customer in accordance to his
specific needs/requirements

* GIA R&D - projects with allocated funds from DOST or any of its grant-giving
units, including its sectoral councils. DOST's GIA program provides grants for the
implementation of programsiprojects identified in the current DOST priorities and

thrusts and supports science and technology activities classified in the General
Appropriations Act (DOST Grant-in-Aid Guidelines, 2008),

MIRDC has been a recipient of grants from the Philippine Council for Agriculture,
Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD) and the
Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and
Development (PCIEERD), DOST sectoral councils.

The overview process for conducting Contract R&D and GIA R&D summarized
using the Supplier-Input-Process-Output-Customer (SIPOC) Technique can be seen in
Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. The SIPOC model shows how the processes for the
two (2) R&D modalities progresses from idea generation stage to technology transfer
stage.

Figure 3: SIPOC for GIA R&D

MIRDC undertakes Contract and GIA R&D activities to come up with new and
improved products, processes, and materials, as well as equipment prototypes.

Prototype and developmental production using specialized metal casting technologies

and specialized machining processes are done to assist the Micro, Small, and Medium
Enterprises (MSME's) in ascertaining the commercial and technical feasibility of
manufacturing various metal products (Philippine Quality Award Application Report)

The Center's R&D data for 2010-2014 was summarized in terms of number of
completed projects, project value/cost, project duration, sector served, IP availability, and

R&D type as listed below:

* A total of 112 R&D projects was completed of which 78% are Contract R&D while
22% are GIA R&D.

+ There was a decreasing trend in the number of completed projects for Contract R&D

while an increasing trend was observed for GIA R&D.

‘The number of completed Contract R&D projects decreased from 23 in 2011 to 11

in 2014. Inversely, the number of completed GIA R&D projects increased from 2 in
2010 to 10 in 2013. This is the result of MIRDC’s involvement with DOST’s major
R&D programs namely the High Impact Technology Solutions (HITS) and Makinarya

Para sa Bayan (MakiBayan). The Center's prioritization of GIA R&D projects then

reduced the number of Contract R&D projects that it was able to accommodate.


+ The total value/cost of MIRDC completed projects was Php148.950M. GIA and Contract
R&D projects contributed to the total value by 97% and 3%, respectively.

* Individual value/cost classification of completed projects:

+ The completed projects were classified according to the M&E sector to which the
output will primarily be beneficial. The top three (3) M&E sectors served by the
MIRDC through its completed projects were the metal casting, welding, and
machining sectors.

+ Five (5) Intellectual Properties (IPs) were generated from Contract R&D projects
while 13 IPs were from GIA R&D. Among the IPs from GIA R&D, nine (9) were born
out of the two (2) major projects of MIRDC, namely the Automated Guide-way Transit
‘System and the Food Processing Equipment

+ The completed projects were also classified according to their R&D types. The top
R&D types of completed projects were as follows:

- Contract R&D projects: product development, design/drawing, and partprocess.

2. RATIONALE

Republic Act No. 10055 otherwise known as the “Philippine Technology Transfer
Act of 2009" states in its declaration of policies and principles that the State shall call
upon all research and development institutes that perform government-funded research
and development activities to include technology transfer in their strategic mission
(www.lawphil.net, Accessed: 30 November 2016). For the benefit of the Filipinos, results
of governmentfunded R&D must be effectively translated into useful products and
services.

Technology, as defined in RA No. 10055, is either a product, process, practice,
andior innovation. Choi (2009) provided a further definition of the embodiments of
technology. Technology, as a product, involves tools, machines, instruments, or any
objects that are intentionally created to extend practical human possibilities. Technology,
as a process, is concerned with how to use or develop the object effectively. From the
practice and/or innovation perspective, technology is a way to create a new or improved
product, process, or system. However, the invisible aspects of technology such as
knowledge and skills might be much more critical than the physical aspects for the
successful transfer of technology,

Technology transfer is defined in many different ways depending on the discipline
of the researcher and the purpose of the research. The definition of technology transfer
in RA No. 10055 served as the operational definition for this study. It states that
technology transfer is the process by which one party systematically transfers knowledge
to another party for the manufacture of a product, the application of a process, or
rendering of a service, which may involve the transfer, assignment or licensing of
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

‘The MIRDC, being one of the DOST's research and development institutes, has
to pursue the transfer of its technologies developed from R&D projects in accordance
with the provisions of RA No. 10055,

In the U.S. and much of the world, university technology transfer has become an
important mechanism for economic growth. The Association of University Technology
Managers (AUTM) reported that 567 new products based on university or non-profit
research were introduced to the market in 2004 alone. From 1980 to 2004, AUTM cited


the creation of 4,542 spin-off companies from universities, research institutions, and
hospitals. Over 65% of innovations licensed by universities and institutions in 2004 were
granted to small businesses for commercialization purposes (FY 2014 AUTM Licensing
Survey).

Successful technology transfer can have a significant financial impact for both
MIROC, as the transferor of the technology, and to the beneficiaries, as its transferee.
Beyond the financial realm, the benefits may extend to competitive advantages,
enhanced innovation, creation of new markets and birth of new consumers, vibrant
culture of entrepreneurship, and long term advantage such as sustainable economic
growth (Sherer, 2014).

A deeper analysis of the R&D data in 2010-2014 revealed MIRDC’s technology
transfer performance in terms of industry penetration and number of technologies
transferred to the industry.

One of the key measures of brand popularity is industry penetration rate
(Reibstein, 2006). MIRDC’s impact or popularity to the M&E industry can be measured in
terms of industry penetration rate. However, such parameter was not among the
performance indicators currently monitored by the Center

The industry penetration rate for each M&E sector was computed by dividing the
number of transferee firms of R&D technologies developed by the Center with the
number of existing firms, This study focused on the penetration rate of the MIRDC to the
M&E sector firms in the National Capital Region (NCR) since majority of firms in the
country are concentrated in NCR (The Philippine Metalworking Industry Profiling Study
2012)

Table 3 shows that MIRDC’s penetration rate for each M&E sector was
disproportioned. Metal casting was the most penetrated at 49.02% while forging and
electroplating were the least penetrated both at 0%. Further, the Center's total
Penetration rate of the M&E sector was low at 14.66%

Technology Transfer Rate was computed by dividing the number of completed
R&D projects with the number of projects transferred to the industry. Table 4 shows that
in 2010-2014, the total technology transfer rate of 28% for GIA R&D was very small
compared to the 100% of Contract R&D. The annual transfer rate for Contract R&D was
consistently at 100% for the period. Further, the annual maximum transfer rate for GIA
R&D was 40% which occurred among projects completed in 2012-2013 while the lowest
was at 0% in 2010-2011. This data further shows the disproportion of MIRDC’s R&D
technology transfer statistics


In September 2015, DOST issued Administrative Order (AO) No. 009 entitled
“The Technology Transfer Protocol of the DOST-RDIs”. This protocol defined the
policies, strategies, and process/procedures to be adopted by the DOST — Research and
Development institutes (DOST-RDIs) to identify, protect, manage, and commercialize
IPs and IPRs generated from R&D projects funded by the government and to undertake
technology transfer activities, based on RA 10055.

‘AO No. 009 was created to define DOST's policy on IP and lay down the
institutional mechanism for technology transfer activities. This was also intended to guide
DOST attached offices in performing their roles as government-funding agencies and
RDIs.

In compliance to AO No. 009, the MIRDC created a Technical Review Committee
(TRC) represented by technology researchers from various divisions of the MIRDCto
identify potential technologies for transfer/commercialization (AO No. 009, page 8, item
VIlL.1.11). The primary task of the TRC was to conduct an initial evaluation to identify if
the R&D technologies or IPs generated are all set for transfer/commercialization (MIRDC
Office Order No. 15 Series of 2015)

The TRC initially created an evaluation mechanism, which applies for GIA R&D
technologies only, based on (1) criteria for commercialization/transfer of technology; and
(2) completeness of project documents. The criteria for evaluating the technology
readiness for commercialization/transfer of technology and their corresponding weight
can be seen in Table 5. The list of required documents for evaluation as indicated in the
MIRDC Developed Technologies Readiness for Transfer and Commercialization
Evaluation Form can be seen in Appendix C

listed in Table 5 were disregarded


3. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

MIRDC is the sole government agency mandated to offer services that will
directly cater to the needs and requirements of the local M&E industries. Among the
services offered by the Center are (1) Research and Development and (2) Technology
Transfer. Data regarding the Center's technology transfer initiatives from 2010-2014
showed that the Center's penetration rate for each of the sectors of the M&E industries
was disproportioned. The data revealed the following: (1) metalcasting sector was the
most penetrated, with 49% penetration rate; (2) forging and electroplating were the least
penetrated sectors, with 0% penetration rate; (3) the MIRDC was not quite successful at
penetrating the M&E sector in general, with only 14.66% penetration rate; (4) the highest
annual technology transfer rate for GIA R&D, which reached 40%, occurred in 2012-
2013; (5) the lowest and very dismal technology transfer rate of 0% was recorded in
2010-2011; (6) the total technology transfer rate of contract R&D is 100%; and (7) the
total technology transfer rate from GIA R&D was a very poor 28% only

Both the low penetration rate and the low technology transfer rate for GIA R&D
show that majority of technologies that were developed using government funds are
underutilized and the benefits that could have been accrued from the utilization and
transfer to the industry were not entirely felt by the technologies’ potential beneficiaries,
On the other hand, the seemingly low data on technology transfer also meant an
emerging opportunity that there is still potential for MIRDC to reach out to more R&D
technology beneficiaries.

This study aims to find answers to the following problems: How can MIRDC
improve its performance with respect to technology transfer? What variables affect the
transferability of the Center's R&D outputs? More specifically, what factors determine
the success of the MIRDC’s R&D project implementation?


4, REVIEW OF LITERATURE

4.1 Technology Transfer Model

Interest in technology transfer goes back to over six decades (Ramanathan,
1989). Even though technology transfer is not a new business phenomenon, the
considerable literature on technology transfer that has emerged over the years agrees
that defining technology transfer is difficult due to the complexity of technology transfer
process. The definitions depend on how the user defines technology and in what context
(Bozeman, 2000)

Ramanthan (2000) pointed out that the simplest form of technology transfer could
be said to take place when the technology owner (the transferor) transfers the
technology needed by a business partner (the transferee) to sell and service a product
produced by the owner.

Since the early 1970s, models of technology transfer that could facilitate the
effective planning and implementation of technology transfer have been proposed by
technology transfer practitioners. Both qualitative and quantitative models have been
proposed

‘A comparison of the different models developed over the past few decades can
be seen in Table 6

Available studies on technology transfer model are mostly qualitative which often
focuses on the delineation of activities involved in managing technology transfer
(Jagoda, 2007) and on the elements that can influence the planning, implementation,
and eventual success of any technology transfer project

On the other hand, the quantitative technology transfer mode! emphasized the
need for partners in technology transfer projects. Such would be vital in developing skills
in using formal, analytical approaches to generate needed information for a more
efficient technology transfer planning (Ramanathan, 2008).

This study aims to improve the technology transfer performance of the MIRDC by
developing a predictive model using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Technique. The
predictive model using patent analysis developed by Choi et al. was used as reference to
create a more precise technology transfer model based on various statistical techniques
and machine learning algorithms.

ANN is considered as a powerful statistical modeling technique in technical
sciences. A number of authors have shown the interest of using ANNs instead of linear
statistical models (Ibrahim, 2013). This statistical technique was primarily chosen
because of its capability to quantify the relationship between numerical and categorical
data that are part of this study.

4.2 A

ficial Neural Network (ANN)

Predictive modelling is the technique of using historical information on a certain
attribute or event to identify patterns which will assist in predicting a future value of the
same with a certain probability attached to it (Dion, 2011)

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a highly simplified model of the biological
network structure used in engineering, such as in pattern recognition, forecasting, and
data compression (Mandal, et al, 2009)

ANN is trained to perform particular function by adjusting the values of the
connection (weights) between elements (based on a comparison of the output and the
target) until the network output matches the target. This is so that the network can


predict the correct outputs for a given set of inputs. This situation is illustrated by Nasr
(2011) as shown in Figure 4.

The basic component of a neural network is the neuron, also called “node”.
Inputs are represented by ay, az and a, and the output by O,, There can be many signals
to a node which manipulates inputs to give a single output signal. The values W;,, W2,
and Ws are weight factors associated with the inputs to the node. Weights are adaptive
coefficients within the network that determine the intensity of the input signal. Every input
(21, 22...2,) is multiplied by its corresponding weight factor (W,, Wa,...Wq) and the node
assumes summation of these weighted inputs (W,"@1, W2'@2...Wy*a,) to estimate an

output signal using a transfer function.

The other input to the node is the node's internal threshold, b,, also called bias.
This is a randomly chosen value that governs the nodes net input through the following

equation

Equation 1: Bias of Node
Uj = (Wij * ai) + bj


Node’s output is determined using a mathematical operation on the node's net
input in a linear and non-linear manner. One of the most commonly used transfer
function is the Sigmoid Function:

Equation 2: Sigmoid Function

F@)= 7S ossm@si

Ozesmi et al. (2004) listed the advantages of ANN over more traditional methods
as follows: (1) form of relationships need not be specified (no assumptions needed on
the distribution of data; (2) non-linear relationships or interactions among variables are
easily modeled; (3) performance is usually better than general linear models; (4)
complex data patterns can be handled because of their non-linear nature; (5) ability to
generalize to new data. ANN can capture many kinds of relationships, thus, it allows the

user to make a model phenomenon quicker and relatively easier.

ANN has been applied to several fields during last years (Arbib, 2003; Hu, 2003)
However, there are some fields in which the use of ANN's is still scarce; technology
transfer is one of these. Some of the articles published on the application of ANN in
various fields for 2008-2015 are found in Table 7.

5. GAPS IN RESEARCH

The following are technology transfer issues identified in existing studies

* Available studies on technology transfer model are mostly qualitative which often
focus on the delineation of activities involved in managing technology transfer
while studies on quantitative model particularly on predictive modelling are very
sparse (Ramanathan, 2005).

* None of the existing technology transfer mode! developed was capable of
incorporating numerical and categorical data at the same time.

‘* Application of ANN have been applied to a huge amount of fields during the last
years (Arbib, 2003 and Hu, 2003). However, there are some fields in which the
use of ANN is still scarce such as in predicting the transferability of a technology

+ There is no available research on quantitative technology transfer model that has
the capability to predict whether the technology is transferable or not based on
government RDI factors for R&D project implementation

+ There is no available research on technology transfer model that is capable of
identifying the critical success factors under which a government RDI such as
MIRDC will be able to transfer developed technologies to the industry.

This study altempted to address these issues by developing a technology
transfer model using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Technique that will be used to
predict the transferability of technologies developed by the MIRDC. The critical success
factors for transferring these technologies to the industry will also be identified using
binary logistic regression.

8.1 General Objectives

The study aims to improve the technology transfer performance of the MIRDC by
developing a model that has the capability to predict the transferability of technologies
generated from the Contract R&D and GIA R&D projects implemented by the Center.

8.2 Specific Objectives

Specific objectives of this research are as follows:

technologies:

2. To determine the input variables with significant association to the
transferability of Contract R&D and GIA R&D technologies: and

3. To identify the critical success factors for the transferability of Contract R&D
and GIA R&D technologies


9, SIGNIFICANCE

It is expected that the use of the predictive technology transfer model and the
application of CSFs in R&D implementation will increase the number of transferred GIA
R&D technologies to the industry.

The output of this study will help MIRDC Top Management make more informed
decisions and will limit subjective judgments in policymaking and strategy
implementation on its R&D projects

The result of this study is expected to guide the Center's R&D personnel towards
a better understanding of the R&D process and how the resulting technology can be
made more effective and efficient for its purpose. Knowing and understanding the CSFs
affecting R&D technologies transferability will result to a strategic focus and more
efficient channeling of energy in the attempt to successfully implement a project

The stakeholders including the small and medium enterprises in the M&E and
other allied industries, academe, and other government agencies would also benefit from
this study as they will be the direct recipient of a more effective R&D service from
MIRDC. The public resources allocated to develop the R&D. whether it be from the
customer for the Contract R&D or from government funds for the GIA R&D, can be used
efficiently since continuous benefits for new/existing scientific and technological
knowledge is ensured


10. SCOPE AND LIMITATION

1. The study used historical data on completed R&D projects from 2010-2014
culled from various reports submitted to the MIRDC's Planning and
Management Division and to the DOST's Planning and Evaluation Services
Division

2. The MIRDC penetration rate focused mainly in NCR since majority of the
MIRDC customers are from the area, where M&E firms are highly concentrated.

3. The context of technology transfer as discussed in the study only refers to the
context of technology transfer as implemented in MIRDC.


11. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

11.1 Sources of Data

MIRDC's historical data for completed Contract and GIA R&D projects for 2010-
2014 taken from various reports prepared by the two (2) divisions under the R&D
Directorates such as the Materials and Process Research Division (MPRD) and
Prototyping Division (PD) were used in this study

Data such as project title, R&D modality, project value/cost, project duration, and
name of the transferee firms were taken from the performance reports submitted
annually by MPRD and PD to the Center's Planning and Management Division (PMD).
The annual list of applied/approved IPs of the Center were taken from the DOST Annual
Performance Reports. In determining the R&D type of each projects and the specific
M&E industry it serves, assistance from plantila personnel belonging to the both division
was secured

To verify and secure some missing data from the references mentioned above.
the researcher referred to other available documents of the Center such as Job Order
Forms and Job Order Logbooks of the MPRD and PD. Other references used include
“The Philippine Metalworking Industry Profiling Study for 2012", Work Instructions and
Procedures Manual of MPRD, PD, and the Technology Diffusion Division (TDD).

Information on the criteria used to evaluate the readiness of the technologies for
transfer and the evaluation result of R&D technologies was secured from the Technology
Review Committee Secretariat

Unstructured interviews with at least five (5) personnel from the R&D Directorates
who were actively involved in R&D project implementation and were acting in the
capacity of Supervising Science Research Specialist (SRS)/Senior Science SRS were
conducted to gather additional information with regards to the MIRDC’s R&D processes
Results of the interviews were recorded electronically and were later transcribed


A total of 143 projects was initially gathered as data for this study. However,
some attributes of these projects are either lacking or was inconsistent with the other
available reference materials of the Center. A total of 31 projects with such issues was
removed from the list thereby retaining a total of 112 projects composed of 87 Contract
R&D and 25 GIA R&D.

11.2 Identification of Significant Input Variables

Stata Statistical Program Software was used to perform Point Biseral
Computation and Cramer's V. The software will quantify the relationship of the
quantitative and qualitative variables in the study.

Point Biseral Correlation technique was used to determine the measures of
association between the quantitative input (project value/cost and duration) and output
variables (transferability of the technology). The maximum value for the measure of
association is 1 when the variables have a perfect relationship with each other. The (+)
and (-) sign determines whether the variables have a positive or negative association
with each other, respectively.

Cramer's V was used to calculate the strength of association between the
qualitative input and output variables of the technology. The data has four (4) qualitative
input variables namely: R&D Modality, Sector Served, IP Availability, and R&D Type
The value of Cramer's V varies between 0 and 1. Close to 0 shows little association
between variables while close to 1 indicates a strong association

Only the input variables with significant association to the output variables were
included in the development of the technology transfer model


11.3 Development of the Technology Transfer Model

The ANN technique was applied to create a predictive technology transfer model

with the aid of a Spice-Neuro Program. Spice-Neuro is a 3-layer neural network program
with multi-inputs and outputs created by Cao Thang in Japan on 2003-2007

The following procedures were observed to develop the technology transfer model with

the aid of Spice-Neuro software:

11.4 Identification of Critical Success Factors (CSFs)

Critical Success Factors are sets of project variables or factors that are strongly
correlated to project success and whose maximization or minimization, depending on
whether they are favourable or unfavourable, will lead to project success (Ofon, 2003). CSF
represents the few key input variables that were strongly associated to the R&D technology
transferability to the industry

Logistic Regression was performed using Stata Statistical Software to identify the
CSF of R&D projects based on the result of the ANN Technology Transfer Model. Logistic
Regression measured the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one
‘or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using logistic function. Binary


Logistic Regression was specifically performed since the outcome of this model was coded
as: 1-Transferred and 0-Not Transferred.

11.5 Validation of the Technology Transfer Model

The Technology Transfer Model developed using ANN was validated by testing the
R&D project data completed in 2015 in the ANN Technology Transfer Model and Binary
Logistic Model

‘An output tool of the ANN Technology Transfer Model was created using Visual
Basic application as shown in Figure 10. The tool comprised of fields that have to be filled
out in accordance to the 2015 data for completed projects to process the predictive result.
The numerical value and its corresponding prediction is found in the “Status” portion.

The threshold of the predicted value was set at 0.5. Predicted value of 0.5 and above
will register a “Transferred in Industry’ status while value below 0.5 will register “Not
Transferred in Industry’

The same set of data was fitted into the Binary Logistic Regression equation. The

threshold of the computed value was set at 1. Computed value of 1 and above will register

behaviour

MIRDC's Contract R&D is a form of service offered by MIRDC designed to meet the
short-term research requirements of the M&E and allied industries. The customer is directly

involved throughout the entire period of R&D implementation that the direction of the R&D,

the expenses incurred, duration of implementation, the final output, and all the other project

details is subject to his approval. When the project is completed and accepted by the

customer, it is automatically considered as a transferred technology to the industry



Considering the nature of its implementation, all completed Contract R&D of the
Center were automatically transferred to its customers. After 12 months of completion and
acceptance by the customer, an impact assessment is supposedly conducted to determine
the effectiveness and efficiency of Contract Research projects. However, no record was
found to validate the conduct of said assessment.

Meanwhile, MIRDC's GIA R&D is designed to contribute to productivity improvement
and quality of life of Filipinos by generating and promoting appropriate technologies and
problem solution for the M&E and allied industries. These technological interventions are
developed for areas identified in the current DOST priorities and thrusts and to support S&T
activities classified in the General Appropriations Act (GAA). It also aims to strengthen the
technology transfer and utilization, human resources development, information
dissemination, advocacy, and linkages of the Center.

GIA R&D implementation which normally takes six (6) months up to two (2) years or
more to be implemented is supported by government funds. As such, its proposed concept
and budgetary requirements has to pass through a series of evaluation stages prior the
approval of its implementation. Areas for evaluation include: scientific merit; technical,
financial and timeframe; methodology/soundness of implementation; socio-economic impact;
environmental impact; and marketability.

Completed GIA R&D projects may be transferred to the industry through various
modes. However, only a few of these technologies were actually transferred to the industry
from 2010-2014. Another strategy that the Center employed to transfer technologies was to
partner with a project collaborator who is defined as a company or organization who have
expressed willingness to be engaged in the implementation of the project. The
partner/collaborator should have resources or complementary assets necessary to complete
the project. The collaborator and MIRDC enters into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
which states the responsibilities of both parties with regard to managing the technology that

will be generated. Once all the activities stipulated in the MOA is completed, the technology

will be considered as transferred.

A significant observation between the technology transfer implementation of Contract
R&D versus GIA R&D for 2010-2014 is the low transfer rate of GIA R&D to the industry.
Primary reasons identified why most completed GIA R&Ds were not transferred to the
industry


1. Technologies developed by MIRDC has to be subjected for further study to improve
performance functions (i.e. capacity, speed, collection rate) and that several areas
may need to be explored, improved, and optimized. In such cases, developed
technology may not be for public consumption immediately upon completion;

2. Technology developed was not intended to be commercialized but was instead
made to be addition to the facilities/services MIRDC offers; and

3. Some projects are basic research which may take time prior adoption by the
industry. Basic research may have lower expectations for technology transfer
(Wang, M. et. al, 2002). Studies on basic phenomena implies that the benefits are
going to accrue over a much longer term, and perhaps be more indirect than the
benefits that accrue from applied research or development.

The attributes of a Contract R&D can be considered as the essential elements for
technology transfer to take place: addressing customer's needs for products/processes
under their respective unique circumstances and the necessity for the transferee to be
involved right from the planning to the implementation stage of the R&D project. The latter
was emphasized on the Dahiman and Westphal Technology Transfer Model. The lack of
these elements were even mentioned as among the common technology transfer problems
faced by Small and Medium Enterprises (Ramanathan, 2005). These may likewise be the
elements that can be emulated in an effort to increase the number of GIA R&D technologies
transferred to the industry.

Further, performing feasibility studies prior to implementation and impact assessment
after the transfer of R&D technology, important elements of a successful R&D, were non-
existent with GIA R&D implementation mechanism of MIRDC. These include the
performance of feasibility study prior the project development and impact assessment after
the R&D technology was transferred to the industry.

Conduct of feasibility study was part of the phases of the Dahiman & Westphal and
Chantramonklasri Technology Transfer Models and the Technology Transfer Life Cycle
(TTLC) developed by Jagoda and Ramanathan (2005). The TTLC approach takes a holistic
view of a technology transfer project from its “conception” right up to its “conclusion” for
developing a systematic approach for planning and managing technology transfer


According to Ramanathan (2005), technology transfer should not commence without a
careful feasibility study to establish the viability of the technology because such undertaking
usually requires heavy resource commitments.

There is also a need for post-implementation activities that will facilitate assimilation
and modification of the transferred technology. According to RA 10055, transferor of the
technology, in this case, MIRDC, shall conduct an impact assessment on knowledge
translation after a span of three (3) to five (5) years after technology transfer. This is to
facilitate documentation of technology transfer experiences and practices that may lead to.
future innovations. Impact Assessment must be conducted to: (1) ensure that the project
rendered are effective and efficient for its purpose; (2) assess the current status of the
technology; and (3) ensure that continuous project improvement is being implemented
(Procedures Manual of MIRDC’s Prototyping Division [PM-PD 04-02 - Conduct of Impact
Assessment for Contract and Joint Research Projects))

12.2 Significant Input Variables

The R&D project factors are composed of six (6) input variables of which two (2) are
quantitative variables and four (4) are qualitative in nature. Significant input variables were
identified using Point Biseral and Cramer's V for quantitative and qualitative input variables.
respectively

Table 10: Point Biseral for Quantitative Input Variables

Quantitative Point Biseral

P-value
Input Variable | (messure of association) |
~~ Duration 0.6392 /<0.0001

Value/Cost -0.6023 <0.0001

Table 10 shows that at 0.05 significance level. there is a strong negative
association between duration and value/cost and the transferability of the technology
indicated by the negative Point Biseral value of -0 6392 and -0 6023


Table 11: Cramer's V of Qualitative Input Variables

Qualitative

| R&D Modality | 0.8163 <0.0001
Sector Served | 0.6387 <0.0001
IP Availability 0.1848 0.064
R&D Type 0.7533 <0.0001

Table 11 shows that R&D Modality, among the qualitative inputs, had the most
significant association with technology transferability due to its Cramer's V value of 0.8163
that is closest to 1. R&D Type and Sector served also reflected a significant association to
the output with Cramer's V value of 0.7533 and 0.6387, respectively. Only IP Availability has
fo significant association among the qualitative input variables.

Therefore, only the following statements were accepted for Hypothesis 2: X0 (R&D
Modality), X1 (Duration), X2 (Cost), X3 (Sector Served) and X5 (R&D Type). These
significant variables were used to develop the Technology Transfer Model using the ANN
technique.

The insignificant relationship between IP Availability and the transferability of
technology can be attributed to the small number of R&D technologies with applied/approved
IPRs. In fact, for 2010-2014, there was only a total of 18 IPs generated from MIRDC’s R&D
technologies which is roughly 13% of the 112 projects completed by the Center, 28% of this
was from Contract R&D while the 72% is from GIA R&D. Also, 12 out of the 13 GIA R&D IPs
were filed only last 2013. The complete list of MIROC’s Applied/Approved IP can be seen on
Appendix D.

12.3 ANN Technology Transfer Model

A technology transfer model was developed using the ANN Technique making use of
the Splice MLP Program to compute neuron weights and biases, also known as “nodes”


The significant input variables included in the model were: R&D Modality,
Project Duration, Project Cost, Sector Served, and R&D Type while the output variable is the
transferability of the technology.

The model was a fully connected feed forward network with a single input layer
consisting of five (5) neurons, a single hidden layer with five (5) hidden neurons and a single
output layer with one (1) output neuron. The trained information bearing the optimal values
for weights and biases of the neurons resulting to the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE)
was indicated in the Training and Testing tab of the Splice MLP Program as shown in Figure
11:

Activated Function for Hidden Layer: Sigmoid

Number of Trained Data 62
Number of Tested Data: 50

Taken Iterations. 1000

Figure 11: Trained Information of the ANN Model
Source Spice MLP Program

The ANN Model developed has five (5) input nodes, five (5) nodes at the single hidden
layer and one (1) output node. Hence, there has to be 30 (5x5 + 6x1) unknown variable that
‘must be estimated by the network. In practice, two to three times of 30 training data is necessary
to reach an appropriate result for ANN prediction (www researchgate net Accessed 30 May
2015). This study has a total of 112 data (62 Training Data and 50 Training Data) which is a good
starting point to ensure that the optimal number of nodes were used in the model

The model has an MSE of 0003619809 and 0.04747496 for the Training Set and
Testing Set data, respectively MSE is a measure of mean difference between actual and
predicted values. The smaller the MSE, the closer the predicted data to the actual data,
Given that the required MSE for the model is 0.05, the resulting value for both data set was
acceptable. Therefore Hypothesis 3 was accepted

The error in prediction occurred among GIA R&D projects that are actually
transferred but was predicted otherwise in the model. This error was due to the limited

si
number of GIA R&D project data inputted in the model. The 25 R&D project input was only
22% of the total MIRDC data. This means that the number of GIA R&D used as training data

was even smaller. This has caused a difficulty for the model to draw a correct prediction.

The results of the ANN computation of weights of the input, hidden and output nodes
and the biases of the hidden and output nodes can be seen in Tables 12-14,

The detailed prediction result can be found in Appendix E. The summary of the result
of the ANN Technology Transfer model is presented through an output matrix that shows the
performance of the ANN algorithm as seen in Table 15. The row of the matrix represents the
actual output instances while each column represents the instances in predicted output.

The sensitivity of the ANN Technology Transfer model is 92.55% (87/94) while its
specificity) is 100% (18/18). The prediction accuracy is 93.75% while error rate (the
probability that the ANN model will give wrong prediction) is 6.25% (7/112).

The use of a predictive technology transfer mode! developed using ANN with an
acceptable level of performance will help improve the technology transfer performance of the
MIRDC in many ways. The model will be a useful tool for R&D personnel to gain a good
understanding of the variables affecting transferability of the projects. A good understanding
for such will enable them to be better planners of the R&D projects as significant factors for
project transferability are to be taken into consideration. A better planned proposal increases
the chances for a properly executed projects which will lead to the end goal of transferring to
the industry the technology that will be developed out of the project. Thus, Hypothesis 1 was
accepted.


12.4 Critical Success Factors for Technology Transferability

Binary Logistic Regression was used to determine the critical success factors for the
transferability of MIRDC-developed R&D technologies.

Figure 12: Binary Logistic Regression Output Display

Source Stata 12 Siatisical Sohware

Only the input variables with P<0.1 were included in the final Binary Logistic
Regression Model such as the project duration, value/cost and sector served and R&D type.

Equation 4: Binary Logistic Regression
Y = 6.9509 — 0.3396X1 — 0.0358X2 + 3.0973D1 —3.7991D2

Y - transferability of the technology

X, -project duration (in months)

X2 - project value/cost (in hundred thousand)

D,- equal to: 1 if the project sector is Welding or 0 if otherwise

Dz - equal to 1 if the R&D project type is Product Development or 0 if otherwise


Figure 12 shows that the probability of the R&D technology being transferred (p-
value <0.001) was significantly dependent on the four (4) identified predictors namely the
project duration, project value/cost, Welding Sector, and Product Development R&D. Pseudo
R? = 64.38% defined that the variation in transferability of the R&D technology can be
explained by the four (4) identified predictors while the remaining 35.17% can be explained
by other factors not included in the model.

Equation 4 revealed that for every month increase in project duration, the log odds
(logarithmic likelihood) of being transferable decreases by 0.3396. For every hundred-
thousand-peso increase in project value/cost, the log odds of being transferable decreases
by 0.0358. As project duration becomes longer and project value/cost becomes more
expensive, the likelihood that the technology developed from the project will be transferred to
the industry decreases. MIRDC's data revealed that as project duration becomes longer, the
more difficult it is to be completed on-schedule and that the extension period required
towards its completion was also longer compared to when the project duration was shorter.
Likewise, difficulty in maximizing budget utilization increases as the project value/cost
increases. According to Kujala et. al. (2014), complex projects or large projects are
characterized by the following attributes: large size, complexity, uncertainty, and uniqueness.
The wider the scope of the project, the higher is the value/cost of the project and the more
significant the cost if the project gets stuck with the work in progress status. Result of the
Binary Logistic Regression Equation for quantitative data is in agreement with the result of
the Point Biseral computation indicating that Product Duration and Product Value/Cost have
negative association with the transferability of the technology. Therefore, Hypothesis 5 was

accepted.

Equation 4 also states that the log odds of the technology being transferable is
3.0973 times higher for welding sector compared to when it is classified under other M&E
sector while the log odds is 3.7991 times lower if the R&D type is Product Development
Including other M&E sectors and R&D type in the mode! will result to multi-collinearity

13. VALIDATION

14. CONCLUSION

From the analysis and validation of the model, the following findings and conclusions are
made:

1. The technology transfer model developed using the ANN Technique was proven to be
a flexible, rapid, cost-effective, and robust tool for prediction. The model generated
appropriate results at a statistically acceptable value of MSE, sensitivity, specificity,
and reliability values.

2. The model indicated that the significant CSF for technology transfer were: 1) shorter
duration, 2) lower value/cost, 3) welding sector as primary sector served, and 4)
employing R&D type rather than product development

3. The model showed that MIROC’s implementation of R&D has an enormous potential
for improvement. Clearly, MIRDC has focused on transferring short -term R&D
service to requesting customers or partnering with a cooperator with assets and
resources that can implement the R and D project right away. There is not much
consideration on the integrated aspects of technology transfer such as knowledge
‘osmosis, skills internalization , and capability diffusion that go with its physical transfer
‘The model suggests embedding the holistic definition of technology transfer focusing
‘on the significant CSFs for technology transfer for increased penetration and
successful transfer rate

The model also implies that MIRDC could improve its R&D trajectories on sectors with
large number of existing firms, particularly in the tool and die, machining and metal
casting sectors. The probability of success in these sectors with more established
firms are high because the Center is equipped with modern facilities and trained
personnel to accommodate the needs of these industries.

The model also suggest that to improve the transferability of GIA R&D technologies, it
should focus on projects with short gestation periods and market-driven needs
The ANN predictive model could be used as a compass to direct GIA funded projects
of MIRDC and should mimic the features and characteristics of the contract R and D


6. With this ANN predictive model, MIRDC could have a generic technology transfer
model for both GIA and contract R and D that could pro-actively predict a high
probability of transfer and penetration success rate.


15. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

After careful assessment of the results of this study, the following recommendations and
areas for improvement are found necessary for the MIRDC to achieve a more effective
transfer of technology:

1. Incorporate the use of the ANN Predictive Model Tool in R&D during the project
proposal preparation stages of the MIRDC. Proposed factors can be loaded in the ANN
output tool to predict whether such combination of factors will lead to successful
technology transfer to the industry. The predictive result can be used as basis to
modify the proposal, as necessary

2. Develop a separate ANN predictive model and sets of CSFs for Contract R&D and GIA
R&D for better understanding of the variables affecting success in the implementation
and transferability to the industry. This was not performed in this study due to the
limited number of available data that can be processed by the statistical software used
for this purpose

3. Consider the criteria of customer satisfaction in determining the CSFs for technology
transferability which can be done through conduct of survey via phone interview or a
more comprehensive written survey among R&D customers of the MIRDC. The survey
may be distributed among customers prior to release of the productservices availed
from the Center

4. Conduct a study to identify an institutionalized mechanism of MIRDC to measure and
monitor its penetration rate in the industry on a regular basis. For the interim. the
Center may consider adopting the methodology done by the researcher to compute for
the penetration rate. This can be included among the monthly/quarterly report prepared
by the Planning and Management Division for the Center.

5. To further MIRDC’s compliance with the Technology Transfer Law for identification
protection, management, and commercialization, the researcher recommends the
following. 1) strengthen IP education for engineers/technician for them to become
acquainted with how the intellectual property system works, 2) have an additional
technical staff to be trained as patent agents to boost the Center's efforts in generating
more property rights and ensuring protection of intellectual assets, 3) further encourage


researchers to engage in IP disclosure and protection; and 4) consider creating an
incentive mechanism for researchers, which may include, among others, public
recognition, monetary benefits, leave credits, and additional points for career
advancement of engineers/technicians.

Foster new partnerships and strengthen existing linkages with the academe and the
industry as a way for the MIRDC to address its R&D concerns regarding funding, high
impact researches, and adoption of completed technology. Private companies have the
resources to fund capital-intensive research and their intrinsic market orientation helps
ensure its relevance. Universities can become useful for the high quality of talent and
solid research they can offer. The MIRDC, on the other hand, has R&D institutional
support, an active and credible research program, strong research infrastructure and
dedicated research personnel in research, administrative and support

Make a thorough evaluation of the MIRDC’s implementation mechanism for R&D
projects in comparison to that of other DOST RDIs. This can be accomplished through
conduct of benchmarking activities or focus group discussions with personnel from
R&D and Technology Transfer Divisions of the RDIs.
