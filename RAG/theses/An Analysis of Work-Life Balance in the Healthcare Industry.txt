Both business practices and scholarly study have signiﬁcant effects on 
work-life balance. According to the research, work-life balance is an 
important issue which affects well-being because the family and 
profession both are need to keep on priority for most of the persons. Any 
conﬂict amongst the responsibilities of work and family life has a 
detrimental effect on the welfare of the employee. The key aim of this 
paper is to examine the effects on work-life balance as it can be 
understood that the impact of family work conﬂict and work-family 
conﬂict on the health of persons employed in the healthcare sector . 
Levels of family's happiness and well-being has  measured by using 
psychological distress and work satisfaction.
The data analysis revealed that healthcare employees are more stressed 
than other professions, especially nurses and paramedical staff. Because 
of late shifts and overtime, they are less motivated. The salary 
satisfaction level among healthcare professionals is satisfactory . They 
are not happy with the rewards and festival bonus that were given to 
them. However , night shift and overtime are two factors that make life 
difﬁcult for healthcare employees. It is not very easy to make a healthy 
work-life balance because working shifts signiﬁcantly interfere with 
taking care of your family and your job. If taken proper measures by the 
healthcare organisations these problems can get resolved.
Keywords:  work-life balance, healthcare professionals, satisfaction, 
motivation.
Introduction
It can be difﬁcult to maintain a healthy work-life Integration in the 
healthcare industry because employees commonly put their personal 
needs aside for their careers. Work-life balance involves striking the 
right balance between personal and professional objectives, which are 
inextricably entwined by every means.  Night hours, extended 
schedules, fewer breaks, and intense work pressure are just a few of the 
problems that come in the healthcare industry profession.T o advance in 
an organization, one must put in a lot of time in the ofﬁce and handle 
challenging situations. It may be pretty engaging and thrilling some days An Analysis of Work-Life Balance in the Healthcare Industry

Work is the effort a person does to complete a task or 
generate something, whether that effort is physical, mental, 
or both. It refers to a routine, constant action that we engage 
in generating income, typically expressed in monetary 
terms. Non-monetary beneﬁts may also be added to or 
augmented by this monetary income. Life is a condition of 
being characterised by different drives and ambitions,

These motivations and aspirations add stress to one's life 
and have an effect on the work one does.
As a nearly elusive and multidimensional phenomenon, 
"work-life balance" lacks a generally agreed-upon 
deﬁnition. Job-family balance is the "extent to which an 
individual is equally involved in and equally satisﬁed with 
his or her work function and family role," according to 
Greenhause et al. (2003). In other words, there is a positive 
work-life balance when there is job satisfaction and the 
person can perform effectively since there are few conﬂicts 
between the roles they play.
“The degree to which an employee perceives feeling 
fulﬁlled and having his or her needs addressed in both work 
and non-work parts of life" is what work-life balance refers 
to(Rife and Hall, 2015). When a person has a better work-
life balance, he feels better about himself, displays more job 
satisfaction, and exhibits positive work-related behaviours 
including increased productivity , decreased absenteeism, 
and decreased attrition.

There are two main work settings in the healthcare sector:

care (Hussenoederet al. 2021. Hospital-based physicians 
and nurses have lower WLB (work-life balance) compared 
to their outpatient counterparts.and stressful and tense other days. Many people struggle 
with ﬁnding a way to balance their professional and 
personal lives. Employees who feel they don't have time for 
a personal life feel distracted at work. The best way to 
increase work-life balance is to uphold and cultivate a 
healthy workplace where employees have a balance 
between work and family, which will improve one's 
honesty towards their family and job. Negative aspects of 
an employee's personal life can cause job tiredness and 
disturb family relationships. Figure 1 provides the 
conceptual framework of work-life balance. It shed light on 
what professional and personal factors can be responsible 
for maintaining balance in work and personal life. 
Disturbance or changes in any one factor or factors can 
cause serious uproars in work-life balance.
Importance of work life balance
Work should not interrupt on our personal time because it is 
only one component of life. As a matter of fact, the labour is 
a means of support, the opposite is also true. As it promotes

www .pbr.co.inThe WLB situation become more common with the 
occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic especially in the 
healthcare industry (Ghasemi, 2021; Humphries et al., 
2020. The crisis may have affected the WLB of the medical 
staff as they are stretched beyond their maximum working 
limit. They guided about numerous strategies for work-life 
balancing under stressful situations such as a pandemic.
(Khan, 2010) made an effort to assess the effects of job 
satisfaction, burnout at work, work-life balance and conﬂict 
on the intentions of doctors in Pakistan to leave their 
positions. According to the study , burnout at work has a 
considerable impact on doctors' work-life conﬂict and job 
satisfaction but has a little less impact on doctors' ability to 
maintain a healthy work-life balance. The doctor would 
experience more conﬂict in balancing work and personal 
obligations which would lead to job dissatisfaction and 
making them feel  more burnt out at work.
The leading causes of organizational stress among doctors 
are a heavy workload, time constraints, poor 
administration, work/home conﬂict, working nights at least 
twice a week, patient expectations, and emergencies 
(Ifrana, 2012).
Work-life efforts and employee's views about work-life 
conﬂict and the workplace in general are compared. 
Employee's perceptions of work-life balance  is also 
identiﬁed by which advocated that both the employer and 
the employee should share responsibility for it. (Aggarwal, 
2012).
(Shabir and Gani, 2020) found that families are becoming 
more reliant on to bread earners, and a signiﬁcant 
percentage of women are entering to the medical ﬁeld. They 
alsomanage more household chores, child careand elder 
care than males. These personal responsibilities paired with 
those at work have an impact on women employees on a 
physiological and psychological level, creating an 
imbalance between work and life.
The review of literature revealed that the study of work-life 
balance are more focussed on the workers of management, 
IT, bank sector, education sector and other private 
organisations (Rao et. al, 2022; Pahuja, 2016; Kul Shrestha, 
2018). There are a few studies on work-life balance of 
health care workers are available.There is the need for astudy on the WLB of doctors and nurses especially after 
Covid -19 which was a very inspiring situation for health 
workers and resulted in great amount of stress both on 
professional and domestic fronts as well (Rao and 
Shailashr , 2021)
Objectives of the study
1. To determine the stress level of healthcare professional.
2. To determine the elements which affect a healthcare 
worker's ability to balance work and life on the basis of 
stress level.
3. To ascertain whether the employees' work-life balance 
is impacted by the current working environment on the 
basis of their motivation level.

The study found that the most stressed were in the 
administrative staff. This can be justiﬁed by the fact that 
they have to deal with patient's relatives regarding 
administrative problems as well with medical staff. Another 
possible explanation can be that administrative staff are 
understaf fed so their workload is heavy . After admin, the 
nurses are the most stressed. The nurses have to work for 
almost 12hour shift making them overworked and 
exhausted.Paciﬁc Business R eview (Int ernational)

Figur e 3: Response to the question- Do you feel str essed?
Health care employees were asked to indicate the frequency 
of stress faced by them on four point scale ranging from 
rarely (1) to always (4). The table 4 is showing the mean, 
S.D. and C.V. of stress faced by health care employees. It 
can be observed that highest level of stress is being faced by 
admin employees (Mean=3.125) followed by paramedical staff (Mean=3.047) and nurses (Mean=3.045). Among the 
four categories the minimum level of stress was being faced 
by doctors (Mean=2.325), however the coefﬁcient of 
variation is highest for doctors which indicated the 
heterogeneity in responses.

Admin  3.125  1.05 0.34 1 Often  
Although table 4 indicated that health care employees are 
facing stress, but still to measure the signiﬁcance of stress 
faced, following hypothesis has been taken:-
H01:Health care employees are not facing signiﬁcant 
stress
Ha1: Health care employees are facing signiﬁcant stressThe study applied the sample t-test to estimate the 
signiﬁcance of stress faced against the theoretical mean 2.5. 
The results presented in table 5indicates that t-statistic is 
signiﬁcant at 5% level of signiﬁcance for all the employees 
except doctors. For nurses, paramedical staff and admin 
staff, the calculated value of means is higher that the 
theoretical mean (2.5), so it can be concluded that the theses 
employees are signiﬁcantly facing stress at workplace.

www .pbr.co.inwas a little bit surprising. It is seen from the table 6 that, 
though doctors mostly don't feel stressed but they also don't 
feel motivated. Whereas, considering the workload of other 
staff their responses are in agreement with their stress level 
that they do not feel that motivated.
Impact of Employee Stress on Motivation
The review of literature suggested that employee stress has 
inverse relationship with the employee motivation. 
Keeping this in mind this research has taken following 
hypothesis.
H02:There is no signiﬁcant impact of Employee Stress on 
Employee Motivation
Ha2: There is a signiﬁcant impact of Employee Stress on 
Employee Motivation
To test this hypothesis the data of stress was cross tabulated 
with employees' motivation and then chi –square test was 
applied as presented in table 7.  It is indicated from abovetable 6 that out of total 200 
respondents  ,32 respondents i.e., only about 16% said that 
they always feel motivated while 39 % (78) respondents 
said that they do not feel motivated. So, the ratio of 
motivation is very less among healthcare professionals. 
This clearly indicates that they are impacted by the 
dissatisfaction about their work. If we look across the 
different groups, we observe that here doctors' response Table 5: Student's t-test r esults to measur e signiﬁcance of str ess

The study found that the most stressed were in the 
administrative staff. This can be justiﬁed by the fact that 
they have to deal with patient's relatives regarding 
administrative problems as well with medical staff. Another 
possible explanation can be that administrative staff are 
understaf fed so their workload is heavy . After admin, the 
nurses are the most stressed. The nurses have to work for 
almost 12hour shift making them overworked and 
exhausted.Paciﬁc Business R eview (Int ernational)

Health care employees were asked to indicate the frequency 
of stress faced by them on four point scale ranging from 
rarely (1) to always (4). The table 4 is showing the mean, 
S.D. and C.V. of stress faced by health care employees. It 
can be observed that highest level of stress is being faced by 
admin employees (Mean=3.125) followed by paramedical staff (Mean=3.047) and nurses (Mean=3.045). Among the 
four categories the minimum level of stress was being faced 
by doctors (Mean=2.325), however the coefﬁcient of 
variation is highest for doctors which indicated the 
heterogeneity in responses.

Although table 4 indicated that health care employees are 
facing stress, but still to measure the signiﬁcance of stress 
faced, following hypothesis has been taken:-
H01:Health care employees are not facing signiﬁcant 
stress
Ha1: Health care employees are facing signiﬁcant stressThe study applied the sample t-test to estimate the 
signiﬁcance of stress faced against the theoretical mean 2.5. 
The results presented in table 5indicates that t-statistic is 
signiﬁcant at 5% level of signiﬁcance for all the employees 
except doctors. For nurses, paramedical staff and admin 
staff, the calculated value of means is higher that the 
theoretical mean (2.5), so it can be concluded that the theses 
employees are signiﬁcantly facing stress at workplace.

though doctors mostly don't feel stressed but they also don't

Impact of employee motivation on employee's 
satisfaction with work envir onment
Motivation leads to happiness and happiness leads to 
satisfaction, in short a motivated employee remain satisﬁed 
with the work environment. This research also intended to 
measure relationship between employee motivation and 
employees' satisfaction with work environment in health 
care industry . The third hypothesis was taken to serve this 
objective as follows:-
H03:There is no signiﬁcant impact of employee 
motivation on employees' satisfaction with work 
envir onment
Ha3: There is a signiﬁcant impact of employee motivation 
on employee's satisfaction with work environment
To test this hypothesis the data of motivation was cross 
tabulated with employees' satisfaction and then chi –square 
test was applied as presented in table 9.  The table 8 presents the responsesof three criteria related 
for satisfaction .It is clear fromthetable that salary 
satisfaction and non-satisfaction responses was similar 
among the respondents. Half of respondents were satisﬁed 
and half were not. However , if we look closely , it is 
observed that more nurses and para medical staff are 
dissatisﬁed about their salary, 59.1% and 56.2% 
respectively (Figure 5 A). However , few doctors were 
dissatisﬁed with their salary. If we look among the 
respondents who were not satisﬁed with their salary , nurses 
are on the top i.e. 52% of respondents not satisﬁed with their 
salary are nurses (more than half) (Figure 5B). This clearly 
indicates that nurses are underpaid. This fact can be used 
when making decisions regarding nurses' salary bonuses or 
incentives by the management of hospitals.
On closely observing the satisfaction level of 
healthworkers regarding the working environment, it is 
evident that 47.5% were satisﬁed, 31% were very satisﬁed 
and 21.5% were not satisﬁed  (Figure6). So, most of them 
had no complains about their working environment. This 
clearly indicates that healthworkers are rather inclined to 
perform their duties and do not give unnecessary attention 
to other factors.

staff and 75% of admin were satisﬁed, but only 51.1 % of 
nurses were satisﬁed with their performance appraisal  
(Figure 8). Clearly, nurses have the most workload and

are not satisﬁed. Similarly , doctors, paramedical staff and

Present study sheds light on the work-life balance of 
healthcare workers. The term work-life balance has 
emer ged  since 1980s and 1990s when companies in 
America started addressing the issue of work-life balance, 
though it was especially meant for women and children 
(Lockwood, 2003). From the employee perspective, work-
life balance means maintaining an equilibrium between the 
work commitments and family responsibilities. Work-life 
balance of employees can be greatly affected by the work-
life culture of any or ganisation, which can be described as 
the level of an organisation's comprehension about the 
problems faced by their employees in their professional and 
personal lives and degree to which they make efforts and 
take actions towards making the working environment 
plausible for them. Hence, this study is conducted to 
investigate on the work-life balance of workers of hospital 
in Delhi-NCR region, in an effort to know how satisﬁed 
they are working in a hospital setup. The working staff of a 
Figure 8: Responses for Financial Rewards
132Volume 1 5 Issue 12 June 2023
www .pbr.co.inbetter ﬁnancial compensation for their extended work hours 
can be given to alleviate theirs stress level. This was in fact 
the thinking of more than 60 percent of the paramedical 
staff of ABC Health Care, Karnataka, who felt that better 
incentives/rewards for working longer hours would reduce 
the feeling of strain at work (Shivakumar and Pujar , 2016). 
Same conclusion was made in a study by University of 
Western Ontario stating  that pays and beneﬁts played a  
crucial  role  in  determining  employees'  quality of work-
life satisfaction (Pattnaik et al.,2022). If we look at the 
results of present study , all the health workers were fairly 
satisﬁed with the performance appraisal (75.6%). 
Moreover , they were also greatly satisﬁed with the ﬁnancial 
bonus and incentives (82%).So, it may be assumed that 
hard working workers were getting noticed and were 
rewarded with appropriate appraisals as well as the 
incentives or festival bonuses were fairly given by the 
management. This may be the organisation's way of 
keeping the healthcare workers motivated as a 
compensation of their drearier salaries. However, the 
results on the motivation level do not support this 
assumption. 
Working environment also has signiﬁcant effect on causing 
stress to healthcare workers. Gautam and Jain (2018) found 
that workenvironment such as ﬂexible working hours,  
good interpersonal relations with superiors, technology , 
spending quality time  with  family  and  friends and 
support from family  plays  a  very  important  role  in  their  
work  life  balance. In the present study ,all the health-
workers were mostly satisﬁed where only doctors chose the 
option of 'very satisﬁed' (52.5%) more as compared to 
nurses, paramedical staff and administrative whose 
response level was mostly only 'satisﬁed' (51.1%, 50% and 
75% respectively). This result may indicate towards a 
difference in the working environment of doctors and other 
staff of hospital. Also, this may warrant the organisations to 
work towards the improvement of working environments 
more for the workers of hospitals other than the doctors. 
This may seem necessary in light of the suggestion made by 
Pattnaik et al. (2022), stated that negative work 
environments could results low performance and poor  
interpersonal  relationships  among  nurses and could lead  
them  to  leave  the  facility  or  even  the profession hospital consists of Doctors, Nurses, Paramedical staff and 
Administrative workers.
When asked about how stressed they feel in their life due to 
low work-life balance, only 13.5 percent said that they 
rarely feel stressed, implying that most of the health-
workers are in stress though at different levels. Among all, 
doctors  were the least stressed (67.5 % felt stress at 
different levels). But when other staf f is considered, about 
97.4% paramedical staff and 87.6% of nurses were under 
stress at different levels.For nurses, paramedical staff and 
admin staff the calculated value of means are higher that the 
theoretical mean (2.5), so it can be concluded that the 
nurses, paramedical staff and admin staff are signiﬁcantly 
facing stress at workplace. This may indicate a difference in 
inter-departmental stress factors.
On the contrary to aforesaid results the observations made 
on the question of motivation were surprisingly different. 
About 39% of all the health workers did not feel any 
motivation in their lives, even the doctors who were less 
stressed than the other staff workers were rarely motivated 
(42.5%) more than they felt motivation at any level. These 
results may call for a deep inquiry on why and what factors 
are responsible for such low motivation among them. 
However , similar observation was made bySangeetha and 
Roopa Temkar (2020) while doing a study on Work-Life 
Balance of healthcare employees in Bangalore, where 
employees neither feel tired nor energetic about their work. 
The chi-square value is signiﬁcant which leads to the 
rejection of hypothesis so it can be concluded that there is a 
signiﬁcant impact of Employee Stress on Employee 
Motivation. It can be seen that maximum of stressed 
candidates are least motivated which proves that 
employee's stress has negative impact on employees' 
motivation.
The job-satisfaction is an important variable for 
maintaining work-life balance. In fact, a positive 
relationship among stress and job satisfaction was found by 
Balamurugan and Sreeleka (2020).In the present study , the 
job-satisfaction was assessed by using three criteria; salary , 
working environment and night duty and overtime. It was 
observed that more nurses and paramedical staff were 
dissatisﬁed with their salary . Hence, it can be suggested that 
133

rejection of hypothesis so the paper conclude that there is a

satisﬁed with their work environment whereas the least

can be given to alleviate theirs stress level. This was in fact 
the thinking of more than 60 percent of the paramedical 
staff of ABC Health Care, Karnataka, who felt that better 
incentives/rewards for working longer hours would reduce 
the feeling of strain at work (Shivakumar and Pujar , 2016). 
Same conclusion was made in a study by University of 
Western Ontario stating  that pays and beneﬁts played a  
crucial  role  in  determining  employees'  quality of work-
life satisfaction (Pattnaik et al.,2022). If we look at the 
results of present study , all the health workers were fairly 
satisﬁed with the performance appraisal (75.6%). 
Moreover , they were also greatly satisﬁed with the ﬁnancial 
bonus and incentives (82%).So, it may be assumed that 
hard working workers were getting noticed and were 
rewarded with appropriate appraisals as well as the 
incentives or festival bonuses were fairly given by the 
management. This may be the organisation's way of 
keeping the healthcare workers motivated as a 
compensation of their drearier salaries. However, the 
results on the motivation level do not support this 
assumption. 
Working environment also has signiﬁcant effect on causing 
stress to healthcare workers. Gautam and Jain (2018) found 
that workenvironment such as ﬂexible working hours,  
good interpersonal relations with superiors, technology , 
spending quality time  with  family  and  friends and 
support from family  plays  a  very  important  role  in  their  
work  life  balance. In the present study ,all the health-
workers were mostly satisﬁed where only doctors chose the 
option of 'very satisﬁed' (52.5%) more as compared to 
nurses, paramedical staff and administrative whose 
response level was mostly only 'satisﬁed' (51.1%, 50% and 
75% respectively). This result may indicate towards a 
difference in the working environment of doctors and other 
staff of hospital. Also, this may warrant the organisations to 
work towards the improvement of working environments 
more for the workers of hospitals other than the doctors. 
This may seem necessary in light of the suggestion made by 
Pattnaik et al. (2022), stated that negative work 
environments could results low performance and poor  
interpersonal  relationships  among  nurses and could lead  
them  to  leave  the  facility  or  even  the profession hospital consists of Doctors, Nurses, Paramedical staff and 
Administrative workers.
When asked about how stressed they feel in their life due to 
low work-life balance, only 13.5 percent said that they 
rarely feel stressed, implying that most of the health-
workers are in stress though at different levels. Among all, 
doctors  were the least stressed (67.5 % felt stress at 
different levels). But when other staf f is considered, about 
97.4% paramedical staff and 87.6% of nurses were under 
stress at different levels.For nurses, paramedical staff and 
admin staff the calculated value of means are higher that the 
theoretical mean (2.5), so it can be concluded that the 
nurses, paramedical staff and admin staff are signiﬁcantly 
facing stress at workplace. This may indicate a difference in 
inter-departmental stress factors.
On the contrary to aforesaid results the observations made 
on the question of motivation were surprisingly different. 
About 39% of all the health workers did not feel any 
motivation in their lives, even the doctors who were less 
stressed than the other staff workers were rarely motivated 
(42.5%) more than they felt motivation at any level. These 
results may call for a deep inquiry on why and what factors 
are responsible for such low motivation among them. 
However , similar observation was made bySangeetha and 
Roopa Temkar (2020) while doing a study on Work-Life 
Balance of healthcare employees in Bangalore, where 
employees neither feel tired nor energetic about their work. 
The chi-square value is signiﬁcant which leads to the 
rejection of hypothesis so it can be concluded that there is a 
signiﬁcant impact of Employee Stress on Employee 
Motivation. It can be seen that maximum of stressed 
candidates are least motivated which proves that 
employee's stress has negative impact on employees' 
motivation.
The job-satisfaction is an important variable for 
maintaining work-life balance. In fact, a positive 
relationship among stress and job satisfaction was found by 
Balamurugan and Sreeleka (2020).In the present study , the 
job-satisfaction was assessed by using three criteria; salary , 
working environment and night duty and overtime. It was 
observed that more nurses and paramedical staff were 
dissatisﬁed with their salary . Hence, it can be suggested that 
133

www .pbr.co.initself.According to Shivakumar and Pujar (2016), doctors, 
nurses and paramedical staff's work is such that they are 
required to be present at odd hours and hence made to work 
for long hours especially during their night shifts causing a 
conﬂict between their personal and professional roles. As 
can be seen from the result section of the present study , 
there was quite a mixed response obtained, when question 
was asked about their satisfaction level on night duty and 
overtime, majority of health workers felt 
dissatisﬁed(57.5%). This can be attributed to change in the 
attitude of hospitals which now has become more target 
oriented. The workers are given a target for a day, and they 
cannot leave until they have ﬁnished it (Peter and Kavitha, 
2020).
This research also intended to measure relationship 
between employee motivation and employees' satisfaction 
with work environment in health care industry . To test this 
hypothesis the data of motivation was cross tabulated with 
employees' satisfaction and then chi –square test was 
applied.  The chi-square value is signiﬁcant that leads to the 
rejection of hypothesis so it can be concluded that there is a 
signiﬁcant impact of Employee Motivation on Employees' 
Satisfaction with Work Environment. This relationship 
proves that direct relationship between Employee 
Motivation on Employees' Satisfaction with Work 
Environment.
In view of the results of the present study , it can be said that 
the work-life balance of healthcare workers is greatly 
affected by the job satisfaction which include salaries, 
working environment and ﬁnancial rewards. They feel 
stressed and less motivated in their work which may impact 
their personal lives too. This study is only a preliminary 
investigation shedding light on how the health-workers of 
Delhi-NCR region feel about the work-life balance. There 
is a need to conduct more elaborate study in order to 
identify the factors responsible and measures needed to 
address the problem of work-life balance issues in health-
care sectors.  
Conclusion
Thegood healthcare sector play an important role in the 
human life. The promotion of health and the healing, the 
provision of treatmentand the enhancement of people's quality of life are the goals of anyef ﬁcient health care sector . 
Everyhealth/medical expert wish to choose sincerely and 
objectively to make a career in patient care. It has been 
observed from the data analysed that there are factors which 
directly affects the life of healthcare workers.In terms of 
stress level healthcare workers have more stress especially 
nurses and paramedical staff. They have less motivation 
level because of night shifts and overtime work. 
Satisfaction level in terms of salary is satisfactory among 
healthcare workers. They found working environment 
satisfactory . They are not satisﬁed with incentives and 
festival bonus provided to them. But the fact that hinders 
the life of healthcare workers is night shift and overtime. It 
is a challenge in terms of work life balance because to 
maintain healthy work life balance in terms of family and 
work gets seriously affected with shifts.

www .pbr.co.inGermany's economy in recession
The German economy shrank unexpectedly in the ﬁrst three 
months of this year, marking the second quarter of 
contraction that is one deﬁnition of recession. Data released 
Thursday by the Federal Statistical Ofﬁce shows 
Germany's gross domestic product, or GDP , declined by 
0.3% in the period from January to March. This follows a 
drop of 0.5% in Europe's biggest economy during the last 
quarter of 2022.T wo consecutive quarters of contraction is 
a common deﬁnition of recession, though economists on 
the euro area business cycle dating committee use a broader 
set of data, including employment ﬁgures. Germany is one 
of the 20 countries that use the euro currency . Employment 
in the country rose in the ﬁrst quarter and inﬂation has 
eased, but higher interest rates will keep weighing on 
spending and investment, said Franziska Palmas, senior 
Europe economist for Capital Economics.
"Germany has experienced a technical recession and has 
been by far the worst performer among major eurozone 
economies over the past two quarters," Palmas said, 
predicting further weakness ahead. The ﬁgures are a blow 
to the German government, which last month boldly 
doubled its growth forecast for this year after a feared 
winter energy crunch failed to materialize. It said the 
economy would grow by 0.4% — up from a 0.2% 
expansion predicted in late January — a forecast that may 
now need to be revised downward..
The International Monetary Fund predicted that the United 
Kingdom would avoid falling into recession this year after 
previously expecting it to perform the worst among the 
Group of Seven leading industrial nations.IMF Managing 
Director Kristalina Geor gieva said Tuesday that "we're 
likely to see the U.K. performing better than Germany , for 
example.USA Debt Ceiling
US President Joe Biden and House Republican Speaker 
Kevin McCarthy decided to suspend the debt ceiling till 
January 1, 2025. The deal to remove the $31.4 trillion debt 
ceiling is expected to help the US government prevent 
defaulting on its debt. The deal was reached following 
weeks of heated negotiations between Biden and 
Republicans. President Biden believes the deal to be “good 
news” for American people after the tentative deal was 
struck on Saturday night. He said the deal takes the threat of 
catastrophic default away from the table and protects the 
hard-earned economic recovery . The deal still needs to pass 
through the Congress before June 5.
The debt-ceiling agreement that would suspend the debt 
limit till 2025 would cap spending in the 2024 and 2025 
budgets. It would also repurpose the unused COVID funds, 
as well as speed up the permission process for some energy 
projects. The bill, 99-page long, would authorise over $886 
billion for security spending in ﬁscal year 2024 and over 
$703 billion in non-security spending for the same year . It 
would also authorise a 1 per cent increase for security 
spending in ﬁscal year 2025. 
The US Treasury said that the country could run out of 
money to pay its bills as soon as June 1 if the $31.4 trillion 
borrowing limit or debt ceiling is not lifted. If nothing is 
done as soon as possible, it could trigger an unprecedented 
default, which could possibly rattle the markets and push 
the country into a recession. This point was in the making 
for decades. By the end of the 1990s there was a budget 
surplus due to a booming economy , hike in taxes and 
limited spending. But once the dot-com bubble burst, the 
surplus evaporated swiftly . Geor ge W  Bush cut taxes, and 
the country spent in the expensive Iraq and Afghanistan 
wars. In 2008, the recession took place following the 
collapse of the housing sector . Bush as well as his successor ECONOMIC UPDATE
