ABSTRACT

Dendrochirotes (class Holothuroidea: order Dendrochirotida) are diverse and
poorly known suspension-feeding sea cucumbers. Dense multi-species aggregations
of dendrochirotes in Bolinao, Philippines were studied at the level of community,
population and individuals to gather information on their ecology (e.g. diversity and
distribution), behavior (e.g. hiding, emergence and feeding), and taxonomy. Surveys
were done using 1-m² quadrats to document the community structure of sea
cucumbers, particularly their relative abundance, species diversity, sizes and habitat
distribution in three rocky subtidal sites in the western side of Santiago Island. Of the
22 species found, five were cryptofaunal dendrochirotes, namely Actinocucumis cf.
longipedes, Afrocucumis africana, Cladolabes schmeltzii, Plesiocolochirus sp. and
Stolus buccalis. Apart from C. schmeltzii, these dendrochirote species are recorded for
the first time in the Bolinao-Anda reef system. Epibenthic aspidochirotes were rare
across sites, probably due to fishery extraction. Overall distribution patterns of species
and cryptic ecological guilds (i.e. cryptofaunal suspension-feeders and cryptofaunal
deposit-feeders) appear to differ in relation to substrate types, macroalgal cover and
proximity to the fish farms, which is a source of nutrient-enriched water.
Dendrochirotes were more abundant in the site near fish farms (Site 1, Tomasa Point),
particularly S. buccalis which had a mean of 29.5 ± 9.3 ind. m⁻² in bommie substrates. The suspension-feeding behavior, feeding densities and tentacle insertion rates
(TIR; proxy for feeding rates) of Stolus buccalis population in Tomasa Point, Bolinao
were studied in situ and through video recordings, and compared across different
tides, time of day, flow speeds and total suspended solids. Insertions alternated regularly between the large and small tentacles; the latter functions in handling and/or rejecting particles. The overall range and mean values of both TIR and feeding
densities were very high, with 7-23 insertions min⁻¹ (mean 15.6 ± 3.2) and 0-80 ind.
m⁻² (mean 16 ± 17), respectively. Sampling in the afternoon had significantly higher
feeding densities and TIR than at other times of the day. TIR was highest during high
tide (16.9 min”) and during flow speeds >5 cm s⁻¹ (16.5 min⁻¹), whereas feeding
densities did not differ with the tides and flow speeds. Significant positive feeding
responses to the increased particle concentration were detectable at the population
level through large proportions of feeding animals, as well as at the individual level
through small increases in TIR. The external morphology, internal anatomy and ossicles of the five common
dendrochirote species in Bolinao (the subjects of the ecological studies) were
taxonomically described to provide bases for their identification, and to identify
morphological variants among them. Taxonomic accounts were provided for
Actinocucumis cf. longipedes, Afrocucumis africana, Cladolabes schmeltzii,
Plesiocolochirus sp. 1 and Stolus buccalis. Additional eight major morphological
variants within Actinocucumis (4), Plesiocolochirus (2) and Stolus (2) were
distinguished for further studies testing the possibilities of cryptic species complexes
or synonymies with better known species. Comparisons with original species
descriptions and their synonyms reveal systematic uncertainties that require re-examination of type specimens and a comprehensive review of the relevant genera.

CHAPTER 1:

General introduction

Sea cucumbers or holothurians (class Holothuroidea) are an abundant, diverse
and distinctive group of echinoderms that typically have elongated bodies, prominent
feeding tentacles, and usually lack skeletal structures except for their calcareous ring
and microscopic dermal ossicles. They are widely distributed in the marine
environments from the arctic seas to tropical lagoons, and from shallow-water
habitats such as tide pools, seagrass beds and coral reefs to the deep ocean (Kerr &
Kim 2001), and consist of over 1,730 species belonging to the orders Aspidochirotida,
Dendrochirotida, Apodida, Elasipodida and Molpadida (WoRMS 2015). Well-known
sea cucumbers consist mostly of commercially important, deposit-feeding
aspidochirotes (Aspidochirotida), which have been extensively studied in recent
decades (e.g, taxonomy, ecology, hatchery culture, and fisheries management) mainly
as a result of the global threat to their fishery (Conand 2001). On the other hand,
suspension-feeding dendrochirotes (Dendrochirotida) have received relatively limited
research attention, apart from morphological descriptions of new species.
Dendrochirotes are comprised of 11 families, 130 genera (45 of which are monotypic)
and ~766 recognized species names, or ~44% of known extant sea cucumber species
(WoRMS 2015). Cucumariidae Ludwig 1894, Phyllophoridae Oestergren 1907,
Sclerodactytidae Panning 1949, and Psolidae Forbes 1841 are the largest
dendrochirote families, which together comprise >90% of dendrochirote species.

Dendrochirotes are characterized by their 10-30 long, highly-branched and
mucus-coated tentacles adapted for feeding on organic particles and planktonic
organisms suspended in the water column (Clark & Rowe 1971, Kerr 2000). Many
species have a cryptic lifestyle, hiding in crevices of hard substrates (e.g. Aslia
lefevrii, Thyone roscovita and T. elegans in McKenzie 1991) or buried in sediment

(c.g. Psolus phantapus in McKenzie 1991 and Phyrella spp. in Michonneau & Paulay

2014) and can thus be difficult to detect. They depend on ambient flow to deliver food
Particles for their suspension feeding, which is perhaps why they favor areas of
moderate to high water movement (McKenzie 1991) and are almost absent in the deep
sea (Hansen 1975). High-density, multi-species aggregations of dendrochirotes have
been reported in both temperate (e.g. McKenzie 1991) and tropical areas (e.g. Forbes
et al. 1999), but few quantitative studies have been done to understand their diversity
and ecology. Aspects of their distribution and feeding are only known for several
temperate-water species, particularly Cucumaria frondosa (Hamel & Mercier 1998,
Singh 1999, Singh et al. 1999, Holtz & MacDonald 2009 and Nelson et al. 2012),
Roweia stephensoni, R. frauenfeldi frauenfeldi, Pseudocnella sykion and Aslia
spyridophora (Foster 1994). Aspects of their reproduction are known for many
temperate and Antarctic species (for examples, see McEuen 1988, Foster 1994,
O’Loughlin 1994, Alcock & O'Loughlin 2001 and O’Loughlin et al. 2009), but only
for a single tropical species (i.e. Afrocucumis africana; see Chao et al. 1995).
Knowledge on dendrochirotes of the Philippine archipelago has been limited to
taxonomic and faunistic accounts of Semper (1868: mostly Bohol), Sluiter (1901:
Tawi-Tawi), Domantay (1934: Puerto Galera; 1962: Hundred Islands), Cherbonnier &
Féral (1981: deep sea) and Reyes-Leonardo (1984: Bolinao and Sorsogon). In 2009, a
reef-wide survey of the sea cucumber populations (with focus on aspidochirotes) in
the Bolinao-Anda reef system (Olavides et al. 2010) found four undetermined
dendrochirote species in high densities on the western side of Santiago Island,
Bolinao, particularly in Tomasa Point. Tomasa Point is in close proximity to the
mariculture zone of the Guiguiwanen Channel and to the Bolinao Marine Laboratory
(BML) of the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UP-MSI). The.

presence and high densities of these dendrochirotes in this particular area presented

excellent opportunities for conducting a series of studies on the ecology and
taxonomy of these taxa.

The primary aim of this thesis is to improve the knowledge on the ecology,
behavior and taxonomy of the dendrochirotes found in Bolinao. The first study
(Chapter 2) describes the species composition, community structure, spatial
distribution, diversity, and microhabitat utilization of the sea cucumber communities
in the western side of Santiago Island, with focus on dendrochirote species. This study
guided the design of the second study, and provided most of the specimens for the
third study.

The second study (Chapter 3) examined the population densities and feeding
behavior of Stolus buccalis, which is among the most abundant sea cucumber species
in Bolinao (based on Chapter 2, Olavides et al. 2010 and pers. obs.) and had the
largest tentacles (up to ~2.5 cm long) among the dendrochirote species found. The
main objectives of this study are to document the feeding behavior of S. buccalis, and
to determine if the changes in the density of feeding individuals and tentacle insertion
rates (TIR) of these animals in their natural habitat are responses to the differences in
the amount of near-bottom suspended solids (TSS) and flow speed, which have been
determined in other studies as important factors related food availability and feeding
efficiency (e.g. on Cucumaria frondosa: Hamel & Mercier 1998, Singh 1999, Singh
et al. 1999, Holtz & MacDonald 2009, Nelson et al. 2012). Sampling was replicated at
different tidal cycles (i.e. spring and neap), tidal phases (i.e. low, flood, high and ebb)
and the time of day to investigate if these factors are interrelated with with proximate
environmental factors (TSS and flow speed) and suspension feeding activities.

The third study (Chapter 4) provides taxonomic accounts of the dendrochirote

species in Bolinao based on detailed examination of their external morphology,

internal anatomy and ossicle characters, primarily to serve as bases for species
identification (e.g. in Chapters 2 and 3). Critical reviews of species synonymies and
their taxonomic histories were done to assess the reliability of the current species
diagnoses and to provide recommendations for resolving systematic uncertainties.
Potential cryptic species (from morphological variants) were also identified to provide

bases for future studies that would seek to clarify species limits and diagnoses.

CHAPTER 2
Community structure and habitat utilization of dendrochirote and aspidochirote
sea cucumbers (Echinodermata: Holothuroidea) in high-energy reef flats of

Santiago Island, Bolinao, Philippines

Abstract

The unregulated fishing of commercial sea cucumbers in Bolinao has lead the
depletion of epibenthic species and the exploitation of poorly known, low-value
cryptofaunal species. Using 1-m* quadrats, surveys were conducted to describe the
species diversity, relative abundance, size structure and habitat distribution of sea
cucumbers in three rocky, high-energy sites. Cryptic behavior and feeding mode (i.e.
deposit- or suspension-feeding) of each species were used in categorizing them into
ecological guilds. Twenty-two sea cucumber species were found, seven of which are
new records for the Bolinao-Anda reef system, namely, Actinocucumis cf. longipedes,
Afrocucumis africana, Plesiocolochirus sp., Stolus buccalis, Holothuria immobilis,
Labidodemas pertinax and L. rugosum. Species richness was relatively high in all
sites, but quadrats were dominated by a few species (1.7-2.3 effective number of
species). The distribution of the common species, Actinocucumis cf. longipedes,
Cladolabes schmeltzii, S. buccalis, H. hilla, H. difficilis, H. fuscocinerea and H.
impatiens, were significantly clumped (standardized Morisita’s index >0.5). The
dendrochirote S. buccalis was the most dominant species, with a mean of 29.5 +9.3
ind, m? in bommie substrates during peak feeding emergence in the aftemoon. In
coralline slabs substrates, H. difficilis had the highest density (mean 14.3 +6.6 ind. m”
?). Canonical Correspondence Analysis of the common species provided insights on
the relative importance of substrate types and the possible influence of organic

nutrient loading from fish farms on species distribution.


A. Introduction

Knowledge on the diversity and distribution patterns of tropical sea cucumbers
(Holothuroidea: Echinodermata) have accumulated over the past decades, although
much of it are limited to conspicuous, deposit-feeding aspidochirotes (order
Aspidochirotida) of commercial interest. Field surveys involving manta tows and belt
transects underestimate the abundances of small-sized, nocturnal and cryptofaunal
aspidochirotes (Kerr et al. 1993, Eriksson et al. 2012) and especially dendrochirotes
(order Dendrochirotida). Little is known about the community ecology of
cryptofaunal sea cucumber species, especially of dendrochirotes, which comprise
44% of the sea cucumber species in the world (~766 of 1730, WoRMS 2015).

Dendrochirotes are suspension-feeders that possess 10-30 long, richly-branched
and mucus-coated tentacles (Clark & Rowe 1971). They are more prevalent in the
temperate and polar regions than in the tropics (Birkeland 1989). Being passive
suspension-feeders, their populations are largely restricted to coastal areas of
substantial water movement (Young & Chia 1982, James 1984, McKenzie 1991).
Some temperate-water species can dominate hard-bottom communities, often
occupying surfaces or crevices of hard substrates, along with other invertebrates or
macroalgae, in dense monospecies (Rutherford 1973, Young & Chia 1982) or
multispecies aggregations (McKenzie 1991, Foster 1994). The high densities or
biomass of dendrochirote populations in some areas may have considerable effect on
the benthic community structure and the quality of the surrounding water through
extraction of plankton and organic nutrients (e.g. Cucumaria frondosa; Nelson et al.
2012).

Two dendrochirote species, Actinocucumis typica Ludwig 1875 and Cladolabes

schmelizii (Ludwig, 1875), have been previously reported in Bolinao, Philippines


(Reyes-Leonardo 1984). Our recent survey of the sea cucumber resources in Bolinao-
Anda reef system found 4 undetermined dendrochirote species that co-occurred in
dense aggregations in Tomasa Point (Olavides et al. 2010). Due to their small sizes,
large numbers and hiding behavior, their densities and distribution were difficult to
determine with transects, a method primarily designed for large, epibenthic species.
The main aim of this study is to describe the structure of cryptofaunal sea
cucumber communities, with focus on dendrochirote species, in the rocky, high-
energy areas of the western side of Santiago Island, Bolinao, which has been heavily
impacted by mariculture and fisheries activities. This study determined the species
composition, diversity, relative abundances, body sizes and various aspects of the
spatial distribution of the sea cucumber community in relation to broad environmental
factors and specific habitat variables. As far as we know, there has been no published
information on the abundance, distribution and diversity of tropical dendrochirote

species.

B. Materials and methods
1. Survey locations and sites

Preliminary surveys of sea cucumbers in the Bolinao-Anda reef system across
25 sites (covering 37,500 m2) indicated that the main populations of dendrochirotes
are located across Tomasa Point in the southwestern tip of Santiago Island (Olavides
et al. 2010). The extensive taxonomic survey conducted by Reyes-Leonardo et al.
(1985) for the same reef system only detected dendrochirotes in Lucero in the western
side of Santiago Island. Although small populations of dendrochirotes were also
found in cursory surveys on the reef edge across the western side of mainland Bolinao

(Trinchera Point) and around the eastern side of Santiago Island (Malwak sandbar),


their restricted and ephemeral presence in these areas precluded further studies. The
study was conducted at three sites, with ~1 km intervals, within the shallow (1-5 m),
rocky subtidal areas on the western side of Santiago Island. Site 1 (Fig. 2.1) is a
subtidal boulder field <SO m away from the rocky shores and outcrops of Tomasa
Point, at the northern border of the Guiguiwanen Channel. Site 2 is in the rocky reef
flat <100 m away from Bungao beach, with greater exposure to waves than Site 1.
Site 3 is a wave-exposed rubble flat ~400 m away from Lucero beach, located
between a seagrass meadow and an algal ridge. Based on pre-sampling observations,
the intertidal (0-1 m) and deeper areas (10-20 m) of each site had very few sea

cucumbers.

2. Field surveys

Data on species density, richness and diversity of sea cucumbers were
collected using scuba in the three sites on 24 January 2012 during daytime (09:00-
17:00). Using 1-m quadrats, adaptive sampling (Bakus 2007) was done by placing
the quadrat on areas with >25% hard/rocky substrates, which provide suitable habitat
for many sea cucumbers (Dzeroski & Drumm 2003), at ~5-m intervals. Ten replicate
1-m? quadrats were sampled per site. To find concealed individuals, crevices and
macroalgal strands were examined, rocky substrates were overturned, and the top 5—
10 cm layer of the underlying soft sediments was dug by hand. Recording of sea
cucumbers was done in the following sequence: (1) epibenthic individuals; (2) crevice
or hole-dwelling suspension-feeders, usually with only tentacles protruding; (3)
individuals concealed within macroalgae or under boulders; and (4) species that bury
or burrow. Apodida species were excluded due to operational and taxonomic

difficulties. Upon completion of the sea cucumber survey within each quadrat, the


planar surface coverage (%) of macroalgal types/species and the underlying substrates
were estimated for the same quadrats, with the aid quadrat’s grid having 324 squares.
The substrates as “soft” (mud or sand), rubble (dead coral fragments <25 cm in
diameter), boulder (dead coral fragments 30-100 cm in diameter), pavement
(cemented, flat limestone), bommie (immovable degraded corals, 2-3 m in diameter)
and slab (dead table acroporids, 0.5-2 m in diameter) (DZeroski & Drumm 2003,
Eriksson et al. 2012).

Another set of survey was conducted on 23 February 2012 to gather additional
information on the two most abundant species, Stolus buccalis and Holothuria
difficilis on substrates not adequately sampled in the first survey. In Site 1, six 1-m?
quadrats were placed on top of bommies where tentacles of S. buccalis were
previously observed to emerge from. The number of S. buccalis individuals was
monitored at 09:00, 12:00 and 15:00 to determine whether densities of S. buccalis
change with time within the same quadrat. In Site 3 at 16:00, six 1-m” quadrats placed
ontop of slabs were surveyed for H. difficilis.

Qualitative surveys on species presence, microhabitat utilization and behavior
of sea cucumber species were done from January-March 2012. Concealed
microhabitats surveyed were “under sand,” “under rock” (all rocky microhabitats),
“inside rock holes/crevices” and “macroalgae,” whereas exposed microhabitats were
“top surfaces of rock,” “on rubble,” and “on sand.” Burying, burrowing and feeding
behaviors (i.e. rhythmic extension and withdrawal of tentacles) were also noted for
each species. Each species was categorized into ecological guilds based on both
feeding mode and microhabitat utilization (Kerr et al. 1993). Species whose bodies
are mostly or completely concealed under substrata, within crevices or holes of rocky

substrates, or among macroalgal structures are considered cryptofaunal. Epibenthic


species are those that lie exposed (usually feeding) on top of substrates for substantial
periods of the day, including those that bury or cover itself partially with sand at other

times.

3. Specimen collection for measurements and species identification

Specimens were collected from within the quadrats and within a ~500-m?
search area after surveys were completed at each site. Extraction of some specimens
required chipping off dead coral fragments with a dive knife or collecting fragments
that sheltered diminutive or embedded individuals. Overturned rocks were returned to
their former positions. Large specimens (=100 mm) were measured in the boat and
immediately returned to their habitats to minimize impact on the populations. The
animals were left to stabilize in containers with seawater before measuring total body
length (5 mm) using a measuring tape. Smaller specimens (<100 mm) were brought
to the laboratory, relaxed in 7.5% MgCl-seawater solution for about an hour, and
measured for total body lengths (+1 mm) using a caliper. Several specimens were
preserved in 75% ethanol for species verification and taxonomic studies (Chapter 4).
Most species were identified through their external morphology, but some required
examination of ossicles. Whole animal photos and tissue samples of each
morphospecies were sent to Gustav Paulay and Frangois Michonneau (University of

Florida) for COI sequencing and review of species determination.

4, Data analyses

The sea cucumber communities were characterized per site in terms of the
number of species and their average densities (ind. m) for the 24 January 2012

dataset. Shannon H’ index values were calculated and converted to their linear


equivalent, the effective number of species, ENS=exp(H’), which is the number of
equally-abundant species required to give a particular index value, for a more intuitive
interpretation of diversity (Jost 2006). Non-parametric pairwise Kruskal-Wallis test
‘was used to compare densities and ENS among sites, at class levels. Standardized
Morisita’s index of intraspecific aggregation (I,) was determined for abundant species
at each site. At 95% confidence limits, I,-value larger than 0.5 indicate a significantly
clumped distribution, close to zero a random distribution, and lower than -0.5 an even
distribution (Krebs 1999).

For the combined 24 January and 23 February 2012 datasets, length frequency
distributions of all species were visualized for all sites (pooled) using a boxplot and
operationally categorized as “small” if the animal is <50 mm, “medium” if 51-150
mm and “large/long” if >150 mm. Relationships between the densities of abundant
species and habitat variables (substrate and macroalgae cover) were investigated
through canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and visualized with an ordination
diagram or biplot using R 2.11.1 GUI 1.34 (R Development Core Team 2010) with
“vegan” package (Oksanen et al. 2011). A categorical environmental factor, “fish
farm influence,” was added to explore potential effects of broad factors at the scale of
site. “Fish farm influence” was ranked (1 through 3) based on the likely impact given
flow direction of effluents from the fish farms to the sites, which is northward from
the mouth of the channel (Udarbe-Walker & Magdaong 2003), thus, Site 1 (Tomasa
Point, ranked as 3)>Site 2 (Bungao, rank 2)>Site 3 (Lucero, rank 1) (Fig. 2.1; see also

rankings by Villanueva et al. 2006).


C. Results
1, Site and habitat characteristics

All sites had very low cover of seagrass, no live corals, mostly degraded
coralline substrates colonized by turf or macroalgae, shallow waters and moderate to
high exposure to waves or tidal currents. Except for the slabs, which were only found
in Site 3, the mean percent cover of hard (73-88%) and soft substrates (13-27%) were
comparable across sites (Kruskall-Wallis p>0.05). Mean algal cover (31-41%; Fig.
2.2B) was high in all sites and occupied much of the hard substrate surfaces.

Site 1 had mostly structurally complex substrates dominated by bommies and
boulders, mostly silty sediments, and the densest cover of Halimeda, Caulerpa and
turf algal species (Fig. 2.2). Site 2 had similarly high planar surface cover of boulders,
Halimeda and turf algae in comparison to Site 1. However, the boulders and bommies
of Site 2 appear to have less surface complexity and lower profile, while the soft
substrates were less silty. Site 3 is characterized by the abundance of highly eroded,
low-relief substrates, particularly large acroporid rubbles and slabs, the dense cover of
Sargassum and low cover of turf algae. Halimeda cover differed very significantly
between Sites 1 and 3 (10% vs 3%, Kruskal-Wallis p<0.01). Caulerpa and Padina

were only encountered in Sites 1 and 2, whereas Sargassum only in Site 3.

2. Diversity, relative abundances and densities of sea cucumbers

A total of 22 sea cucumber species was found during the study, only 13 of
which were within quadrats (Table 2.1). Species comprising the sea cucumber
communities were partitioned into three guilds: cryptofaunal suspension-feeders (all 5

dendrochirote species; described in Chapter 4), cryptofaunal deposit-feeders (14


aspidochirote species; see photos in Appendix A) and epibenthic deposit-feeders (3
aspidochirote species), Epibenthic aspidochirotes were not found inside the quadrats
and were rare in the sites, thus further analyses pertain only to cryptofaunal guilds.
Although aspidochirote species richness was high in all sites, no more than 2 species
occurred in a quadrat, which contributed to its low mean ENS across sites (1.0-1.13;
Fig. 2.4C). Dendrochirotes contributed more substantially to the species diversity of
sites. Site 1 had the highest dendrochirote diversity (1.9 +0.6 ENS), and is
significantly higher than those in Site 3 (1.13 +0.3 ENS; Kruskal-Wallis p<0.05).
Overall sea cucumber diversity did not differ significantly among sites (1.72-2.26
ENS).

Dendrochirotes densities were significantly greater at Site 1 than at other sites,
whereas aspidochirote densities were significantly greater at Site 3 than at other sites
(Fig. 2.4B). Dendrochirotes dominated (96%) Site 1 (Fig. 2.3), with Stolus buccalis
having the highest abundance (55%) and population density (mean 13 ind. m),
Dendrochirotes also dominated Site 2 (72%), represented by Cladolabes schmelizii
(32%), S. buccalis (21%) and Actinocucumis cf. longipedes (19%). Holothuria
difficilis (65%; mean 7.7 ind. m) and A. cf. longipedes (29%) were the only common
species in Site 3. Overall, the most abundant species were S. buccalis (36%), A. cf.
longipedes (20%), C. schmeltzii (18%) and H. difficilis (19%). Holothuria
fuscocinerea, H. impatiens and H. hilla were relatively few but common enough by
aspidochirote survey standards (20.5 ind. m7”), All of the common species, ie. A. cf.
longipedes, C. schmelizii, S. buccalis, H. hilla, H. difficilis, H. fuscocinerea and H.
impatiens had significantly clumped distributions in all three sites (standardized

Morisita index, Ip>0.5, a=0.05).


At Site 3, Holothuria difficilis had significantly higher densities in slab-rubble
(mean 14 ind. m*; Fig. 2.5B) than boulder-rubble substrates (mean 7.7 ind. m?;
Kruskal-Wallis p<0.05). The densities of Stolus buccalis in predominantly bommie
substrates at site 1 did not significantly differ from those in predominantly boulder
substrates (12 vs. 13 ind. m®), which suggest that both bommies and boulders provide
similarly suitable substrates for this species. Among temporal replicates in bommies,
the mean densities of S. buccalis increased by 140% between 09:00 and 15:00

samplings, from 12 to 30 m® (Fig, 2.5A).

3. Body lengths

A total of 428 individual sea cucumbers were measured (Fig. 2.6). Only six
species were represented by >20 samples and together comprised the 85% of the data,
while half of the species had <5 samples each. Most aspidochirote species were
medium length (50-150 mm) and only Holothuria coluber, H. immobilis and H.
leucospilota were typically over 150 mm long. Only four small species (mean <50
mm; Stolus buccalis, Cladolabes schmelizii, Actinocucumis cf. difficilis and H.

difficilis) attained densities >1 ind. m?.

4. Species-environment relationships and microhabitat utilization

Partitioning of the mean squared contingency coefficient in the CCA showed a
total inertia of 2.38 and that the variables explained a total of 1.24 of inertia or 52%,
leaving 48% unexplained. The first axis, CCA1, contributed 65% of the explained
inertia while the second axis, CCA2, contributed 15%, which together explained 80%
of the “variance” in distribution. The ordination of species along the measured

substrate variables and the “fish farm influence” factor is shown in the biplot (Fig.


2.7). CCA was strongly associated with fish farm influence while CCA2 was most
associated with boulder cover. Stolus buccalis and Cladolabes schmelizii were
positively correlated with the variables in CCAI (e.g. fish farm influence and
Caulerpa spp. cover) whereas Holothuria difficilis and Actinocucumis cf. longipedes
showed the opposite relationship; each of these species differed in their relationship
with a combination of substrate types. The distributions of H. hilla and H. impatiens
were positively correlated with CCA2 variables (e.g. boulder and soft substrate
cover), while those of H. fuscocinerea appeared to be only correlated with rubble

cover.

D. Discussions
1. Species diversity and densities

Of the 22 sea cucumber species found during the study (Table 2.1), 7 are new
records for the Bolinao-Anda reef system, namely, Actinocucumis cf. longipedes,
Afrocucumis africana, Plesiocolochirus sp., Stolus buccalis, Holothuria immobilis,
Labidodemas pertinax and L. rugosum. Photographs of cryptofaunal aspidochirotes
are presented in Appendix A while taxonomic descriptions of dendrochirote species
are provided in Chapter 4. There is now a total of 50 sea cucumber species known
for the entire reef system, from the 27 recorded by Reyes-Leonardo et al. (1985) and
the 35 recorded by Olavides et al. (2010; see combined inventory in Appendix B).
The focal sampling of smaller areas enabled greater scrutiny of complex surfaces and
cryptic spaces, which in turn allowed better representation of the diversity of small
and inconspicuous species, while the additional free-swimming searches enabled the
presence of rare or less abundant species to be recorded. However, the effective

number of species or the number of equally abundant species was generally low for


both aspidochirotes and dendrochirotes in all sites since each 1-m? patch surveyed
was dominated by one or two species. Site 1, where all five dendrochirote species co-
occurred, had the highest dendrochirote and overall sea cucumber diversity. The few
studies on sea cucumber communities that provided diversity indices have much
larger sampling units (e.g. 500 m? belt transects by Olavides et al. 2010), thus no
meaningful comparisons can be made apart from species richness.

Except for a few species, densities of aspidochirotes rarely approached 1
individual per 10 m. Consequently, aspidochirote densities have been typically
expressed in individuals per 100 m? or per hectare (e.g. Olavides et al. 2010, Eriksson
et al. 2012). The majority of aspidochirote species found were medium-sized (50-150
mm long; Fig. 2.6) and with lightweight vermiform body, which are of little or no
commercial value. Our previous study that covered large areas and various habitats
throughout the Bolinao-Anda reef system used belt transects and roughly estimated
the mean densities of H. impatiens, H. hilla, and H. fuscocinerea to be 9.3, 4.0 and 4.5
individuals per hectare, respectively (Olavides et. al. 2010), which fell below the
ballpark “threshold density” of 30 ind. ha’! provisionally considered by Purcell et al.
(2009) as critical for effective repopulation of broadcast-spawning aspidochirotes.
The estimated mean densities of these species in the suitable, rocky habitats of the
western side of Santiago Island (Fig. 2.4A) were two orders of magnitude higher than
in the previous study, and conversion to ind, ha” can result to values well above the
threshold density (i.e. ~357 ind. ha for H. impatiens and ~143 ind. ha’ for both H.
hilla and H. fuscocinerea). The large differences in estimates may be mainly due to
the differences in survey methods and the more thorough search of cryptic

microhabitats in this study.


The highest mean density (14.3 ind. m?) for aspidochirotes was represented
by the smallest species (15-46 mm), Holothuria difficilis, found mostly under the
slabs at Site 3 (Lucero). This estimate is between the reported highest mean density of
0.9 ind. m for Rarotonga, Cook Islands (rubble/rock habitat on the leeward side of
the reef, Drumm 2004) and ~130 ind. m? at Eniwetok Atoll, Marshall Islands (on
sand under slabs, during the day; Bakus 1968). Foraminiferans, which are
hypothesized to be the preferred diet of H. difficilis along with bacteria (Bakus 1968),
are abundant in the sediments of Lucero (Dizon & Yap 2003, pers. obs.).
Decomposed Sargassum and sea urchin (Tripneustes gratilla and Salmacis
sphaeroides) feces were also common in the area, which may provide additional
source of detritus and bacteria.

Dendrochirotes are generally thought to be scarce in tropical reefs (Bakus
1973, Birkeland 1989), and more prevalent in temperate regions, where they can
occur at very high densities of >10-500 m* (reviewed in Foster 1994). The
predominance of Stolus buccalis, Actinocucumis cf. longipedes and Cladolabes
schmeltzii at Sites 1 and 2 may indicate that the conditions at these sites are very
favorable for these species. The most dominant sea cucumber species, S. buccalis,
usually hid within the cryptic spaces of bommies and boulders, and can only be seen
in abundance when suspension-feeding (pers. obs.). Density estimates doubled
between morning and afternoon sampling in the same patches (Fig. 2.5), indicating
that these values refer only to their apparent densities related to their emergence and
feeding activity, which may be affected by temporal or environmental factors (studied
in Chapter 3). The sampling date (23 February 2012) coincided with the shift from
spring tide to neap tide in Bolinao; the morning sampling (09:00) was during flood

tide whereas the afternoon sampling (15:00) was during low tide (NAMRIA 2012).


Although the changing tide may be a factor, further studies with adequate replicates
are required to determine any pattem. In the temperate dendrochirote species,
Cucumaria frondosa, the densities of feeding individuals have been found to vary in
relation to the changing tides (Hamel & Mercier 1998), phytoplankton concentration
(Singh et al. 1999) and water velocity (Holtz & MacDonald 2009). Based on field
observations on the feeding behavior of S. buccalis, the concentration of suspended
particles (food availability) as influenced by water velocity may be one of the factors
that affect diel variation in relative abundance of emergent and feeding individuals
(see discussions in Chapter 3). Thus, at least for some dendrochirote species,
responses to environmental cues are apparent at the population level even at short

temporal scales.

2. Species distribution in relation to environmental variables, microhabitats,
morphology and behavior

The co-occurrences and clumped distributions of species at each site may be
related to common microhabitat utilization or requirements (see Table 2.1),
particularly substrate attachment for suspension-feeding dendrochirotes and sheltering
for nocturnal aspidochirotes. The CCA for the seven most common species indicate
that the distribution of each species differed in relation to the substrate and macroalgal
cover of their habitat, and their proximity to the fish farms (Fig. 2.7).

Holothuria hilla and H. impatiens were always on soft sediments that were
hidden under rocky substrates or lodged in the undersurfaces of boulders and
consequently, they appear associated with these substrates in the CCA. These species
often occurred in monospecific clusters and appear to share similar niche, gross

morphology (e.g. medium length, vermiform body) and “fugitive” behavior (e.g.


shelter in cryptic microhabitat and emerging only at night, feed on sediments while
their posterior body is concealed under rocks). Evidence for interspecific competition
(e.g. competitive exclusion) among sea cucumbers is lacking and difficult to
demonstrate, that is, in contrast to resource or niche partitioning, which has been
inferred for tropical sea cucumber communities at the level of reef zones,
microhabitats (Roberts 1979, Massin & Doumen 1986, Kerr et al. 1993), sediment
grain size (Roberts 1979, Massin & Doumen 1986) and even nutritional value of
feeding patches (Uthicke & Karez 1999).

Holothuria fuscocinerea was only associated with rubble cover in the CCA
but have been observed in numerous microhabitats (e.g. under boulders, on top of
tocky substrates, in seagrass beds, under live coral heads) around Bolinao. Among all
species found, H. fuscocinerea (along with H. pervicax) appears to be among the most
“vagrant” or highly mobile sea cucumbers, perhaps related to its very soft body and
numerous, well-developed ventral podia. Although this species is predominantly
reddish-brown in dorsal ground color, they are often greyish when encountered in
exposed substrates due to a coating of mucus and fine sediments. In a previous study
in Lucero (in and around Site 3) by De Guzman (1990), H. fuscocinerea (along with
H. pulla) was among the macroinvertebrates not associated with any of the
environmental variables in detrended canonical correspondence analyses.

Actinocucumis cf. longipedes and H. difficilis were negatively associated with
fish farm influence and frequently co-occurred at Site 3. Holothuria difficilis was
more associated with slabs whereas A. cf. Jongipedes more with rubbles close to the
Sargassum beds. In both species, body lengths were similar (mean ~25 mm; Fig. 2.6)
and products of asexual reproduction through fission (viz. truncated about half-way

across the body, missing either anterior or posterior body section) were common.


Actinocucumis cf. longipedes (along with S. buccalis) was the most ubiquitous
dendrochirote at all sites and co-occurred with most species. In contrast, H. difficilis
was found only at one site and co-occurred, apart from A. cf. longipedes, only with
three other cryptofaunal aspidochirotes that readily eject Cuvierian tubules, namely H.
fuscocinerea, H. impatiens and H. leucospilota (Table 2.1).

Cladolabes schmeltzii and S. buccalis were positively associated with fish
farm influence and usually co-occurred at Sites 1 and 2 (Fig. 2.7). Cladolabes
schmeltzii was more common in crevices and undersurfaces of boulders and in
Halimeda, which it usually shelters in or attaches to when feeding. Stolus buccalis
were most numerous in crevices and holes of bommies, which were also densely
covered (mean 19%) with Caulerpa. Stolus buccalis was never found to shelter in
macroalgae, and almost always hid their bodies inside cryptic spaces. Thus, most
individuals were detected only when their tentacles were protruding on top surfaces of
rocks. Their tentacles overhang low-profile macroalgae (e.g. Caulerpa) but not over
complex forms of macroalgae (e.g. Halimeda), which probably limit their access to
the water column. Macroalgal species cover and associated dendrochirote distribution
may indicate response to environmental conditions commonly favored.
Eutrophication (San Diego-McGlone & Ranches 2003), changes in phytoplankton
composition (Azanza et al. 2006), sedimentation and deleterious effects on corals
(Villanueva et al. 2006) around the study sites have largely been attributed to the
intensive fish farming activities that began in the late 1990’s (Verceles et al. 2000).
While numerous negative effects on biological communities have been linked to the
fish farm effluents, suspension-feeding dendrochirotes, especially S. buccalis, have

proliferated under these conditions.


Further studies on the population and community ecology of sea cucumbers in
Bolinao and other localities should investigate the relationships between species traits
(i.e. morphology and behavior), distribution, and diversity with microhabitats, other
environmental parameters, and biological interactions (e.g. predation and
competition). There is inadequate knowledge on these topics for many sea cucumber

species, especially dendrochirotes.

3. Implications for resource management and biodiversity studies

While this study reported almost the same number of species for Site 3 or
Lucero as the taxonomic survey of Reyes-Leonardo et al. (1985), the composition
differed substantially between the two studies, which may be related to the fishery
exploitation of the species (Table 2.2). Nine of the 11 large, epibenthic aspidochirotes
reported by Reyes-Leonardo et al. for Lucero were not found during the study (nor in
our surveys from 2007 to 2012) while 11 additional cryptofaunal species were found.
Depletion of epibenthic sea cucumber populations became evident in Bolinao in the
late 1980s (e.g. McManus & Meiiez 1989). De Guzman (1990) estimated that in 1988
alone a total of 14.7 tons were extracted from the reef flats of Lucero, a major
invertebrate fishery area in Bolinao. The lack of regulation has gradually led to the
serial depletion high-value epibenthic species and even the inclusion cryptofaunal
aspidochirote species with little or no market value (Olavides et al. 2010). The
marked change in community structure in Site 3 (Lucero) with more cryptofaunal
suspension- and deposit-feeders compared to the mid-1980s may also be attributed to
the chronic nutrient loading from the milkfish cage culture in southwestern section of

Santiago Island. However, the differences in the research methods and priorities (e.g.


focus on epibenthic vs. cryptofaunal species) among the studies on sea cucumbers are
also important factors in the differences in species composition.

The species richness of shallow-water sea cucumbers in the Bolinao-Anda reef
system can be considered highly diverse, given that 50 species were recorded in the
~25,500 m? area surveyed (Olavides et al. 2010; or 0.01% of the 240 km? total reef
area; Alifio et al. 1993), The species richness in Bolinao is comparable to those
reported in much larger areas, particularly in Guam with 65 species (from around a
541-km? reef area; Michonneau et al. 2012) and the Spermonde Archipelago,
Indonesia with 56 species (from 9 stations by Massin 1999; within a ~2800 km*
coastal area; Pet-Soede et al. 2001). More sea cucumber species and better species
information are likely to be found in Bolinao, given that this work had limited area
coverage and two previous reef-wide studies were limited by search methods and

focus.

CHAPTER 3:
Daytime feeding behavior and activity of Stolus buccalis (Stimpson 1855)

in Tomasa Point, Bolinao, Philippines


Abstract

In situ suspension-feeding behavior and densities of the dendrochirote sea
cucumber Stolus buccalis (Stimpson 1855) were studied in observational plots in the
shallow subtidal area of Tomasa Point, Bolinao. Video recordings were used in
describing 13 sequences of feeding behavior, and in estimating tentacle insertion rates,
(TIR), which served as proxy for feeding rates, across different tide cycles, tide
phases, time of day, near-bottom flow speeds and total suspended solids (TSS).
Insertions of large and small tentacles altemated regularly with no significant
variation, The small tentacles were observed to function in particle handling, and
post-capture rejection of large particles. Feeding densities ranged from 0 to 80 ind.m?
(mean 16 +17) while TIR from 7 to 23 insertions min (mean 15.6 +3.2). Both
feeding densities and TIR were significantly higher during the spring tide (20.9 ind.
m”? and 16.3 min") than at neap tide (11.1 ind. m? and 15.2 min’). TIR was
significantly higher during high tide than at flood tide (16.9 vs. 15.1 min"), while
feeding densities did not differ significantly with the tide phases. Sampling in the
afternoon had significantly higher feeding densities and TIR than those in the
morning or noon, respectively. Only TIR differed significantly between low and high
flow speeds (14.7 vs. 16.5 min"). Significantly higher TIR (16.7 vs. 14.4 min“) and
feeding densities (21.5 vs. 6.3 ind. m®) were observed during sampling periods with
high TSS than at low TSS. The results indicate that positive feeding responses to the
increased particle concentration available for suspension feeding are detectable at the
population level through large proportions of feeding animals, as well as at the

individual level through small but significant increases in TIR.


A. Introduction

Several mobile echinoderm taxa can visibly influence reef community structure
and function through their trophic interactions when they are highly abundant (e.g.
sea urchins can control macroalgal overgrowth; Acanthaster planci can consume or
degrade the coral colonies; Birkeland et al. 1988). Epibenthic sea cucumber species
(mainly aspidochirotes), however, feed lower in the food chain as deposit feeders and
their influence on the reef environments is less noticeable since it occurs primarily
through the processes of bioturbation and nutrient recycling, which may enhance
productivity (Uthicke & Klumpp 1998, Uthicke 2001). Aspidochirote species may
either move and feed on patches of sediment with higher organic matter content
(Uthicke & Karez 1999, Mercier et al. 1999, Slater 2010) or actively select organic
particles from the sediments (Massin 1982, Hammond 1983).

Dendrochirote species, on the other hand, are essentially sessile, passive
suspension feeders that rely on current-borne particles for their feeding, and are often
found in coastal areas of substantial water movement (McKenzie 1991). Knowledge
of their feeding behavior and ecology is scarce, except for a few species, such as
Cucumaria frondosa (see Hamel & Mercier 1998, Singh et al. 1999, Holtz &
MacDonald 2009, Nelson et al. 2012). Studies on C. frondosa indicate that (1) the rate
of tentacle insertion is a reasonable indicator of food ingestion (gut content; Holtz &
MacDonald 2009), (2) the proportion of individuals feeding in a population increases
with increasing phytoplankton concentration (Singh et al. 1999), (3) there is an
optimal range of flow speed for suspension-feeding (Holtz & MacDonald 2009), and
(4) that C. frondosa has a high assimilation efficiency (mean ~70%) with great
potentials to effectively extract excess organic load at aquaculture sites (Nelson et al.

2012),


The shallow subtidal area of Tomasa Point, Bolinao has the highest reported
population density for Stolus buccalis and among any sea cucumber species in the
Bolinao-Anda reef system (see Chapter 2). This species aggregates in rocky patches,
and their bodies are almost always imbedded within the holes and crevices of
coralline substrates, with their tentacles extended into the water column only when
suspension-feeding. The eutrophication of the nearshore waters of Bolinao due to the
intensive milkfish (Chanos chanos) mariculture industry has caused harmful algal
blooms (San Diego-McGlone et al. 2008) and coral degradation (Villanueva et al.
2006). This condition may, in contrast, be highly favorable for suspension-feeders,
such as S. buccalis.

The main aim of this study is to obtain information on the feeding behavior and
ecology of Stolus buccalis, which may help explain their high-density distribution in
the area affected by the fish farming industry. Field observations and underwater
video recordings were done to provide an ethological description of the tentacular
movements related to feeding. The field sampling was designed to determine whether
feeding behavior, densities of feeders and feeding rates change in response to
different levels of near-bottom total suspended solids, near-bottom current/flow

speeds, tides (cycles and phases) and the time of day.

B. Materials and methods
1. Site and sampling scheme

The study was conducted in Tomasa Point, Santiago Island, northwestern
Philippines (Fig. 3.1; Site 1 of Chapter 2) in a shallow, subtidal area <50 m away
from the rocky shores and outcrops, at the northern border of the Guiguiwanen

Channel. The complex substrates of the site are dominated by bommies and boulders


(dead corals) with dense cover of Halimeda spp., Caulerpa spp. and turf algae, while
the soft sediments are mostly silty sand. Tidal currents primarily drive water
circulation in the Guiguiwanen Channel and the coastal waters of Bolinao,
influencing local water exchange patterns and current velocities (Rivera 1997,
Udarbe-Walker & Magdaong 2003, Gecek & Legovic 2010). The tides in Bolinao
alternate between a long semidiumnal and a short diurnal cycle (one high and one low
water daily) within a 14-day period (Rivera 1997); these cycles correspond to the
neap (minimal tidal ranges) and spring (maximal tidal ranges) tides, respectively.
Oceanic water enters the channel (generally southward) during the flood phase and
water from the channel exits (generally northward) during the ebb phase (Rivera
1997, San Diego-McGlone et al. 2008). The mean current velocity at the site is ~6 cm
s' (Gecek & Legovic 2010).

The selection and delineation of the observational plots, and the testing of
sampling methods were done prior to the study (23, 27 and 30 March 2012). Nine
replicate permanent 1-m” quadrats placed on top of boulders and bommies (Appendix
C) were established for the monitoring of the density of feeding individuals. Separate
bommies for the monitoring of tentacle insertion rates were selected in another patch
similar to the permanent plots. Daytime (07:00-08:00) behavioral observations were
done on eight sampling dates, which comprise four neap tide days (19-20 April and
4-5 May 2012) and four spring tide days (26-27 April and 9-10 May 2012) based on
the tidal calendar plotted from the tide prediction data (NAMRIA 2012). During each
sampling date, an entire dataset of behavioral observations, apparent population
densities and water quality parameter sampling was collected to represent each tide

phase, i.e. low, flood, high and ebb tides.


2. Behavioral observations, and estimation of the density of feeding population
and tentacle insertion rates

The morphology, microhabitat utilization and population density of Stolus
buccalis in the study area are known from previous studies (see Chapter 2 and 4).
Preliminary observations were used as bases for recognizing feeding (i.e. tentacles
fully extended and inserted one by one into the mouth) and visible, non-feeding
individuals (i.e. tentacles visible but contracted). Densities of feeding individuals
inside nine 1-m? permanent quadrats were recorded in situ during each circatidal
sampling of the eight sampling dates. Non-feeding individuals under rocky substrate
or embedded within its matrix, were not quantified, as the removal of sea cucumbers
and the resulting damage to their microhabitat would affect subsequent sampling
(each quadrat was surveyed a total of 30 times throughout the study). The mean
densities of feeders in all quadrats per sampling were used in the analyses.

Immediately after the direct counting of feeders, underwater cameras with
accessories for stabilization were set in place to capture videos of tentacular feeding
movements. A set of sampling included at least 6 haphazardly selected feeding
individuals were video-recorded for 30-s to 7-min. (mean 1.2 min.). Feeding rates per
individual were estimated by scoring the number of times one of the eight large
tentacles (LTIR) or two small tentacles (STIR) were inserted in the mouth within the
last 1-min. segment of each video. Total tentacle insertion rates (TIR=LTIR+STIR)
and LTIR: STIR ratios per individual were calculated. TIR was used in the statistical
analyses as proxy for feeding rate. Specific tentacular movements and other feeding-
related behaviors observed in sequence at various conditions in sifu and in the videos
were also defined and detailed in an ethogram. A total of 231 videos were analyzed,

with a mean of 10 (range 6-13) per circatidal sampling.


3. Determination of total suspended solids and flow speed

For the estimation of total suspended solids (TSS; mg I"), water samples (2 x
900 ml-1.5 I) were taken before and around the middle of the duration of each
behavioral sampling period from ~10 cm above a complex substrate near the
observation plots. Samples (0.5 1) were suction-filtered through pre-ignited and pre-
weighed 0.45 um Whatman membrane filters. Filters were rinsed twice with 50 ml
distilled water, oven-dried at 70 °C until constant weight and measured for dry weight
(DW) to derive the values for TSS (Villanueva et al. 2006). The mean TSS values per
sampling were used as a rough indicator of the concentration of particles likely
encountered by suspension-feeders.

Flow speed were recorded at 10-min. intervals during April monitoring periods
(two neap and two spring tide days) using a Nortek AS acoustic Doppler current
profiler (ADCP) moored ~2m above a bommie similar to but ~30 m away from
observation plots. Within the recorded current velocity profile, only the speed values
at the depth of the substrate during behavioral sampling were used in the analyses,

and interpreted as an indicator of the typical flow speed experienced by the animals.

4, Data analyses

Data on the density of feeders, TIR, TSS and flow speed were initially tested for
Pearson product-moment correlation. These data were then grouped by the tide cycle
(neap and spring), tide phase (low, flood, high and ebb), and time of day (moming,
noon and afternoon for 07:30-10:29, 10:30-13:29 and 13:30-18:00, respectively)
corresponding to their sampling period. Data on TIR and density of feeders were also
grouped by TSS and flow speeds. Considering the range of TSS values in this study,

as well as those previously reported (e.g. in Yap et al. 2004, San Diego-McGlone &


Ranches 2003) for the Bolinao area, TSS values were arbitrarily categorized as “low”
if <30 mg I" and “high” if >31 mg I”. Given that flow speeds measured at the site
had an overall mean of 5.1 +3.2 cm s“ (range 0.4~21.2 cm s“'; March 23 and 30, May
19, 20, 26 and 27, 2012), which approximates the reported values near the site (see
Gecek & Legovic 2010), flow speeds were arbitrarily categorized as “low” if <5.0 cm
sand “high” >5.1 cms“.

Datasets per factor groupings were tested for normality and homogeneity with
Shapiro-Wilks and Bartlett’s Test, respectively; data were log-transformed when p-
values indicate non-normality and/or non-homogeneity. One-way ANOVA was used
to test whether the behavioral variables (mean density of feeders and the TIR) varied
significantly with the environmental factors (TSS, flow speed, time of day, tide phase
and tide cycle). The null hypotheses are that no relationships exist between the
measures of feeding behavior and the environmental factors. One-way ANOVA was
also used to separately test whether the TSS and flow speed values (as dependent
variables) significantly differed with the tide cycle, tide phase and time of day
categories (as factors). Post-hoc Tukey’s HSD was performed for significant ANOVA.
results where appropriate. All statistical analyses were done in R 2.11.1 GUI 1.34 (R

Development Core Team 2010). All statistical analyses used 0.05 alpha level.

C. Results and discussions
1, Feeding behavior of Stolus buccalis

The ethogram of Stolus buccalis related to suspension feeding (Table 3.1 and
Fig. 3.2) consists of 13 movement sequences, 6 of which are directly involved in
tentacle insertions. The 8 large tentacles were primarily used in the capture of

suspended food particles by fully extending its stalk with numerous (~20) spirally


arranged branches into a cup-shaped meshwork that sways passively with the ambient
flow and entraps particles (Movement A1). At no point did the large tentacles search
for food by active swaying or sweeping, in contrast to those reported for Psolus
chitonoides (Fankboner 1978). Entrapped particles are ingested through a sequence of
tentacle branch contraction, stalk flexion and insertion into the mouth (Movement
A2-A3), similar to those described for Aslia lefevrii (Costelloe & Keegan 1984).
Only one tentacle is inserted at a time, as the peribuccal lip closes in synchrony when
a tentacle inserted. Before the large tentacle can completely withdraw (Movement
AA), the branches of the small tentacles usually press or pinch against those of the
large tentacles (Movement AS). This is followed by the insertion of the same small
tentacle (Movements A6—7), which often bears down on remaining particles from the
branches of the large tentacles, as also reported for A. /efevrii; although in the latter
the small tentacles are “randomly” inserted and perhaps not as closely coupled with
the large tentacle movements (Costelloe & Keegan 1984).

The two small, ventro-medial tentacles (~% the length of the other eight) have
only 4 less dendritic primary branches arranged in 2 pairs, with the proximal pair
longer and distinctly oriented towards the mouth. These tentacles seem to function in
particle handling and post-capture rejection. In 15 videos (6% of the samples),
discrete and deliberate movements were observed, suggesting the role of small
tentacles in actively removing large particles. Small tentacles can sweep the oral disk
(Movement A8), or pinch and flick large particles (Movement A9), or assist in the
removal of bolus-like mass of particles from the pharynx (Movement A10). Small
tentacles can also actively remove macroalgal fragments manually introduced, a

behavior earlier noted by Konnecker & Keegan (1973) for Neopentadactyla mixta.


The feeding densities ranged widely from 0 to 80 ind. m? per quadrat (mean 16
+17), or from 0.7 to 37.9 ind, m? (mean 16 +12) when summed across 9 quadrats.
Total insertion rates (TIR) varied between 7-23 insertions min”! (mean 15.6 +3.2). As
large and small tentacles insertions alternated, the LTIR: STIR ratios were close to
unity (mean 1.07 40.21), and the mean LTIR (8.0 +1.7) and STIR (7.6 +1.9) did not
differ significantly (Kruskal-Wallis p=0.07). Thus, further statistical analyses on
individual feeding used only the TIR. In comparison with studies on temperate
dendrochirotes (Table 3.2), S. buccalis had 2-10 times faster TIR. These differences
may represent interspecies variability, differences in study methods (Singh 1999)

and/or driven by metabolic rate related to much higher temperature in the tropics.

2. Response to particle concentration

Particle concentration in water column as measured in TSS (range 4.8-55 mg I"')
had strong positive correlation with the density of feeders (Pearson r=0.61, p<0.001)
and moderate positive correlation with TIR (r=0.44, p<0.001). The mean density of
feeders differed very significantly between low TSS (6.3 £6.7 ind. m) and high TSS
(21.5 +10.1 ind, m*) sampling periods (ANOVA p=0.0002; Fig. 3.3A1). Mean TIR
also differed very significantly between low TSS (14.4 min”) and high TSS (16.7
min) sampling periods (ANOVA p<0.001; Fig. 3.3B1). TSS appeared to be the
primary determinant for the changes in both feeding response measures.

Although the number of feeders is easier to observe and measure than TIR, the
latter is a more sensitive indicator given the smaller range of values and higher
statistical significance of mean differences (Fig. 3.3). This may be due in part to the
greater variance in the feeding density estimates because of differences in inter-

individual responses to environmental factors and other unaccounted variables, such


as satiation. Nevertheless the results indicate that positive responses to the increased
particle concentration are detectable at the population level through large proportions
of feeding animals, as well as at the individual level through small but significant
increases in TIR.

Our results on individual feeding activities varying with particle concentration are
comparable with Singh et al.’s (1999) observations on Cucumaria frondosa in the Bay
of Fundy, Canada. In their short-term, circatidal feeding observations, TIR
significantly increased with increasing TSS and chloropigment concentration, but not
with the percent organics while the percentage of feeding individuals increased with
chloropigment concentration and percent organics, but not with TSS (Singh et al.
1999). While the changes in TSS were strongly related to feeding behavior of Stolus
buccalis and perhaps a good proxy for food availability, future studies should

investigate their diet composition and the effects of phytoplankton concentration.

3. Response to flow speed

Near-bottom flow speeds ranged from 0.6 to 14 cm s”. TIR only had a weak
positive correlation with flow speed (1=0.29, p=0.002), but mean TIR differed very
significantly between low (14.7 42.8 min”) and high flow speeds (16.5 £3.2 min;
p=0.0027). On the other hand, densities of feeders were not correlated with flow
speed (=0.09, p=0.31) and did not differ significantly between low and high speeds.
Thus, flow speeds appear to have a positive effect on individual feeding rates but this
was not apparent at the population level. The study on Cucumaria frondosa in
Passamaquoddy Bay, Canada (Holtz & MacDonald 2009) demonstrated that feeding

rates were positively influenced by flow speeds up to 60 cm s, Future studies in

SZ

areas with greater flow speed ranges, or in flume experiments in the laboratory are
required to elucidate its relationship with feeding measures.

Flow speed is a critical factor in the delivery of food particles to passive
suspension feeders and in the efficiency of the feeding apparatus to capture and retain
particles (Shimeta & Jumars 1991). The results of this study, however, indicate that
TSS was neither correlated (r=0.06, p=0.86) nor differed significantly with flow
speeds (p=0.773). Flow speed may have a complex relation with TSS in the field,
which may confound correlation. The potential effects of different directional flows
(e.g. with the changing tides), dynamics in shallow waters (e.g. sediment

resuspension) and other factors should be investigated.

4. Response to tidal, temporal and related environmental factors

Both the number of feeding individuals and TIR were significantly higher during
the spring (20.9 ind. m® and 16.3 min") than the neap tide (11.1 ind. m® and 15.2
min”; Figs. 3.3A3 and B3). The ranges and means of both TSS and flow speed did
not differ significantly though they were higher in the spring than neap cycle. Perhaps
other factors that could affect the quality of suspended food particles differed with the
tide cycles (such as phytoplankton concentration).

The tide phases had no significant effect on the number of feeding individuals

(p=0.86), although it had very significant effects on the TIR. TIR was significantly

higher at high tide (mean 16.9 min”) than both flood tide (15.1 min”; p-adj=0.004),
and ebb tide (15.2 min”; p-adj.=0.01; Fig. 3.3B3). However, there were no significant
differences in TSS (p=0.16) and flow speed (p=0.08) with respect to tide phases.
These results are contrary to the assumption that the flow between the channel and the

sea driven by the tides would result in more predictable changes or even tight


coupling in TSS, flow speed and the tide phases. In particular, it was assumed that the
ebb would deliver greater concentration of suspended particles from the nutrient-
enriched channel. However, near-bottom TSS pattems with the tides may be
confounded by sediment resuspension in water column (Rivera 1997).

The number of feeders differed significantly with time of the day; in particular,

more animals fed in the afternoon than in the moming (22.5 vs. 8.3 m®; Tukey’s HSD

p-adj=0.007; Fig, 3.3A2). TIR was also significantly higher at noon than afternoon
(16.8 vs. 15.3 min; Tukey’s HSD p-adj.=0.002; Fig. 3.3B2). This short-term
temporal change in densities and TIR appear to be independent from the effects TSS
and flow speed, as neither factors differed significantly with the time of day (p=0.16
and 0.4, respectively). Unfortunately, the study design is inadequate to separate the
effects of the time of day and tide phases given that during the study the flood and ebb
tides were more predominant in the morning and afternoon, respectively.

The potential influence of the time of day to behavior is also difficult to interpret
without considering temperature, light and other environmental factors. There were
small yet significant differences in temperature among morning, noon and afternoon
observations (mean 31.3, 31.5 and 32 °C, respectively; Kruskal-Wallis p<0.0001).
However, temperature was neither correlated with densities (Pearson r=0.02, p=0.94)
nor TIR of Stolus buccalis (r=-0.11, p=0.27). In both short- and long-term field
studies on Cucumaria frondosa, temperature also had no significant influence on
feeding rates and the number of feeders (Hamel & Mercier 1998, Singh et al. 1999).

Photoperiod and light intensity are known to modulate the feeding, hiding and
other behaviors of many sea cucumber species (Stier 1933, Clouse 1997, Singh et al.
1999, Mercier & Hamel 2009, Purcell 2010), although their photosensory

mechanisms are unknown. Given the increase in feeding densities from morning to


aftemoon, it would be interesting to investigate if S. buccalis has nocturnal or
crepuscular periodicity, which is common among sea cucumbers and assumed to be
an adaptation to reduce predation risk (e.g. Holothuria difficilis in Bakus 1968; H.

scabra juvenile in Dance et al. 2003).

D. Summary and conclusions

To our knowledge, there is no published information on the feeding ecology of
tropical dendrochirote species. The use of continuous video recordings and in situ
observations provided an ethogram and quantitative description of the feeding and
emergence pattems of Stolus buccalis, which may serve as foundation for subsequent
studies on the feeding behavior and ecology of tropical dendrochirotes. In comparison
with previously studied temperate dendrochirotes (Table 3.2), S. buccalis had much
faster tentacle movements, especially the two ventromedial tentacles. We hypothesize
that the small tentacles in S. buccalis have specialized functions in (1) particle
handling by routinely scooping the unreleased particles from the large tentacles into
the mouth, and (2) also in particle selectivity through active rejection of unsuitably
large or non-nutritive particles. Field studies in areas/periods with wide TSS
fluctuations, or manipulating suspended particles (types, sizes and concentrations) in
controlled laboratory setup may elucidate functional responses of the tentacles.

Overall, this study suggests that changes in the proportion of feeding individuals,
feeding rates and other feeding movements (e.g. post-capture particle rejection) are
responses to changes in suspended particle concentration. Results also suggest that
better density estimates may be acquired when monitoring is done between 13:30 to

18:00, although the proximate cue and adaptive value for the animals remain


unknown. The effects of tidal factors and flow speed on behavior were less evident,
and may be better understood by studying populations in other sites and seasons.
Stolus buccalis was first recorded during the reef-wide survey in 2009 and is
among the most numerous sea cucumber species in Bolinao (Olavides etal. 2010;
Chapter 2). The taxonomic survey by Reyes-Leonardo et al. (1985) conducted three
decades ago recorded numerous species near the study site, including Actinocucumis
typica and Cladolabes schmeltzii, but not S. buccalis which probably was not
numerous enough to be easily detected. In the intervening years, excessive nutrient
and TSS levels (San Diego-McGlone & Ranches 2003), shifts in phytoplankton
composition (Azanza et al. 2006), sedimentation, and the degradation of corals

(Villanueva et al. 2006), all mainly attributed to the poorly regulated fish farming

activities since the late 1990’s (Verceles et al. 2000), resulted to changes in benthic
community structure and ambient seawater conditions. The dense population of S.
buccalis in the nutrient-enriched Tomasa Point and its absence elsewhere in Bolinao
(Olavides et al. 2010), taken together, suggest that the area provides favorable
conditions for this species. With the abundance of this suspension-feeder, its potential
to consume excess organic wastes should be considered in future studies, perhaps in

comparison with Cucumaria frondosa, which is very efficient in extracting

aquaculture-derived organic particles (Nelson et al. 2012).

CHAPTER 4
Preliminary studies on the taxonomy of dendrochirote species

(order Dendrochirotida Grube 1840) in Bolinao, Philippines


Abstract

Dendrochirotes (Dendrochirotida: Holothuroidea) occur in dense multi-species
aggregations within restricted areas in the shallow, rocky reefs of Bolinao. Their
morphology, anatomy and ossicles were described to determine their species names,
which are important for the ecological studies conducted in the area, and document
their morphological variations. Taxonomic accounts were provided for five nominal
species identified as Actinocucumis cf. longipedes, Plesiocolochirus sp. 1,
Afrocucumis africana (Semper 1867), Cladolabes schmelizii (Ludwig 1875), and
Stolus buccalis (Stimpson 1855). Based on combinations of differences in body color,
cross-section and rigidity, podia size and distribution, tentacle color and arrangement,
and calcareous ring and ossicle morphology, eight additional morphological variants
within Actinocucumis (4), Plesiocolochirus (2) and Stolus (2) were distinguished for
further studies testing possible synonymies or cryptic speciation through integrative
taxonomic approach. Reviews on the morphological characters documented in
original species descriptions and their synonyms, and nomenclatural changes
highlight the need to resolve systematic uncertainties with the re-examination of type

specimens and molecular phylogenetic studies of the relevant genera.


A. Introduction

Tropical dendrochirote species (order Dendrochirotida Grube 1840) are difficult
to identify given that modern taxonomic keys and photographic guides are scarce, and
that most species descriptions are over a century to several decades old with meager
details and often not written in English. Diverse ossicle morphology, drastic reaction
to fixation (McKenzie 1991), restricted distribution (James 1984) and the difficulty in
obtaining adequate or intact specimens are intrinsic factors that may have slowed the
refinement and clarification of the taxonomy of many dendrochirote species. With the
inadequate knowledge on many species, the accuracy of the currently held
synonymies and systematic positions are doubtful.

Semper (1868), who first systematically investigated the diverse sea cucumber
fauna of the Philippine archipelago, recognized 46 species and varietal names with
Philippine type localities (mostly Bohol), 38 of which remain accepted names (Samyn
et al. 2013). Semper found 18 dendrochirote species, of which, only Colochirus
quadrangularis (Troschel 1846; =Colochirus coeruleus Semper 1867), was
subsequently recorded again in the archipelago (Reyes-Leonardo 1984; in Sorsogon).
Sluiter (1901) found Cladolabes schmelizii (Ludwig 1875) in Tawi-Tawi, the first
Philippine record; this species was also later found in Bolinao (Reyes-Leonardo
1984). Domantay added a new record for Cladolabes aciculus (Semper 1867), and
described a new species, Cladolabes roxasi (Domantay 1934), both from Puerto
Galera. Domantay (1962) also described the subspecies Thyone buccalis lourdesae
from the Hundred Islands (Alaminos), which was later synonymized with Stolus
buccalis (Stimpson 1855) by James (1966). Cherbonnier and Féral (1981) added new
records for Staurocucumis nocturna (Sluiter 1901) and Ypsilothuria bitentaculata

(Ludwig 1893), and described Phyllophorella roseus. Reyes-Leonardo (1984)


provided the first record of Actinocucumis typicus in Bolinao. Through these
taxonomic and faunistic works, the order Dendrochirotida is well represented by at
least 27 species in the Philippines (see Appendix D).

- Recently, a sea cucumber resource assessment of the Bolinao-Anda reef system
determined the location of a mixed species aggregation of dendrochirotes (Olavides et
al. 2010) that provide opportunities for ecological (see Chapter 2) and taxonomic
studies. The objective of this study is to provide systematic accounts of the common
dendrochirote species found in Bolinao based on morphological, anatomical and
ossicle examinations. Preliminary assessments of the reliability of morphological
traits, and reviews on the status of species and genera are provided to help clarify of
their taxonomy and guide future studies on related species using a more integrative

approach,

B. Materials and methods

Search for dendrochirotes species were done in the subtidal coastal areas of
Bolinao, Philippines. Dendrochirotes were only found at four sites (Fig. 4.1) located
along the southeastern coast of Santiago Is. (Tomasa Point, Bungao and Lucero) and
the northernmost tip of Cape Bolinao (Trinchera Point). Specimens were collected by
scuba diving in the rocky nearshore areas of sites at 2-5 m depths.

In the laboratory, specimens were anaesthetized in 7.5% MgCl, solution for at
least two hours before preservation in 75% ethanol. Preserved specimens were placed
in small vials with 95% ethanol and provisionally coded using the first three letters of
their genus name and a number sequence for each genus (for eventual storage in the
invertebrate collections of the Marine Science Institute). At least five specimens per

species were photographed and examined under a stereomicroscope (Swift Stereo


Zoom) to describe their color, gross morphology, tentacles, podia and other external
characters (see complete list in Appendix E). Specimens were dissected by making a
longitudinal incision along their ventral mid-line to observe, describe, photograph and
digitally measure their calcareous ring, retractor muscles, longitudinal muscles, Polian
vesicles, stone canals, respiratory trees, gonad and other internal structures.

Tissue samples from extemal body regions commonly used in systematic
classification of dendrochirotes, particularly the body wall (dorsal, ventral and peri-
anal), podia (dorsal and ventral), tentacles and introvert were collected for
examination of their ossicle assemblages (see matrix in Appendix F). Tissues were
also taken from the retractor muscles, longitudinal muscles, cloaca, digestive tract,
respiratory trees, intestines and gonad to document presence of ossicles. Each tissue
sample was placed in a microwell and treated with 10% NaClO for 20 min. Ossicles
examined and photographed under a compound microscope (Zeis Axiovert), digitally
measured (>100 per species) and illustrated. For each ossicle type (see descriptions in
Appendix G), the length and width or diameter (in pm) of individual ossicles were
measured, and the number of perforations recorded.

Tissue samples and photographs of live specimens of morphospecies were
sent to Gustav Paulay and Francois Michonneau (University of Florida) for CO1
sequencing and comparison with their database (see CO! sequences in Appendix H).
Old descriptions not in English were translated with the help of Google Translate
(https://translate google.com; examples in Appendix 1). Morphological descriptions
were compared with original descriptions and subsequent taxonomic accounts of

species, synonyms and congenerics.


C. Taxonomic accounts

Order Dendrochirotida Grube 1840

Family Cucumariidae Ludwig 1894

1. Actinocucumis Ludwig 1875

Remarks: Heding & Panning (1954) listed five junior synonyms of Actinocucumis
typica Ludwig 1875. They suggested that the ossicles in Actinocucumis difficilis Bell
1884, Pseudocucumis quinquangularis Sluiter 1901, Phyllophorus simplex Sluiter
1914, Phyllophorus cornus Heding 1934, and A. longipedes Clark 1938 were identical
to those in typica. They argued that (1) the variations in fenestrated ellipsoids (i.e.
“figure-eight”, “acorns” and “semi-spherical”) represent a continuum of development
stages which include the tables, and (2) neither the “pear-shaped” tables nor minute
plates are exclusive to /ongipedes, contrary to Clark’s (1938) suggestion, Heding and
Panning further considered the descriptions of the five nominal Actinocucumis species
unreliable, but did not re-examine the types. O’Loughlin et al. (2014) recently
provided a sensu stricto diagnosis of typica based on Australian specimens with
morphological characters that fit Ludwig’s original description, and raised the five
names out of synonymy from fypica. Hence the genus now requires a comprehensive

review using the type materials of these nominal species.

Actinocucumis cf. longipedes Clark 1938. Figures 4.2A-H, 4.3A-I and 4.4A-E

Materials examined. Two specimens in detail: ACTOOl (47 x 9 mm,
Trinchera Point, 17 November 2012) and ACTOS3 (42.5 x 9 mm, 1.6 g, Trinchera
Point, 8 August 2014); 16 specimens for size range and external morphology
(ACTOS1, ACT0S2 and ACTOS4-ACTO67; Trinchera Point, 8 August 2014); 2

specimens for CO1 sequence (PH003 and PH032, 3 September 2011).


Description. External morphology. Body slender, elongated, 18-66 mm.
(mean 31 mm) long, 3-15 mm (mean 7 mm) wide at mid-body in life (shrinkage in
ethanol minimal), tapered at both ends, pentangular in cross section (Fig. 4.2G). Body
wall moderately rigid and thin (0.2-0.4 mm). Body color ranges from dark reddish
brown (ACT053~056) to purplish brown to very dark purplish grey in life; fades
slightly under preservation, turning ethanol dirty brown or purplish. Podia similar in
color to body; cylindrical, firm, highly extendable but not fully retractable; length
ranges from relatively short to very long (0.3-3 mm when contracted; up to 7 mm
when extended); arranged in paired 2 (typical) to 4 rows per radius; dorsally medium—
long (0.8-3 mm in ACTOS3) podia irregularly alternate with smaller (0.5-0.7 mm)
podia; ventrally, podia mostly large (1.7-3.3 mm), some medium-sized (0.8-1.3 mm).
Introvert short (1.5-3 mm), dark brown to black. Tentacles 20, dendritic, all of similar
size (~3 when contracted, up to 11 mm when fully extended), arranged in one ring
(Fig. 4.2F), dark brown (almost black) to black. Mouth and anus terminal.

Internal anatomy (ACTOS3, 42.5 mm x 9 mm). Calcareous ring not
composite, without posterior projections (Fig. 4.2E). Radial and interradial plates
fused at basal ends, both with incurved posterior margins. Radial plates 2.2 mm high,
with broad anterior margin (1.5 mm) medially notched for the attachment of retractor
muscles. Interradial plates 2 mm high, with pointy anterior end (0.05 mm), thin
midsection (0.6 mm). Buccal retractor muscles 0.4-0.5 mm wide, ~15 mm long (1/3
of body length). Longitudinal muscles 0.4-0.5 mm wide. Polian vesicle single, long
(5-7 mm), flask-shaped. Stone canal single, 1.5 mm long, arising from the dorsal
right side of the ring canal extending freely into body cavity; madreporite
inconspicuous or missing. Digestive tract relatively short (~25 mm), yellowish.

Gonad in two tufts, one on each side of the dorsal mesentery; gonad tubules well-


developed (6-10 mm long, 3-1 mm in diameter), branched twice, yellow; eggs
macroscopic (~350 jm in diameter), yellow. Respiratory tree with two short stalks
arising independently reaching a fourth of body length (~10 mm long), well-branched,
pinkish. Cloaca 7 mm long, pinkish; cloacal dilator muscles very fine, long (up to 4.5
mm).

Ossicles (ACTOO1, 47 mm x 9 mm). Dorsal and ventral body wall with
numerous fenestrated ellipsoids (height 35-45 um, mean 40 um; Fig. 4.3B), and few
minute plates (height 27-41 xm, mean 33 ym; Fig. 4.3A). Ellipsoids at their broadest,
most stable face are “figure-eight” shaped with a central node from which an X-
shaped structure arises, which are closed by arches; in tilted views, the X-shaped
structure is not flat (Figs. 4.4A—B), the central node is a crossbar and the arches
appear like nodes. Minute plates with two elongated lateral and 2-4 smaller, circular
apical holes. Dorsal and ventral mid-body podia with ellipsoids (height 35-60 pm,
mean 42 pm), minute plates (height 32-53 im, mean 42 pm), large support plates
(width 43-208 um, mean 119 ym; Fig. 4.3F), large endplates (width 318-385 um,
mean 343 um; Fig. 4.3E), and tables (Figs. 4.3C-D, 4.4D-E). Large support plates
thick, with 4-12 holes (mean 9), diverse in form and often with 1-3 handle-like
projections. Tables highly modified, of diverse size and form, either with conical or
truncated spire, with or without two basal extensions; some converging in form on
ellipsoids (Figs. 4.4A-E). Tables that lack basal extensions are 27-50 rm wide (mean
39 pm), 36-79 pm high (mean 49 um) and have conical spires formed from four
pillars, joined by a crossbar, merging to a single (rarely two) terminal node. Tables
with one or two rod-like basal disk extension are 99-230 um wide (mean 156 pm),
31-56 um high (mean 44 1m), with conical or truncated spire; those with truncated

spire typically >160 ym wide; basal extensions either relatively straight or curved


downwards at variable angles. Tentacles and introvert with numerous small to
medium-sized perforated rods (37-210 rm, mean 94 um; Fig, 4.3G), large rods (253—
478 um, mean 329 pm), and small tables (51-121 ym, mean 77 um). Perforated rods
may be straight or curved; small to medium-sized rods with 2-8 terminal perforations;
large rods with 7-16 terminal perforations. Small tables with two pillars, usually bifid
spire, and oval to elongated basal disk with 8-30 holes. Ossicles absent in the
intestines, and respiratory trees.

Remarks. Prior to O’Loughlin et al.’s (2014) sensu stricto diagnosis of typica
and their decision on its synonymies, Actinocucumis comprised of only chinensis,
donnani and typica (Paulay 2013). Thus specimens from Bolinao collected in 2011-
2012 were initially identified as typica and were considered to be its second record for
the Philippines, after Reyes-Leonardo (1984, also from Bolinao) based on similarities
with A. typica sensu lato. Loughlin et al. did not consider Reyes-Leonardo’s record
as typica due to their description of “wart-like podia scattered all over the body” and
the ossicle similarities with A. longipedes. Given the brevity of Reyes-Leonardo’s
description, her four Actinocucumis specimens (MSIEC030) deposited in the
Invertebrate Museum of the Marine Science Institute (University of the Philippines)
need to be re-examined to determine their identity. The present Bolinao specimens
described above differ from A. typica sensu stricto in body color, relative lengths of
podia and tentacles, the more elongated basal extension in tables and the presence of
minute plates. They most closely resemble A. /ongipedes (summarized in Table 4.1),
which is currently only known with certainty from its type locality Broome, NW

Australia.

‘Actinocucumis cf. longipedes is only one of the five forms of Actinocucumis in

Bolinao (Figs. 4.5A-D) that subjectively differ in a combination of traits (e.g. podia


size and distribution, body color and ossicle variations). This morphospecies co-
occurs in dense aggregations with other the forms in the shallow-water (2-5 m) rocky
areas of Trinchera Point and the westem side of Santiago Island and are difficult to
distinguish apart in situ. Only two small Actinocucumis specimens, PH003 (18 mm x
2.5 mm) and PH032 (25 mm x 3 mm), have been genetically sequenced and their
sequences differ from four other unidentified Actinocucumis specimens from
Queensland (Australia), suggesting the possibility of a species complex (Gustav

Paulay, pers. comm.).

2, Plesiocolochirus Cherbonnier 1946
Remarks: Plesiocolochirus was erected based only on spinosus (Quoy & Gaimard
1833) but now accommodates eight others, namely armatus (Marenzeller 1881),
australis (Ludwig 1875), challengeri (Théel 1888), dispar (Lampert 1889), ignavus
(Ludwig 1875), inornatus (Marenzeller 1881), occiduus (O'Loughlin & O'Hara 1992)
and tesselarus (Cherbonnier 1970) (Paulay 2015). Uncertainties remain in the current
species assignment in Plesiocolochirus (O’ Loughlin & Alcock 2000, Thandar 2006).
Cherbonnier (1952, 1970, 1984, 1988) considered australis, dispar and tesselarus to
belong to Pentacta, but Rowe’s diagnoses (Rowe & Gates 1995 in Thandar 2006)
influenced their current placement. The morphological characters of most
Plesiocolochirus species differ most noticeably from spinosus in their podia
distribution, absence of lateral spines, and absence of posterior projections in their
calcareous rings (Table 4.2). These issues may only be resolved with systematic

reviews and molecular phylogenetic studies on Plesiocolochirus, Pentacta and related

genera.


Plesiocolochirus sp. 1. Figures 4.6A—J and 4.8A-I

Materials examined. Two specimens in detail: PLEO11 (11 mm x 3.3 mm)
and PLEO13 (19 mm x 4 mm); 4 specimens for size range and external morphology
(PLE008, PLE009, PLEO10, and PLEO12). All specimens collected among dead
corals at 1-1.5 m depth in Tomasa Point, Bolinao (10 May 2012).

Description. External anatomy. Body slender, elongated, 9-19 mm long
(mean 13 mm), 3—4.5 mm wide (mean 3.4 mm) in life; shrinkage in ethanol minimal;
gently tapered at both ends. Body cross-section roughly quadrangular, with either
inward (Fig. 4.61) or outward arching of dorsal interradius; under preservation, dorsal
interradius tends to be concave and radii may develop sharp ridges (Fig. 4.6C). Body
wall rigid and thick (0.25-0.7 mm, mean 0.45 mm) with granular surface texture;
preserved specimens become brittle after prolonged exposure to air. Dorsal and lateral
surfaces from greyish to purplish grey overall or reddish brown with darker greyish
blotches; reddish color dissolves in ethanol and specimens tum greyish or greyish-
brown with more visible dark blotches (diameter 0.2-0.5 mm; Fig. 4.6C). Ventral
surfaces smoother than dorsal, bright orange (Fig. 4.6B); orange color dissolves in
ethanol, tuning ventral surface white or dirty white.

Minute wart-like protrusions (diameter 0.06-0.13 mm, mean 0.1 mm)
throughout the body, concentrated in dorsal and ventro-lateral radii, scattered and
sparse interradially (Fig. 4.61). Dorsal podia small (diameter 0.12-0.2 mm, mean 0.16
mm), stalk length up to 0.3 mm, arising from the center of low mounds (mean

diameter 0.4 mm, mean height 1.4 mm), restricted radially in two irregular zigzag

rows. Ventral podia large (diameter 0.23-0.36 mm, mean 0.28 mm), long (0.5-2.5

mm, mean 1 mm), soft and highly extendible stalk, arranged in two zigzag rows per


radius; smaller podia (diameter >0.2 mm) irregularly interspersed between large ones,
not forming rows.

Oral end with a distinct collar (length 1-2 mm, mean 1.5 mm) that forms five
triangular valves that cover retracted tentacles and support tentacles when extended;
collar stiff with thicker integument, scalloped margin, minute radial podia, dark grey
to almost black (more distinct against ventral surface). Introvert relatively short (0.4—
1 mm), lacking podia. Tentacles 10, dendritic, arranged in one ring (Fig. 4.6G); eight
long tentacles (1-2 mm when contracted; 2-8 mm or 1/3 of body length when fully
extended) with 8-12 primary branches; two short ventro-medial tentacles (about half
the length of the others) with four primary branches. Color of introvert and tentacle
stalks pale yellow with dark brown speckles; tentacle branches with additional orange
patches; dark brown broken lines surround the mouth. Mouth terminal, slightly
upturned. Anus sub-dorsal, with five very small, light brown anal teeth.

Internal anatomy (PLEO11, 11 mm x 3.3 mm, and PLE013, 19 mm x 4 mm).
Calcareous ring not composite (Fig. 4.6H). Radial plates 0.9-1 mm high, 0.35-0.4
mm wide, with tapered and bisected anterior margin, shallow posterior notch; short
(0.1 mm) posterior projection either present (in PLEO11; Fig. 4.6H1) or absent (in
PLEO13; Fig. 4.6H2). Interradial plates 0.65-0.7 mm high, 0.4-0.5 mm wide, with
pointed arrowhead-shaped anterior margin and deeply indented posterior margin (0.1~
0.25 mm deep). Buccal retractor muscles 0.2-0.3 mm wide, ~3 mm long (~1/4 the
body length in specimens with everted introvert). Longitudinal muscles 0.2-0.3 mm
wide. Polian vesicle unpigmented, single, long (2-4 mm) and tubular but narrowing to
a point. Stone canal single, short, convoluted; madreporite not observed. Gonad large,
greyish-orange, with unbranched tubules; eggs not observed. Respiratory tree greyish

pink, with two long main stalks arising independently from cloaca, reaching half of


body length. Digestive tract greyish yellow, at least twice the body length (~30 mm in
PLE011). Cloaca greyish yellow, 2~3 mm long; cloacal retractor muscles up to 1 mm
long, very fine.

Ossicles. Dorsal and ventral body wall with numerous baskets and scales.
Scales thick and very nodulous, variable in size and form, from small to moderate-
sized three-dimensional “buttons” (diameter 62-102 um, mean 81 um; Fig. 4.8A) to
large, ovoid masses (diameter 124-356 um, mean 243 um; Fig. 4.8B) with complex
networks of nodes. Baskets small to moderate-sized (height 46-110 um, mean 68 ym;
Fig. 4.8C), shallow convex, all lacking basal cross-bridge; in their basic, most
abundant form, ~56 ym high and ~44 ym wide, sub-rectangular, more or less
symmetrical in design, consisting of a cross-shaped branched rod forming four
primary holes (two large, two smaller, 19 and 12 jum in mean diameter, respectively),
four marginal holes (mean diameter 6 ym); nodes prominent (diameter 4.9-8.2 ym,
mean 6 pm), usually restricted to branching points, sometimes with pointy ends
especially at the basket’s rim (at slightly tilted views). Basket variations include
overall thickening and additional sets of marginal holes. Ventral, mid-body podia
with numerous baskets and irregular plates, few rod-plates, and a large circular
endplate (diameter 245-255 um, mean 251 jm; Fig. 4.8F). Irregular plates (height
94-139 xm, mean 130 um; Fig, 4.8D) nodulous, possess the basic design of baskets
but are larger, flatter and always asymmetrical. Rod-plates (length 127-220 pm, mean
181 um; Fig. 4.8E) with medial widening, two distal projections and variable number
of holes. Tentacles with numerous rosettes, perforated rods and rod-plates. Rosettes
small to large (diameter 15-96 1m, mean 42 jm), with smooth terminal branches,
rarely overlapping with each other, relatively thin and flat in lateral view (Fig. 4.8G).

Rods of two forms, small-thin (length 55-183 pm, mean 107 wm; Fig. 4.8H) and


large-thick (length 195-345 um, mean 277 pm; Fig. 4.81). Rod-plates (length 78-334
um, mean 185 ym) with more pronounced medial widening and up to three distal
projections. Ossicles absent in the intestines, gonad and respiratory trees.

Remarks: The combination of morphological characters of Plesiocolochirus
sp. 1 (hereinafter, sp. 1) that appear to distinguish it from other Plesiocolochirus is its
(1) orange podia and ventral surface (Figs. 4.6A—B and J), (2) calcareous ring with
short posterior radial extensions (Fig. 4.6H-2), (3) shallow convex basket ossicles
without a cross-bridge (Fig. 4.8C), and (4) relatively flat rosettes with regular
terminal branching (Fig. 4.8G; Table 4.2). Plesiocolochirus australis (Ludwig 1875;
NW Australia) and sp. 1 are similar in body shape, size, texture and rigidity, tentacle
color, and ossicle assemblage; thus sp. 1 was initially thought to represent australis.
However, australis does not have the orange coloration, and its baskets are deeply
convex and with cross-bridge (Ludwig 1875). Although Ludwig did not describe the
tentacle ossicles, Massin’s specimens (1999; Indonesia) that agree well with the
original description have rosettes that are frizzier and have more overlapping branches
than those found in sp. 1.

The original description of Plesiocolochirus dispar (Lampert 1889) and
Pentacta trimorpha (Clark 1921; NW Australia), which is a junior synonym of the
former (Rowe & Gates 1995 in Thandar 2006), provide the closest comparisons with
sp. 1. Aside from the shallow baskets lacking cross-bridge, they share in common
with sp. 1 the rigid quadrangular body, the presence of dorsal warts, and the two rows
of ventral podia, However, sp. 1 differs from dispar and its synonyms in its
reddish/orange coloration, although such is quickly lost in alcohol. Plesiocolochirus
dispar also has much larger scales (up to ~2 mm in Lampert 1889 and Ekman 1918,

~1 mm in all other records), and smaller, frizzier rosettes (<35 ym in Cherbonnier


1988 and Thandar 2006). In addition, the 19-mm sp. 1 specimen has radial plate
extensions that are lacking in all dispar accounts, regardless of their body size. Thus,
while sp. 1 is most similar to dispar, the combination of differences warrant further
comparisons with the syntypes, which Thandar (2006) suggested might be in
Stuttgart, Germany.

Plesiocolochirus sp. 1 is less abundant compared to two other unidentified
Plesiocolochirus species (Figs. 4.7A—D) that have less rigid body wall and basket
ossicles with cross-bridge. Plesiocolochirus sp. 1 is found in Tomasa Point, Bolinao
while the other two in both Tomasa Point and Trinchera Point, Bolinao. These
Plesiocolochirus species are found in suspension-feeding aggregations along with
Actinocucumis spp. and Cladolabes schmeltzii on the sides and understories of dead
corals, and on the stalks of macroalgae Caulerpa spp. and Halimeda spp. at 1-3 m

depths.

Materials examined. Two specimens in detail: AFROO1 (20.9 mm x 2.2 mm,
Trinchera Point, 3 m depth, undersurface of dead corals, 17 November 2012),
AFRO02 (13.5 mm x 3 mm, taken with AFROO1) and AFROO3 (22.6 mm x 6 mm live,
16 mm x 4 mm preserved; Lucero Sargassum bed, 3 m depth, 19 April 2013); 7
specimens for size range and external morphology (AFROO4-AFRO10; Trinchera
Point, 3-5 m depth, undersurface and crevices of dead corals, 8 August 2014); 2
specimens for CO1 sequence: (PH004 and PH00S; Tomasa Point, covered with fine
layer of silt under dead coral, 2 m depth, 2 September 2011).

Description. External morphology. Body slender, elongated, 4-30 mm long
(mean 17 mm), 2-9.3 mm wide at mid-body (mean 5.4 mm) in life; shrinkage in
ethanol substantial (up to ~25% difference); tapered at both ends, subcylindrical cross
section (Fig. 4.9D), little differentiation between venter and dorsum. Fission products

common (specimens PH005, AFR007, AFRO08, AFR009, AFRO10). Body wall thin


(0.10.2 mm), relatively soft (easily deformed when pressed) and with fine wrinkles
all over. Body color in life ranges from dark brown, brown with orange tinge, grey of
varying shades to purple; in alcohol usually from dark brown, dark grey to black but
can turn yellowish brown or off-white under prolonged preservation.

Dorsal and ventral podia similar in size, arranged in two irregularly paired
rows per radius; 16-28 pairs per radius depending on specimen length. Podia stalks
similar to body in color, soft, highly extendable and retractable; mean length 1.3 mm
(0.6-2.5 mm) when extended and 0.3 mm (0.2-0.5 mm) when contracted. Podia disks
black, prominent, mean diameter 0.3 mm (0.1-0.7 mm).

Tentacles 20, dendritic, in 2 rings (15+5; Fig. 4.9E); outer ring with 10 large
tentacles distributed in pairs interradially and 5 medium-sized tentacles radially-
aligned; inner ring with 5 small tentacles also radially-aligned. Tentacles with dark
grey to black stalks and black branches. Mouth and anus terminal. Anus with black
ring-like margin (0.15-0.2 mm wide) from which five blackish rudimentary anal teeth
(0.1-0.15 mm long) arise.

Internal anatomy (AFRO03, 22.6 mm x 6 mm): Plates of calcareous ring not
composite (Fig, 4.9F). Radial plates 1 mm high, 0.35~0.45 mm wide, subrectangular,
with anterior median notch (0.2 mm deep), and two posterior extensions (0.4-0.5 mm
long; 0.15 mm wide at attachment, tapering posteriorly to 0.05 mm) with the second
segment of the posterior extension bent inwards. Interradial plates 0.8 mm high, 0.35—
0.47 mm wide at posterior comers tapering anteriorly to an arrowhead shape. Buccal
retractor muscles 0.15-0.2 mm wide, ~5 mm long, attached about a fourth of the body
length from anterior end. Longitudinal muscles 0.15 mm wide, Polian vesicle single,
brown, ~1.5 mm long and tubular (diameter 0.2 mm). Stone canal single, brown, ~1

mm long, straight, attached to the dorsal mesentery, ending in a small spherical


madreporite (~0.8 mm diameter). Respiratory trees pinkish, with two main stalks
(~7.5 mm long) arising independently from the cloaca, reaching about half of body
length; with few, short branches. Digestive tract ~25 mm long with 0.3-0.6 mm wide
esophagus, 0.8-1.25 mm wide intestine, filled with sand particles, sponge spicules
and diatoms. Gonad not observed. Cloaca black.

Ossicles. Dorsal and ventral body wall with numerous lenticular plates, and
few nodulous plates that are precursors of the former. Lenticular plates large, circular,
(diameter 229-354 jm, mean 287 um; Figs. 4.10B-C), ~50 jm thick, with 20-50
large pyramidal nodes regularly alternating with equally numerous circular
perforations. Smaller nodulous plates (diameter 165-188 jm, mean 179 ym; Fig.
4.10A) with 8-20 less prominent nodes and larger perforations. Dorsal and ventral
mid-body podia with numerous rods and support plates, rare miliary granules (24-48
pm, mean 39 pm; Fig. 4.101), and a large endplate (171-302 pm, mean 237 pm; Fig.
4.10F). Rods long (121-251 pm, mean 189 pm; Fig, 4.10), thick, usually bent near
their distally dilated, perforated and spiny ends. Support plates elongated (88-249
hum, mean 148 um; Fig. 4.10H), with 4 large central holes and numerous smaller
holes. Tentacles and introvert with numerous rods; more slender than those in the
podia and with more prominent distal widening. Rods in small (34-144 um, mean 85
um) and large forms (175-210 ym, mean 189 um; Fig. 4.10G). Ossicles absent in the
intestines, respiratory trees and retractor muscles.

Remarks: This study provides the first Philippine record of Afrocucumis
africana. The specimens described above accord well with Semper’s (1867) brief
description of Cucumaria africana, Ludwig’s (1888) re-examination of the syntypes,
and Massin’s (1999) detailed account of A. africana except in the presence of miliary

granules in the podia, which has only been reported for A. stracki Massin 1996 and


Orcula cucumiformis Semper 1867 (see also Lampert 1896). Afrocucumis stracki,
currently only known from its type locality (Indonesia), is very similar to A. africana
in morphology (Massin 1996) but the two species are genetically distinct (Gustav
Paulay, pers. comm.).

The CO1 sequences of specimens PH004 (dark brown; Fig. 4.9A1) and
PHO00S (blackish; Fig. 4.942) matches with those identified as A. africana from
Kosrae, Majuro and Réunion but distinct from those from Papua New Guinea,
Okinawa, Eparses and Comoros (Gustav Paulay, pers. comm.). Afrocucumis africana
originally described from Mozambique specimens, covers a wide geographical range
of >40 localities from Somalia to Fiji (see Massin 1996), and has been considered
synonyms with Pseudocucumis theeli Ludwig 1887 (from Zanzibar), Phyllophorus
transvectus Sluiter 1914 (from Indonesia and near Spratly Islands), Cucumaria
assimilis Bell 1886 (from Myanmar) and Orcula cucumiformis Semper 1867 (from

NE Australia).

Materials examined: Four specimens in detail: CLAOS1 (105 mm x 40 mm,
Tomasa Point, 27 May 2009), CLA052 (58 mm x 7.75 mm, inside rock holes, Tomasa
Point, 24 May 2012), CLA0S6 (40 mm x 16 mm; in Halimeda sp., Trinchera Point,
10 May 2012), CLA066 (45 mm x 13.7 mm, under dead coral, Trinchera Point, 17
November 2012) for external morphology, internal anatomy and ossicles; 13
specimens for size range, color variation and extemal morphology (CLA0S3-
CLA055, CLA057-067); 2 specimens for CO1 sequence: PH002 (21 mm x 7.5 mm,
fission product, in crevice of dead coral, Tomasa Point, 3 September 2011) and
PHO033 (45.6 mm x 13 mm, in Caulerpa sp., Tomasa Point, 29 February 2012).

Description. External morphology: Body tapered at both ends, 8-105 mm
(mean 34 mm) long in life, 3-27 mm (mean 10 mm) wide at mid-body; weight
<0.01-10 g (mean 2.5 g). Body form variable from stout, elongated, to bottle-shaped,
with truncate posterior or anterior; cross-section variable from roughly quadrangular
(isosceles trapezoid) with concave interradials (Figs. 4.11A-B, 4.12B), to
pentangular, to cylindrical (Figs. 4.11C-E, 4.12A). Body wall thick (0.3-3.6 mm,
mean 1.8 mm), of “rubbery” consistency; often creased interradially and lumpy (when
podia are contracted) or spiky (when podia are extended). Dominant dorsal ground
colors vary between pale pinkish yellow (peach), brownish yellow, light brown, dark
brown, purplish brown, purplish grey and off-black with irregular patches of darker

shades; ventral ground color and immediate vicinities of podia (when podia are


extended) often of lighter tint than dorsal ground color; regenerated portions of
fissioned or scarred individuals always lighter in color than the rest of the body; color
fades quickly but only partially in ethanol.

Dorsal and ventral mid-body podia similar in size and form, arranged in
irregularly-paired rows of variable number: in small (<25 mm) to medium-sized (26-
50 mm) specimens, usually 2 rows per radii; in large specimens (>50 mm), usually 2
rows per radii at anterior and posterior ends gradually increasing to 4-6 rows at mid-
body, encroaching into interradii. Podia stalks translucent and lighter than body color
in life (whitish in ethanol), soft, slender, highly extendible and fully retractable.
Anteriormost podia distinctive, less retractable, in 1-2, 2-3 and 3-4 pairs in small,
medium and large specimens, respectively; when extended length (1.6-8.5 mm, mean
4 mm) much greater than mid-body podia (0.5-3 mm, mean 1.5 mm) and
posteriormost 3 pairs of podia (0.2-1.6 mm, mean 0.9 mm). Terminal disk prominent,
cylindrical (diameter 0.17-0.8 mm, mean 0.5 mm), with yellow-orange inner ring and
pale yellow rim.

Tentacles 20, dendritic, in 3 relative sizes and 2 configurations. Medium and
large tentacles with approximately 8-12 primary branches spirally attached around
the stalk; small tentacles with exactly 4 primary branches arranged in 2 pairs, the
proximal pair distinctly oriented towards the mouth. In most small to medium-sized
specimens tentaclesare in 1 ring (Fig. 4.12C1), with a pair of large tentacles per
interradius alternating with a pair of small and medium-sized tentacles per radius. In
all large and some small to medium-sized specimens tentacles in 2 rings (15+5; Fig.
4.122), with a pair of large tentacles per interradius altemating with a medium-sized
tentacle per radius in the outer ring, and with a small single radial tentacle per radius

in the inner ring. Tentacles commonly vary between bright yellow, brownish yellow,


light brown, dark brown with varying amounts of very dark brown to black
variegation; tentacles from smaller or regenerated individuals usually without
variegation and with translucent yellow to light brown stalk and yellow branches
(individuals with off-white to dark brown body color) or dark brown to black stalks
and branches (individuals with off-black body color). Introvert 1.5~4 mm long,
without podia, color intermediate between body and tentacles. Mouth terminal. Anus
terminal, with five minute anal teeth in small specimens.

Internal anatomy. Calcareous ring (Fig. 4.12) unsegmented, with all plates
separated from each other (inter-plate gaps 0.20.4 mm, mean 0.3 mm), loosely held
together by connective tissue. Radial plates long and wide, mean 1.8 mm x 0.7 mm
(length x width), 4.1 mm x 1.3 mm and 6.9 mm x 2.3 mm in small, medium and large
specimens, respectively; anterior margin with indentation for the attachment of
retractor muscles; posterior margin with two extensions that reach the water vascular
ting, proportionally longer in large specimens (Fig. 4.12D3). Interradial plates long
and narrow, mean 1.4 mm x 0.2 mm (length x width), 3.3 mm x 0.5 mm and 6.8 mm
x 1.0 mm in small, medium and large specimens, respectively; anterior margins
tapered or truncated; posterior margins with a hint of bifurcation. Radial plates 0-20%
longer and 210-270% wider than interradial plates across specimen sizes.

Buccal retractor muscles flat and thin (0.4-1.0 mm wide) except near
attachment ends, 20-50 mm long in medium-targe specimens, splitting off from
longitudinal muscles at first third to half of body length from anterior (in specimens
with unretracted introvert). Longitudinal muscles undivided along entire body length,
medially attached, lateral margins free, flattened oval cross-section (0.4-1 mm wide,
<0.5 mm high). Polian vesicles tubular (diameter 0.4-0.7 mm, mean 0.6 mm), 10-12,

divided equally between short (0.4-3.1 mm, mean 1.8 mm) and long ones (2.6~7.5


mm, mean 5.1 mm), concentrated in lateral and ventral portions of the water vascular
ring; color translucent white with dark speckles in life, uniformly greyish in alcohol.
Stone canals very short and convoluted, ~20-30, extending free into body cavity,
usually concealed by Polian vesicles, each terminating with a small, spherical
madreporite (diameter 0.2-0.4 mm). Podia ampullae bulbous (diameter 0.4-1.2 mm,
mean 0.8 mm), protruding freely into body cavity, concentrated radially in irregular
rows, rarely found interradially (corresponding to podia distribution). Gonad in two
tufts; gonad tubules long (2.6-21 mm, mean 11 mm) and relatively wide (diameter
0.4-0.8 mm, mean 0.6 mm), pinkish grey to yellow, bifurcated near their base.
Respiratory tree light yellowish brown with two main stalks arising independently
from cloacal bulb and extending to about half of body length (20-60 mm). Intestines
yellowish brown, tightly coiled, thick and about twice the body in length when
stretched out (74-215 mm). Cloaca 10.5-20 mm (~1/4 of body length); cloacal
retractor muscles relatively prominent.

Ossicles. Dorsal and ventral body wall with numerous tables, of variable
form. Regular tables (Figs. 4.13A and C), 80-165 um (mean 127 ym) mace-like in
general appearance with small, simple basal disk, 2~4 small completely fused pillars
that form a relatively tall, straight and smooth, rod-like structure, ending in a spire
with >12 spines (5-9 jm long). Some tables irregular (Figs. 4.13B and C), with only
0-8 spines variably arranged, pillars fused partially. Dorsal and ventral mid-body
podia with regular and irregular tables similar to those in body wall; irregular-shaped,
elongated plates (Fig. 4.13G), 78-216 ym (mean 168 pm) wide; and large circular
endplates (Fig. 4.12F), 274-455 im (mean 357 um) wide. Anteriormost podia with
irregular plates, endplates, tables similar to those in mid-body podia, and additional

forms of irregular tables (Fig. 4.13E). Introvert, tentacle stalk and peristome with


shorter, irregular tables (53-108 pm, mean 78 um; Fig. 4.13D) having more
prominent basal disk, incomplete fusion of pillars or additional one or two spires.
Introvert, buccal membrane, tentacles stalk and tentacle branches with
asymmetrical rosettes (Fig. 4.12F), 18-65 ym (mean 38 pm) long, ranging from
simple, rod-like with few short branches, to complex, oval to elongated with 3-4
levels of branching, all thin and rod-like in lateral view. Ossicles absent in the
intestines, gonad, respiratory tree, buccal retractor muscles and longitudinal muscles.

Remarks: This study presents the third Philippine record of Cladolabes
schmelizii. The first record is by Sluiter (1901) with a specimen from Tawi-Tawi; the
description, however, is based on specimens from Indonesia. The second is by Reyes-
Leonardo (1984) from Bolinao, which are all dark brown (lighter ventrally), with
irregularly scattered podia, and possess rod-like tables. While these characters may be
confused with other Cladolabes species, especially hamatus (discussed below), this
study confirms schmelizii presence in the general area indicated by Reyes-Leonardo,
whereas no hamatus has yet been found.

Cladolabes schmelizii is among most common dendrochirote species within its
range (Australia, Central Pacific and China; see synonymy section, and distribution
map by Massin 1999). Two of the specimens in this study (PH002 and PHO33) have
CO1 sequences that match with those identified as schmeltzii elsewhere (e.g. Lizard
Is. and Papua New Guinea; Paulay, unpublished). Substantial variations in the table
ossicles, calcareous ring, podia distribution, presence of anal teeth, body shape, body
color, and tentacle arrangement were observed, but remain in general agreement with
those of Ludwig (1875) and other accounts (e.g. Sluiter 1901, Heding & Panning

1954, Liao 1997, Massin 1999, Dautov 2011).


The regular tables of the body wall and podia that are mace-like (Fig. 4.124; also
described as momingstar-like or rod-like) have been considered very characteristic of
schmelizii (Bell 1884, Théel 1886, Clark 1938, Massin 1999). The regular tables did
not noticeably differ in size and overall appearance based on specimen size, contrary
to observations by Clark (1938) and Deichmann (1944). Interspersed among the
regular forms are the irregular tables that were perhaps unreported (Figs. 4.13B-E).
Both forms of body wall tables are most similar to those of hamatus (see Deichmann
1944, Heding & Panning 1954, Mucharin 2008), however, hamatus also have podial
tables with a shape reminiscent of a “sorcerer’s hat” (Mucharin 2008). Ossicles
among <8 mm individuals may provide information on its early development not
captured in this study.

The calcareous rings of small specimens (Fig. 4.12D1) are very similar to those
figured by Liao (1997) and Dautov (2011), whereas of large specimens (Fig. 4.12D3)
more similar to those by Ludwig (1875) and Massin (1999). Radial plate heights
increase with body length but varied in proportion from ~1/4~1/8 (24-12%) in small
to medium-sized specimens, to ~1/8-1/16 (12-6%) in large specimens; these values
(6-25%) suggest that the 1/5 (20%) reported in previous studies (Ludwig 1875,
Massin 1999, Dautov 2011) is not fixed for this species but vary ontogenetically.

The distribution of podia appears to be related to body length, as noted by Massin
(1999), and has been variably described as: few dorsal radially, two rows ventral
radially (small specimens; Sluiter 1901); two rows dorsal radially, four rows ventral
radially (small to large specimens; Massin 1999, Dautov 2011); scattered irregularly
(small specimens; Reyes-Leonardo 1984); and spread uniformly distributed
throughout the body (medium to large specimens; Ludwig 1875). However, neither

the uniform nor the irregularly scattered distribution of podia seems to characterize


schmeltzii. Another trait that appears related to size is that anal teeth are found only in
small specimens (Heding & Panning 1955, Massin 1999, this study), suggesting loss
with age. No other Cladolabes species is known to possess anal teeth.

In situ observations indicate that the cross-sectional shape varies from
quadrangular (Figs. 4.11A~B and 4.12B) when the animal forms a creeping sole on a
relatively even surface, to roughly pentangular when it is or overturned (Fig. 4.11C)
or clinging onto macroalgae. Cylindrical cross-section (Figs. 4.11D10-11) is
observed in stress animals, such as when they are held in foul seawater or when
ethanol is poured onto unanesthetized specimens. This may explain the apparent
contradiction in literature between the cylindrical (Ludwig 1875, Heding & Panning
1954, Liao 1997), and pentagonal cross-section (Massin 1999, Dautov 2011). The
body is also usually gently tapered at both ends but truncated in recently fissioned
individuals (Figs. 4.11D1, DS) and bottle-shaped in individuals with regenerated parts
(Fig. 4.11D9).

Clark (1938) observed that the body color of schmeltzii varies from yellow, to
flesh-red, to brown, to olive and to blackish in the field, and from light brown, to deep
purplish-brown and to almost black in preserved specimens. Subsequent descriptions
of color further varied from yellow brown with violet sheen (preserved; Heding &
Panning 1954), to yellow-orange (beige-brown in alcohol; Massin 1999), to dark
brown (yellowish white in alcohol; Liao 1997), to reddish black (Dautov 2011). This
study records all of the above coloration. The only peculiar coloration not found is
Ludwig’s (1875) “five more or less distinct blue-grey longitudinal stripes”. As with

Clark, the diverse coloration does not seem to be related to specimen size or general

locality.


The arrangement of tentacles in schmeltzii was originally described by Ludwig
(1875) as two rings (10 in the outer and 10 in the inner ring) whereas both Heding &
Panning, and Liao indicate 3 rings (10+5+5). This study considered a ring to consist
of tentacles that do not overlap in alignment with other sets when concentric circles
are drawn, as this appears to be how Ludwig (1892) defines it. Thus, the I-ring
arrangement was determined for the overlapping alignment (Fig. 4.12C1), whereas
the 2-ring arrangement for the outer large and medium tentacles and inner small
tentacles (Fig. 4.12C2). The variable descriptions may be due to the lack of a standard
definition of a ring (given that no clear demarcations can be seen), and the observed

difference between small and large specimens.

Family Phyllophoridae Oestergen 1907
5, Stolus Selenka 1867

Diagnosis (amended from Thandar 2005 and Arumugam 2011): Small to
medium sized and firm-bodied phyllophorids with 10 tentacles, 2 of which (mid-
ventral) much shorter. Podia numerous, small, cylindrical, distributed over entire
body, absent on introvert. Anal teeth absent or rudimentary. Calcareous ring
conspicuously tubular or funnel-shaped, composite, with processes enveloping the
large buccal bulb; radial plates with long, paired and segmented posterior processes;
base of interradial plates extending posteriorly. Polian vesicles and stone canals
variable in number, usually multiple.

Ossicles of body wall smooth or nodulous buttons with 4 holes, mostly with
10-12 marginal nodules, or irregular with more holes and nodules; some nodulous
buttonswith ring-like structure arising from one or both sides; or (3) rarely, complex,

multi-layered scales (S. rapax and S. kilberti). Ossicles of podia mostly with (1) wide


accessory end plates in addition to endplates, and (2) large plates with 4 central holes
in cross-shaped plan and 2 distal projections, or (3) large table-like plates with basal
disk similar in configuration as large plates, but with 2-pillared spire-like structures.
Ossicles of introvert include plates or plate-like tables. Ossicles of tentacles include
rosettes, rods and plates.

Remarks: The amended genus diagnosis includes and clarifies traits already
known for most Stolus species. There are 14 nominal species under the genus (Paulay
2014), 6 of which have been described within the past two decades. Thandar (2005)
provided a revised key for 13 Stolus species (excluding S. minutus HL Clark 1938).
Recently, Arumugam (2012) proposed that Thyone species with “half-rings” to their
body wall buttons should be transferred to Solus. Ultimately, a revision of the genus
requires a clearer understanding of the type species S. sacellus Selenka 1867 and S.
buccalis Stimpson 1855, of which the former has been considered a junior synonym.
We note that the synonymy of S. buccalis, namely, S. sacellus, T. rigida, Stereoderma
murrayi Bell 1883, T. buccalis var. pallida HL Clark 1938 and T. buccalis lourdesae
(judged by James 1966, Marenzeller 1882, Pearson 1903 and Clark 1946), was based
on partial matches of traits described in literature, and not on re-examination of the
relevant types. Thus, we recommend a review of the five names using their type
specimens to test their synonymy with buccalis.

Taxonomic history of Stolus buccalis: Stimpson’s (1855) original description of
Thyone buccalis focused on the calcareous ring as the most distinctive character, and
provided no information on the ossicles and other internal structures. From additional
specimens, Semper (1868) described many traits of buccalis but did not indicate
whether he had compared it with the holotype. Since Semper did not contradict the

original diagnosis, his specimens may have fully agreed with Stimpson (see also


Théel 1886). Semper’s figure for the nodulous buttons with rings is a trait that
subsequent authors found most recognizable for buccalis. However, this ossicle is not
unique to buccalis, and is a generic trait of Stolus (see diagnosis above, and
Arumugam 2012).

Selenka (1867) later erected the genus Solus with sacellus as type species. Stolus
sacellus also possesses the nodulous buttons with rings and appears to only differ
substantially from buccalis in the absence of anal teeth. Semper (1868) hastily
transferred sacellus to Thyone, and Stolus was relegated as junior synonym. Semper
also described Thyone rigida, which had rigid and wrinkled body, and very similar
body wall ossicle to his buccalis specimens. Semper did not mention the presence or
absence of anal teeth. Semper considered rigida, buccalis and sacellus as separate
species, despite their similarities, especially in the ossicles.

Synonymies within buccalis, sacellus and rigida began with Marenzeller (1882)
who considered rigida a junior synonym of sacellus based on what he determined as a
sacellus specimen from Japan and a comparison of the original descriptions.
Marenzeller ignored the differences in body wall rigidity (e.g. unlike rigida, his
sacellus specimens were not rigid), body color, and the number of stone canals among
the referred descriptions, probably considering them as naturally variable. Théel
(1886) accepted Marenzeller’s synonymy, and further considered buccalis and
sacellus (+rigida) to completely resemble each other, except for the rudimentary anal
teeth in buccalis, and remarked that these species may prove to be identical.

Bell’s (1883) description and figures for Stereoderma murrayi also had the long,
composite calcareous ring with posterior extension and the nodulous buttons with
rings that already characterized buccalis, sacellus and rigida. Pearson (1903)

considered murrayi a junior synonym of sacellus and identical to two of his


specimens from Sri Lanka, based on descriptions. Pearson’s (1903, 1910) accounts
for sacellus, however, indicate additional large plate ossicles with “irregular, massive
superstructure bearing numerous spines,” which has not been reported for sacellus.

HL Clark (1938) described Thyone buccalis var. pallida, which differed from
buccalis in color and several ossicles (e.g. in the tentacles). HL Clark (1946)
synonymized sacellus (+rigida and murrayi) and buccalis var. pallida under Thyone
buccalis based on the ossicle similarities, ignoring traits that have been described
differently (e.g, anal teeth, numbers of Polian vesicles, stone canals, and body color).
HL Clark (1946) may be unaware that Heding (1940) had earlier re-established the
genus Stolus and re-designated sacellus as type species.

Panning (1949) and Cherbonnier (1955 and 1958 in AM Clark 1963 and James
1966, respectively) did not follow HL Clark’s synonymy and continued to use the
name sacellus. On the other hand, Domantay (1962) described Thyone buccalis
lourdesae and seem to have favored HL Clark’s synonymy. AM Clark (1963), aware
of these issues, proposed to suppress the older name buccalis so as not to invalidate
name sacellus, which was more widely used despite its lack of priority. James (1966),
however, accepted HL Clark’s opinion that sacellus is a junior synonym of buccalis.
James also assigned buccalis to Stolus, and synonymized Domantay’s Thyone
buccalis lourdesae under the new name combination, Stolus buccalis. This name
combination and, in part, the synonymy of James have been adapted by many

subsequent authors (e.g. Cherbonnier 1988, Thandar 1990, Liao 1997).

mm x 10 mm, inside a hole on a dead coral, Tomasa Point, 27 June 2008), STO006
(50 mm x 13 mm, 7.5 g, under rock, between crevice, Trinchera Point, 5 October
2012), STOOS7 (58 mm x 15 mm, 5.07 g, tentacles feeding, body between crevice,
Trinchera Point, 18 November 2012) and STO0S9 (48 x 17 mm, 4.8 g, taken with
STO05S7). Two specimens for CO1 sequence: PHOO! (27 mm x 6.5 mm, in dead
corals with turf algae, tentacles eviscerated, Tomasa Point, 2 September 2011) and
PHO31 (61 mm x 16 mm, between coralline rock crevice, Tomasa Point, 23 February
2012).

Description: External anatomy: Body elongated and tapered at both ends,
10-94 mm long (mean 33 mm) in life, 4-30 mm (mean 11 mm) at mid-body; weight
1-14 g (mean 6 g). Body cross-section varies between subcylindrical to roughly
pentangular (Fig. 4.14F). Body wall thick (0.3-2.3 mm, mean 1.1 mm), firm, with
fine chalky particles containing ossicles on its surface (easily abraded by hand);
highly contracted specimens with deep crosswise creases and mounds around podia,
more pronounced ventrally. Dorsal ground color in live specimens vary between dark
reddish brown, purplish brown, greyish brown and pale brown, without variegation
except for lighter patches in wounded or abraded areas; ventral ground color and
mounds around podia often of lighter tint; color slightly fades in alcohol.

Dorsal and ventral mid-body podia similar in size and form. Podia arranged in
2-4 distinct rows per radius, and 2—4 scattered rows per interradius. Podia stalks same
color as body, soft, slender (when extended, 0.4-2.2 mm, mean 1.2 mm long;

diameter~0.3 mm), highly extendible especially radially and anteriorly (typically


longer), and completely retractable. Podia disk brown, cylindrical and relatively small
(diameter 0.2-0.5 mm, mean 0.3 mm).

Tentacles 10, dendritic, arranged in one ring (Fig. 4.14E): 8 very long
tentacles (3.75-22 mm, mean 11.4 mm when extended, or ~ of body length) with up
to 20 primary branches spirally attached around the stalk; 2 short tentacles (~% the
length of longer tentacles) ventro-medially located with 4 primary branches arranged
in 2 pairs, the proximal pair distinctly oriented towards the mouth. Tentacle stalk
color either translucent grey or blackish with maroon, bright yellow green and white
reticulation, varying widely in color dominance; branches from large tentacles of
similar color while branches from short tentacles usually whitish; bright colors mostly
lost in ethanol. Introvert very prominent (length: 2.5-20 mm), bulbous, can be
retracted completely, without podia; color similar to tentacles and usually darker than
body color. Gonopore located between mid-dorsal tentacle pair (Fig. 4.14E)
surrounded with a stump-like outgrowth in females or by one to several papillae in
males (Fig. 4.14G). Mouth terminal. Pharyngeal complex (i.e. tentacles, introvert,
calcareous ring and ring canal), anterior part of retractor muscles and esophagus, and
some gonad tubules readily eviscerated when animal is manipulated or stressed. Anus
terminal surrounded by five triangular anal teeth; thick margin around the anus forms
a valve that closes the cloaca and is surrounded by five pairs of small, radially
arranged podia.

Internal anatomy. Calcareous ring (Fig. 4.14H) very elongated (12-25 mm,
mean 17 mm), funnel-shaped in overall outline, with 10 composite plates (5 radial and
5 interradial) having numerous, highly calcified segments, and coated by thin,
translucent connective tissue. Anterior section of radial plates with truncated tip and

ridged lateral margins (between which the retractor muscles attach); paired posterior


radial plate extension, very long (9.6-20 mm, mean 14 mm) and narrow, composed of
numerous tubular segments (up to 20 pieces per extension). Anterior margin of
interradial plates triangular in shape, composed of one or several calcareous elements;
interradial plate composed of an assemblage of very numerous, small, irregularly-
shaped and -sized calcareous elements (up to 130 pieces per interradial plate) that
forms a “mantle” between radial plate extensions.

Buccal retractor muscles 4.6-14 mm (mean 9 mm) long, 0.5-1.4 mm (mean
0.6 mm) wide. Longitudinal muscles 0.4-0.9 mm (mean 0.6 mm) wide, undivided,
subcylindrical in cross-section. Four Polian vesicles all on ventral side of body,
tubular to sac-like, tapering to a point, 5-20 mm (mean 12 mm) long, translucent
white. Stone canals 8-22 concentrated in ventral and lateral portion of body in one or
two clusters, white, straight, short (0.4-1.0 mm, mean 0.7 mm) and thin (~0.1 mm),
freely hanging, each terminating in a white or pale yellow, bean-shaped madreporite
(diameter 0.3-0.8 mm, mean 0.5 mm). Podia ampullae lanceolate, 0.15~-0.3 mm
(mean 0.2 mm) wide, 0.2-2.2 mm (mean 0.8 mm) long, protruding freely,
concentrated radially in irregular rows, but also spreading into interradius. Gonad in
two tufts; tubules unbranched, yellow (female) or greyish (male?), up to 15 mm long,
diameter mean 0.2 mm without eggs and mean 0.6 mm with eggs; in specimens with
large eggs (diameter ~0.4 mm), gonad occupy most of the coelom; eggs positively
buoyant and yolk-filled. Respiratory tree translucent or greyish pink with two stalks
arising independently from cloacal bulb, about half body length. Digestive tract from
yellowish (esophagus) to brown (intestine) or grey overall, about twice the body in
length; intestine tightly coiled. Cloacal bulb dark brown to grey, about a fourth of
body length; cloacal muscles fine and densely packed, 0.3-4.4 mm (mean 1.6 mm)

long.


Ossicles. Mid-dorsal and mid-ventral body wall with numerous, densely
packed buttons (Fig. 4.15A; basal disc diameter 40-65 um, mean 53 um) fairly
symmetrical, having 4 central holes, mostly without marginal holes (very rarely 1),
with mostly 12 (10-14) marginal nodules (mean diameter 6.4 1m), and 2 central
nodules (mean diameter 9.4 xm) from which 2 (rarely 3) a ring-like structure arise
(mean height 12.7 um) on one or both sides of the ossicle, although entirely absentit
smaller, undeveloped forms; a ringmay be terminated by minute spines (mean length
3.6 um). Peri-anal body wall with buttons identical to those in mid-dorsal/ventral
body, but with some with more elaborate rings (Fig. 4.15B). Anterior margin body
wall with buttons identical to those in mid-dorsal/ventral body wall, and slightly
larger buttons with one or more marginal holes (Fig. 4.15C). Dorsal mid-body podia
with large, circular endplates (diameter 200-252 pm, mean 230 ym), small support
plates (width 64-133 pm, mean 94 um; Fig. 4.16D) and large “two-armed” plates
with rod-like distal prolongation or “arms” on each side (width 103-193, mean 146
um; Fig. 4.16A); support plates with 4 central holes, typically 4-5 marginal holes
(range 0-11) and slightly jagged outline due to the presence of low nodules; two-
armed plates with 4 central holes and typically 1-2 (rarely 3) distal holes in each arm.
Ventral mid-body podia with endplates (diameter 209-230 im, mean 220 um; Fig.
4.15E), support plates (width 78-106 jim, mean 94 pm; Fig. 4.15E), and two-armed
plates (width 119-175 um, mean 151 pm; Fig. 4.16B) similar to those in dorsal podia
but slightly smaller, with more perforations and more jagged outline; small plates
typically with 6 marginal holes (range 0-9), more jagged and asymmetrical than in
dorsal podia; large two-armed plates with typically 1-3 (rarely 4) distal holes in each

arm.


Tentacle stalks with numerous rosettes of variable size and level of branching
(diameter 22-86 jm, mean 45 pm; up to 80 holes/branches; Fig. 4.16C) and less
numerous button- or plate-like tables (diameter 48-76 jm, mean 62 pm). Tentacle
branches with small, thin rosettes and distally perforated rods of various length (19-
69 ym, mean 46 pm). Introvert with tables in its middle region (diameter 25-109
uum, mean 50 um; Fig. 4.15E), with thin, button- or plate-like basal disc, 4 central
holes, 0-10 marginal holes, and a low, two-pillared spire. Buccal membrane with
numerous button- or plate-like tables similar to those in introvert, and large rosettes
(diameter 29-59 pm, mean 45 pm) similar to those in tentacle stalks but more
compact in appearance.

Longitudinal muscles with small pseudobutton (diameter 22-44 ym, mean 30
um) with variable number of holes, usually with smooth margins but sometimes
spiny. Retractor muscles with thin, spiny plates (diameter 35-80 um, mean 50 um)
with variable number of holes. Gonad with plates (diameter 33-63 pm, mean 47 um).
Cloacal bulb with smooth regular buttons (diameter 32-58 xm, mean 45 um) with 4
central holes, sometimes with marginal holes (2-4), without nodules in smaller forms,
with nodules in larger forms, intergrading with the nodulous buttonsof the body wall.

Remarks: Stolus buccalis has been reported from the Philippines only
through synonyms, ie. Thyone rigida Semper 1867, and T. buccalis lourdesae
Domantay 1962, which require re-examination. The specimens described above agree
well with Stimpson’s (1855) original description in external morphology and
calcareous ring detail, but not in the size of the introvert that he described as half the
body in length. The two ossicles qualitatively described by Semper (1867) and Théel
(1886), the body wall buttons and podial “rods” (considered here as two-armed

“plates”) were also found in abundance and in diverse forms (Figs. 4.15A-E and


4.16A-B). The internal morphology also matches almost completely with Semper’s
and Théel’s account except in the number of Polian vesicles and stone canals.
Common among the specimens examined and the species descriptions referred is the
presence of anal teeth, the trait considered to separate buccalis and sacellus (Théel
1886).

A combination of traits found among specimens in Bolinao previously determined
as “Stolus buccalis” indicate that they can be separated into three morphological
variants or species (for comparisons, see Fig. 4.17 and Table 4.3). This work
describes the details of only the first form, as Stolus buccalis sensu Semper 1867.
Specimens representing the second form (Fig. 4.17A), considered here as Stolus cf.
sacellus, partially match the original descriptions of Selenka (1867) for Stolus
sacellus, and Domantay (1962) for Thyone buccalis lourdesae, Thandar’s description
for “Stolus buccalis” specimens from Mozambique with soft, thin body walls, with
reticulate surface pattern (Thandar 1990), without creases, and with much smoother
texture (Thandar, pers. comm.) provides the closest comparison with the Stolus cf.
sacellus. Specimens representing the third form (Fig. 4.17B) considered here as
Stolus cf. pallida, are very similar and perhaps identical to Clark’s (1938) Thyone
buccalis pallida from Australia and Thandar’s (1990) specimen from South Africa.

The type of Stolus sacellus, which is also the type for Stolus (Heding 1940), is
probably in Gottimgen Museum in Germany, while that of Sfolus buccalis is lost and
thus require designation of a neotype (Thandar, pers. comm.). The holotype of Thyone
rigida (a junior synonym of S. buccalis) from Bohol (Semper 1867) is the Zoological
Museum of Moscow State University (Samyn et al. 2013). Further work to resolve the

issues in species synonymies require re-examination of type materials.
