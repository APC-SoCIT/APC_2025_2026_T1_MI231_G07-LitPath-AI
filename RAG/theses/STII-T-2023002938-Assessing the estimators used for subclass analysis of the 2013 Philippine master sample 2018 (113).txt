ABSTRACT

The Philippine Statistics Authority has shifted to a new design of the master sample,
which caters to all the household-based surveys it conducts. These surveys are generally
used as basis from which evidence-based policies are derived. While domain level analysis
is also of great importance, policies are usually crafted to target certain subclasses, whose
estimators are known to be ratios since sampling units at these levels are almost intractable.
To determine the appropriate method for estimating the subclasses, this paper presents a
comparative analysis of the ratio estimators and their corresponding standard errors
computed using the Taylor Series Linearization and Random Group methods. It was
theoretically shown that for a simple random sample, TSL performs better than RG in terms
of bias and precision, hence lower mean squared error. These properties are then verified
using the LFS 2016 data where unemployment rate at the domain level are computed.
Moreover, this comparison is extended to the subclass level where the validity of the variance formulas is expected to weaken due to smaller sample sizes.

CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

Motivated by the availability of a more updated basis for the construction of the
sampling frame and the need to produce reliable estimates at the subnational levels, the
Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) has shifted to a new master sample design. The
master sample is being used by all the household-based surveys conducted by the PSA. By
design, replicated samples are formed such that each replicate is able to provide a reliable
estimate of a population parameter at the domain level. Through replication, the design
also facilitates easier dropping of a replicate or two whenever budget allocation for a survey
is reduced while still providing reliable estimates at the domain level. Computationally, the
estimation of the variance is also straightforward using replicated samples since the
formula only entails the estimation of the quantity of interest at the replicate level.

Since results of many PSA surveys are also used for policy analysis, the profile of
the subdomains is essential in the decision-making. For example, youth unemployment
rates are important to local government units (LGUs) to monitor how many of the youth,
who are the country’s future, are economically active. Also, unemployment rates of men
and women are also critical to identify gender disparity, if any. These are just two examples
of data requirements to support policy from one survey, the Labor Force Survey (LFS),
which is the most frequent survey the PSA conducts. There are many other surveys,

however, that make use of the master sample, like the Family Income and Expenditure

Survey (FIES), the Annual Poverty Indicators Survey (APIS), and the National
Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). In these surveys, subdomain analysis is
important since policy research highly demands reliable statistics about the granular
classes. Moreover, since standard errors are essential to statistical inference, appropriate
estimation of the standard errors at the lower levels is of high importance.

Estimation at the subdomain level employs ratio estimation [14]. To consider this
in addition to the complex master sample design, the derivation of exact forms of the
variances is too great a task. And while a number of variance estimation (approximation)
procedures are available for use, the question now is to determine which among these
methods is the most reliable. In one landmark paper, Kish and Frankel (1974) conjectured
based on their empirical analysis that Taylor Series Linearization (TSL) performs better
than the Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) and Jackknife Repeated Replication (JRR)
when estimating the variance of simple statistics like ratio means.

Thus, this study confronts the question: Is it more appropriate to use the replicated
samples formula for the variance of an estimator for the master sample, or is it better to use

the TSL variance approximation?

1.2 Statement of the Problem

As a multi-purpose sample catering to multiple surveys with different objectives,
the replicated design of the master sample offers great ease in survey operations for the
PSA. Surveys desiring more precise estimates may now easily increase the number of

replicates to sample per domain as opposed to when the sample design is not replicated.

Since replicates are constructed by design, one can expect that variance estimates will be
computed using the RG method — not the Taylor series linearization which the PSA uses.
Hence, it is be imperative to investigate these variance estimation procedures since a good
measure of precision is required of estimates coming from the many surveys the PSA
conducts.

In this paper, primary emphasis was given on the theoretical comparison of two
variance estimation procedures, the Random Group (RG) and the Taylor Series
Linearization (TSL) methods, and their application to the master sample based on the most
recent LFS data. More specifically, this paper focused on:

1. deriving the theoretical properties of the estimates obtained using RG and TSL,
and discussing the implications of using these procedures; and

2. undertaking an empirical comparative analysis of two variance estimation
methods — the RG and TSL methods by applying them to compute the precision
of employment rate at the domain levels and also for the three subclasses: the

unpaid workers, female, and youth.

1.3 Significance of the Study

The theoretical properties of the RG and TSL methods that were derived in this
paper will contribute to the literature of variance estimation in sampling. More importantly,
this study offers better insights in the estimation procedure using the master sample,

especially for subclass analysis. In addition, the lessons learned in this study can be an

invaluable guide to the consultants of PSA in improving the design of the future master

sample.

1.4 Methodology

The following were the steps undertaken to achieve the objectives of this study:

Step 1: The sampling scheme of the 2013 MS was considered. The bias and variance of the
RG estimators for ratio estimates in the case of non-independent random groups were
then derived, and these properties were compared to their TSL counterparts.

Step 2: For the comparative analysis of RG and TSL, data cleaning was done to ensure
data accuracy and reliability. In the context of the LFS which uses 2013 MS, the
implementation of the replicated sample design was verified. In particular, the
following were done: (1) check if correct survey weights were applied to the sampling
units, (2) made sure that there is consistency in the labelling of the PSUs across the
planned domains as reported by PSA, (3) designated the employment status of the
respondents based on the given definition, and (4) corrected coding errors through
manual checking of the microdata given.

Step 3: From the validated data, the following statistics were computed: current domain
level employment rates and their corresponding standard errors using RG and TSL,
and also some quantities at the subclass level: proportion of unpaid workers among
employed persons; and female and youth employment rates. All these computations

were done using the ‘survey’ package of R.

Step 4: Verified if the conclusions based on the derived theory are consistent with the

computations done using the LFS data at hand.

PRELIMINARIES

This chapter contains the preliminary concepts needed for a better understanding
of the study. The basic results herein are gathered from various sampling books as cited

and are presented without proof.

2.1 LFS Concepts and Definitions [7, 17]

Definition 2.1.1 A barangay is the smallest political subdivision in the country, several of
which comprise one city or municipality. For purposes of enumeration in the LFS, a

barangay is considered the basic geographic enumeration area.

Definition 2.1.2 A household is an aggregate of persons, generally but not necessarily
bound by ties of kinship, who sleep in the same dwelling unit and have common
arrangements for the preparation and consumption of food. Members include the head of
the household, relatives living with him, and other persons who share the community life

for reasons of work or other consideration.

Remark 2.1.3 A person who lives alone is considered a separate household.

Definition 2.1.4 A person is in the labor force if he/she is at least 15 years old, either

employed or unemployed in accordance with the definitions described as follows.

Definition 2.1.5 Employed persons include all those who, during the reference period are

15 years old and over as of their last birthday and are reported as either:

At work. Those who do any work even for one hour during the reference period
for pay or profit, or work without pay on the farm or business enterprise operated
by a member of the same household related by blood, marriage or adoption; or
With a job but not at work. Those who have a job or business but are not at work
because of temporary illness or injury, vacation or other reasons. Likewise,
persons who expect to report for work or to start operation of a farm or business
enterprise within two weeks from the date of the enumerator’s visit are

considered employed.

Definition 2.1.6 Underemployed persons include all employed persons who express the

desire to have additional hours of work in their present job, or an additional job, or to have

a new job with longer working hours. Visibly underemployed persons are those who work

less than 40 hours during the reference period and want additional hours of work.

Definition 2.1.7 Unemployed persons include all those who, during the reference period,

are 15 years old and over as of their last birthday and reported as:

1.

2.

Without work, i.e., had no job or business during the reference period;
Currently available for work, i.e., were available and willing to take up work in
paid employment or self-employment during the reference period, and/or would
be available and willing to take up work in paid employment or self-employment
within two weeks after the interview date; and

Seeking work, i.e., had taken specific steps to look for a job or establish a
business during the reference period, or not seeking work due to the following

reasons: (1) tired or believed there is no work available (discouraged worker),

(2) awaiting results of previous job application, (3) temporary illness or

disability, (4) bad weather, and or (5) waiting for rehire or job recall.

2.2 Some Basic Concepts in Sampling [3, 9,14]

Let the finite population, or universe, of N units be indexed by U = {1,2,...,N}, and
suppose it is desired to obtain a representative subset, denoted by S, of size n from this
population. This representative subset is called a probability sample, whose mechanism of
selection requires that the probability of a unit to be included in the sample is known in
advance and that the selection of these units is randomized based on the known selection
probabilities. Some elementary types of probability samples include simple random
sample, systematic sample, stratified sample, and cluster sample. In this section, we briefly
introduce the basic concepts of these sample types.

Let 7; > 0 be defined as the known probability that unit i is included in the sample,
and that Diey 7 = YM, mj = n. Also let 7; be a characteristic of population unit i, which
is inherent to i, and is assumed to be fixed. Suppose it is of interest to estimate a population

quantity t by 7, whose value is based on the sample obtained.

Definition 2.2.1 The sampling distribution of a statistic is defined as the probability
distribution of the different values of the statistic obtained by taking all possible samples

from the population.

Definition 2.2.2 The expected value of 7, E[#], is the mean of the sampling distribution

oft:

E[é] = yy ts P(S), (2.1)

Ss

where fs is the estimate of t based on sample S and P[S] is the probability of choosing the
sample S. 7 is said to be unbiased of t if E[#] = tT; otherwise, the bias of ¢ is computed as

Bias[t] = E[#] —t.

Definition 2.2.3 An estimator f is consistent if E[¢] approaches t as n approaches N, or in

other words, if 7 = tT whenn = N.

Definition 2.2.4 The variance of 7 is defined as
Varlt] = ECE - Elé])?] = ) "és - El#)? PIS]. (2.2)
Ss

The mean squared error (MSE) of f is defined as

MSE[#] = E[(¢ — 1)?], (2.3)
and it can be shown that MSE[#] = Var[#] + (Bias[@])?. The MSE is more often used to
describe 7 since it takes into account both precision and accuracy of 7@, in terms of the

variance and the bias, respectively.

Definition 2.2.5 Other concepts used in reporting statistics are
1. The standard error (SE) of ¢, denoted by SE[#], which is the square root of the
variance of f.
2. The covariance of two estimators t, and ¢, is a bilinear function which is

defined as Cov[?#,, #2] = E[(¢, — El#1]) (#2 — El#2])].


3. The coefficient of variation of an estimator f is defined as CV[#] = coe [é]

This can be estimated by cv[7] = ¥ varlt}/

tT

Definition 2.2.6 A simple random sample (SRS) is the simplest form of probability sample.
Under this method, the units are selected with equal chances. Hence, for an SRS of size n,

T= "/y for all unit i, and the probability of selecting units i and j in the sample at the

n-1

same time is 7; = 7

zs

Proposition 2.2.7 The sample mean Ysps = n~* Vics yj obtained in an SRS of size nis
unbiased for the population mean Y. As a consequence, the estimated total Ysa5 = NVsrs

is also unbiased for the population total Y.

Proposition 2.2.8 The sample variance s? = —Dies(¥j a srs) is an unbiased
. s\2 . :
estimator of S? = ray - Y) . Hence, the estimated variance of the

mean var[Ysrs] = (1 - =) n-1s? is also unbiased for Var[Vsps] = (1 - 9) n-18?,

Definition 2.2.9 The quantity (1 — f) = 1 a is called the finite population correction

(fpc). For large-scale samples, this quantity is often assumed to be negligible.

Proposition 2.2.10 A SRS of size n = n, + n2 with mean Yeps is drawn from a finite

population with variance S?. A simple random subsample of size n, is drawn from it with


mean Ysrs,- Similarly, we denote the mean of the remaining subsample as Ysps,- Then

Var[Ysrs, | = S$? (= - =) and Cov[sas,,Ysrs,] = —-N718?,

results follow:

2. S? = 7 (NP ~ NP?)

3. var[p] = (1 ~ pee?) is unbiased for Var[p] = (1 — Ay N re

Definition 2.2.12 A systematic sample of size n is taken if from an ordered list of
population units, the sample is gathered such that the first element is chosen at random and
every k'" element, where k = N/ ns thereafter is included in the sample. The number k is

called the sampling interval which is the inverse of the sampling fraction f = Ly N:

Theorem 2.2.13 If N = nk and ¥; is the mean of the i'" systematic sample, then

Corollary 2.2.14 The mean based on a systematic sample is more precise than the mean

of a simple random sample if and only if Si.y > S?.

Definition 2.2.15 For a systematic sample, the sample variance is not an unbiased estimate

of the population variance. To estimate Var[Fsy|, the following formulas are employed:

Definition 2.2.16 In a stratified sample, the population is divided into homogeneous,
mutually exclusive subgroups called strata, and independent samples from each stratum
are obtained to improve the precision of the estimates. In obtaining a stratified sample of
size n, different sample allocation methods, each with an advantage over the others, may
be employed. Moreover, the sampling designs may, or may not, be different among the
strata.

Let there be H strata in the population, and attach the subscript h to signify that a
certain quantity is associated with stratum h. Sample allocation is said to be proportionate
if the design uses a sampling rate that is equal across all strata, ie., f = f, for all stratum

h. Otherwise, the design employs a disproportionate allocation.
Let the stratum weights W, = Nn/ n be known for all stratum h. In stratified
sampling, the mean Y = Y, WpYp is estimated by Yee = Ln Wp Yn. Additionally,

Varlse] =) Wi VarlFn] 24)

is estimated by var[¥,.] = ©, W/? varl¥,], where var[y,] is computed based on the

sampling design used in stratum h.

Definition 2.2.17 The design effect, D*[Fcomptex| is the relative measure of precision of

an estimator f under a complex design with respect to its corresponding precision for a

Var[?comptex]

SRS of the same size. That is, D?[t-omptex] = Valent
‘SRS.

Proposition 2.2.18 If the sample is allocated proportionally among the strata, then

Varl¥ge] = (1 — f) °"/p, where 52, = Dy Wy S2.

Corollary 2.2.19 The design effect of the stratified mean, under proportional allocation, is

D* [se] = Sw).

can be chosen for all h so that Var[¥,_] is minimized subject to the constraint C.

Definition 2.2.21 Cluster sampling is the sampling method wherein observation units in
the population are aggregated into larger sampling units, called clusters. Under this
method, sampling can be done in multiple stages where the first-stage sampling units are
called the primary sampling units (PSUs), and the units sampled within the selected PSUs

are called the secondary sampling units (SSUs). Although sampling can still be done in


further stages, only the PSU and SSU are introduced since sampling is usually done only

up to the second stage.

Theorem 2.2.22 (One-Stage Equal Clusters) Let there be A equal-sized clusters with B

clusters are drawn by SRS, then

Definition 2.2.22 Clustering induces a correlation between the elements in the same

CHAPTER 3

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

3.1 The 2013 Master Sample of the Philippines [17]

The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) is mandated to conduct surveys to report
official statistics of socio-economic indicators like employment rate, poverty incidence,
consumer price index, and others. To produce these statistics, data are gathered through
national household-based surveys such as the Labor Force Survey (LFS), Family Income
and Expenditure Survey (FIES), and Annual Poverty Indicators Survey (APIS), which are
carried out on a regular basis. However, with the limited resources available and the
increasing costs of data collection, the conduct of these surveys have become more difficult
to sustain. This motivated the development of a master sample design.

A master sample is a general sample from which subsamples can be drawn to serve
the needs of multiple surveys. By integrating the target populations, sampling designs, and
field operations of multiple surveys, the development and maintenance of sampling frames
can be performed more easily. Moreover, this also simplifies the sampling process of the
individual surveys thereby promoting efficiency in terms of costs and operations. In the
Philippines, the 2013 Master Sample (MS) is a remake of the 2003 MS, which was a two-
stage replicated sample with the administrative regions as its domains. However, precise
estimates from PSA’s various household-based surveys are needed at the subnational or

provincial level. Also, the 2003 MS frame needed to be updated since the availability of

the 2010 Census of Population and Housing and the 2012 Census of Agriculture and
Fisheries. For these reasons, the redesigning of the 2003 MS became necessary.

The 2013 MS is a two-stage replicated cluster sampling design which defines 117
major domains to provide precise estimates at the subnational levels: 81 provinces, 33
highly urbanized cities (HUCs), and 3 other areas namely, Pateros, Isabela, and Cotabato
City. Each domain consists of non-overlapping and well-delineated geographic areas called
primary sampling units (PSUs). Each PSU consists of 100 to 400 households; it could either
be a barangay/enumeration area (EA), a portion of a barangay, or a combination of adjacent
small barangays. A 2x2x2 implicit stratification scheme was utilized for each of the
domains. All PSUs within each domain are arranged according to North-South geographic
location, decreasing proportion of households with OFW members cut at the median, and
decreasing wealth index also cut at the median. From this ordered list of PSUs, replicates
are formed by systematically sampling a number of PSUs per domain. These replicates are
again sorted at random such that a number of replicates are selected for each survey round.
For the LFS, which is the most frequently conducted survey of PSA, four replicates were
deemed sufficient to produce reliable subnational estimates.

The secondary sampling units (SSU) of the MS design are the housing
units/households within the PSUs. For the LFS, which adopted the MS design only in its
April 2016 round, the sampling frame at this stage is constructed based on the results of
the 2015 Census of Population (CP) with the EA Reference File (EARF) of the CP used as
the frame for the PSUs and the list of households for each of the PSUs as the frame for the
SSUs. At the second stage of the sampling process, the total number of SSUs are allocated

with probability proportional to the size of the PSU. That is, larger PSUs would have more

SSUs compared to smaller PSUs. In total, 42,768 households are sampled (rounds with
Batanes sample) for each survey round. In sum, the 2013 MS is somewhat a rolling sample
design but is not a perfect one because of the varying number of rotations needed for the
PSUs to cover all of the domains. Smaller domains may get fully covered earlier compared

to larger domains where there are more PSUs.
3.2 Ratio Estimators

Some variables of interest just cannot be accommodated by linear estimators. For
example, in agriculture, crop yield is computed as total crop production divided by total
crop area. In the LFS, the employment rate is the proportion of employed persons among
those qualified to be in the labor force. The commonality of these examples is that they are
both expressed as a ratio of two variables, and the appropriate estimators for these variables
are the ratio estimators.

Let y; and x; be two characteristics of interest measured on each unit i in the

population with finite size N. If an SRS, say S, of size n is taken, the ratio quantity R =

Ny. es Vi y
oy ; is estimated by r = Lies Yi = Ve. Since both variables x and y

Lies Yi

are random, the exact distribution of r remains unknown. That is why much of the major
results in ratio estimation are based on large samples (Cochran, 1977):

1. The bias of the ratio estimator is known to be of order 1/n. This implies that r

is asymptotically unbiased, which means that its bias becomes negligible in large

samples. However, Hartley and Ross (1954) derived the exact form of the bias

of the ratio which is


Cov{[r, x] G.1)
Bias[r] = -———.

ias[r] XY
Since the formula for the bias is not computable based on a sample, Kish and
Hess (1985) showed that the bias can be adequately estimated by

; r var[x] — cov[y, x] (3.2)
Bias[r] « —————-_-.

x2
As a consequence of (3.1), it can be shown that an upper bound for the relative
bias of r is the coefficient of variation of x. Thus, if CV(x) is small, say less
than 0.10, one can say that the ratio estimation is acceptable. This is a common
practice in survey sampling to determine the adequacy of the estimate.

2. Building on the previous result, the mean squared error of rcan be validly

approximated by its sampling variance

Var[r] =

1— f [OM,0%4 — Rx)? (3.3)
nxX2 N- .

David and Sukhatme (1974) wrote an expository paper justifying the usual
approximations of the bias and the mean squared error of r.

3. Thirdly, the limiting distribution of r is the normal distribution. This result
allowed the construction of confidence intervals for variables linearly derived
from r in large samples.

In addition to variables that are inherently ratio in form, linear variables, like the
mean or total, can also be estimated using ratio by leveraging auxiliary information to
improve the precision of the estimates. This technique is a common cost-cutting practice
in survey sampling. The ratio equivalent of the linear estimators mean y and total Y = Ny

can be derived based onr. Respectively, these are ¥, =rX and¥, =rX, and their

corresponding variance formulas follow easily from (3.3). It can be noted that these
estimators require the availability of the mean and total of the characteristic x. In this
context, x is now used as an auxiliary variable exploited to improve the precision of the
estimates. In comparison, for positive R, a sufficient condition for the ratio estimators to
be more precise than their linear counterparts is when the coefficient of variation of x is

less than twice the correlation of x and y multiplied by the coefficient of variation of y.

That is, under SRS, if 2p > VEY vty then Var[P,] < Var[?].

3.3 Subclass Analysis

The general key to obtaining sufficiently precise estimates is to control the size of
the sample. The level of disaggregation at which the sample sizes are determined depends
on the objectives of the surveys. These levels are referred to as domains. However, there
are cases when important indicators need to be measured at a lower level of disaggregation
that is finer than the domain level, in which case the sample size at this level has not been
planned to satisfy a certain level of precision. These classes can be challenging to track in
the population so controlling their size in the sample poses a great challenge for the
statistician. Also, to forcefully pursue these subpopulations would be very demanding in
terms of time and effort in the operations. Although authors of some prominent books in
sampling also refer to these subpopulations as domains, these subpopulations shall be
called as subclasses or subdomains for consistency in the nomenclature of this paper. For
complex surveys, Kish and Frankel (1974) used the term crossclasses to denote the

subclasses that cut across strata in the population.

It should be noted that estimation of subclass means and totals is a special case of
the ratio estimation. Let the j" subdomain, denoted by U;, in the population be of size Nj.
Suppose that an SRS of size n is obtained and n;(< n) units in the sample belong to Uj.
Then the mean ¥; of the j subdomain is estimated by 9; = nj~* Lies, ¥i- Similarly, its
domain total is estimated by yj = N;,y;. Although both estimators seem to take the same
linear form as Ysgs and Ysgs in Proposition 2.2.7, the important difference is the
randomness of the subclass sample sizes n; in the denominator. In taking the SRS, only the
sample size n is fixed by the design. In effect, if the sampling procedure is repeated several
times, the quantity n, will vary from sample to sample, therefore, 7; and y are both ratio
estimators. Consequently, the properties of ratio estimators mentioned in the previous
section also apply to y; and Yj. Hence, the variance estimator of the domain mean is given
by

_ ny n (nj -1)s;”
van i= (1- Rana

,

where s;” is the estimated standard error of the jth subdomain.

For large subclass sample sizes, the variance estimator above approximately
simplifies to varz [x] (1 - *) L, which is the variance formula in the SRS case given

in Proposition 2.2.8. However, for small samples, the quantities — and a are both

approximately equal 1. Based on the formula, the disparity between both estimators is

caused by the multiplier a 7 mart a quantity that is always less than one. Thus, subdomain

estimation should not be complacently approximated by SRS formulas since var [¥;]

overestimates var; [¥;]. However, for large samples, the difference of these variances is

considerably negligible.
3.4 Variance Estimation

It is a general observation that the mathematical structure of variance formulas
mainly depend on the complexity of both the estimator and the design on which sampling
is based. This is reflected by how congested the literature of sampling statistics is for simple
estimators, like means and totals under simple designs like simple random sampling (SRS)
and stratified random sampling; and the opposite for nonlinear estimators under complex
designs. All components that make a survey complex, e.g. stratification, clustering, unequal
probabilities, and weighting adjustments due non-sampling errors, must be reflected on the
variance formula, which make it more difficult for theorists to derive its closed form.

Many practicing statisticians still do not realize the significance of variance
estimation in making statistical inferences. For example, when standard errors of
differences of two subpopulations are seriously underestimated, shorter confidence
intervals are constructed about the parameters. As a dual, hypothesis tests about the
differences of subpopulations will more likely become significant; a detrimental mistake
which will eventually ripple to misinformed policy interventions.

Research on this area was pioneered by Kish and Frankel (1974) when they
conducted an empirical comparative analysis of three variance estimation procedures
namely, Taylor Series Linearization (TSL), Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR), and

Jackknife Repeated Replication (JRR), under a stratified single-stage cluster design where

two clusters were selected with replacement (epsem) from each stratum. This study raised
more problems on variance estimation, opening a lot of research opportunities for others.
Among the notable researches that followed were done by Krewski and Rao (1981), Rao
and Wu (1985), Rao and Wu (1988), and Rao ef al. (1992). An excellent review on
comparison of variance estimation procedures was done by Rust (1985). At present,
empirical and theoretical studies are still encouraged especially now that data-driven

decisions are the norm.

3.4.1 Random Group Method

Variance estimation formulas become more cumbersome as the sampling design of
surveys gets more complex, that is, when the survey design employs stratification,
clustering, and/or unequal selection probabilities. To provide a simpler estimation
procedure for the complex variance formulas, Mahalanobis (1940, 1958) proposed that
estimates based on subsets of the complete sample should be computed and the desired
estimate and its corresponding variance is derived from these computed values. In these
pioneer papers, the author referred to these subsamples as interpenetrating samples or
replicated networks of units. Later on, several alternative terms such as replicated samples,
ultimate clusters, and random groups, were coined by different authors but still pertain to
the same method.

Under this method, the random groups (RG) are constructed by independently
replicating a general sampling design G(= 2) times in the population. The independence

of the RG is based on the notion that a sampling scheme is repeatedly applied G times to

the population of interest while replacing the chosen units in the population every time a
RG is formed. Moreover, since the various groups have a common sampling design, the
resulting G estimates are independent and identically distributed (iid), and have the same
estimation procedures. Although replicated samples and random groups use the same
estimation procedure, a particular distinction between these two has now been established
to avoid confusion. Replicated samples are formed by design such as the 2013 MS
described in Section 3.1, whereas random groups can be designated after the design has
been implemented. This was done when computers are still rare so that random groups
became an approach merely for variance computation. In this paper, these two terms are
used with caution.
In the notations of Lohr (2009), let @ be the parameter of interest and 0; be the
estimate of 9 computed from the i" random group. Then the following results describe the

random group estimator of @ and its corresponding variance.

Theorem 3.4.1 [23] Let 9,,62,...,8¢ be uncorrelated random variables with common

expectation E(4;] =u. Let 6 be defined 6 = ; @ ,9;. Then E[8] = p and an unbiased

estimator of Var[6] is given by var[6] = on ¢ (6, — 6)?.

Corollary 3.4.2 [23] If the estimators 6;,i = 1,2,...,G, are unbiased for @, then @ is also

unbiased for 6.

The above results provide exact theory for parameters — usually linear — whose

unbiased estimators are available. These parameters and their corresponding variances can

be unbiasedly estimated using the formulas above. However, such is generally not the case
especially for parameters taking nonlinear forms, like the ratio and regression coefficients.
No matter how slightly, bias incurred in the random groups cause the estimators under this
method to be biased as well.

In actual practice, most surveys fail to satisfy the assumption of independence
among the random groups. Survey samples are usually drawn as a single sample and the
formation of the random groups follow afterward. The challenge here is to divide the
complete sample into G random groups such that each possesses the same statistical
properties as the whole sample. Wolter (2007) outlined some techniques in forming these
groups from various sampling designs and combinations of these techniques can be
employed for complex designs. For this case of non-independent RG, if the population is
large and the sampling rate is small, the random groups may be treated as though they are
independent and the formulas in Theorem 3.4.1 can be used to compute for the desired
estimate and its corresponding estimated variance. Clearly, the variance estimator for this
case is not unbiased; the following theorem shows the effect of non-independence on the
variance estimator.

Theorem 3.4.3 [23] Let 9, be defined as above and let ug = E[8,]. Then

G
. 1
w= E[6] = =), Has
a=1

and the expectation of the random group estimator of Var[6] is given by

G 6 G
P P 1 2 AA
E [var[4]]| = Var[4] + wea 2 — 4) - Woy 2 Cov[8q, 4].
a= a=1B>a

Further, if each random group is the same size, then uy = u(a = 1,...,G), and
E [var[6]| = Var[6] — Cov[6,, 4].

The method of random group possesses remarkable computational advantage to
other variance estimation techniques. It can be used to estimate the variances of complex
estimators without the need for computer software provided that random group estimates
are available. However, this advantage has become less meaningful at present mainly
because fast computers now enable easier computation of variance estimates even when
dealing with large amounts of data. Also, when designing surveys of national coverage,
especially a master sample, the replicates are determined at the design stage; applying
random groups design for the purposes of easier computations, after the survey data have
been collected is challenging and is impractical since other variance approximation

methods can be used.
3.4.2 Taylor Series Linearization (TSL) Method

In analytical surveys, parameters of interest commonly take nonlinear forms as
opposed to descriptive surveys where population means and totals are mostly desired.
Examples of nonlinear parameters include ratio, difference of ratios, regression and
correlation coefficients, and many others. While these are essential in various statistical
analyses, the prevailing predicament when dealing with parameters of this type is that, their
estimators take nonlinear forms as well. And as a usual consequence, the variance of these
estimators does not have known closed forms, which makes it more difficult to find simple

unbiased estimators for the variance.

The Taylor Series Linearization approach provides an effective solution to the
problem brought about by the nonlinearity of the estimators. By its name, this method

employs the Taylor’s Theorem, which is stated below

Theorem 3.4.4 [23] (Taylor’s Theorem) Let g(Y) be a real-valued function defined on p-
dimensional Euclidean space with continuous partial derivatives of order 2 in an open

sphere containing Y,, and a. Then,

F (3.4)
a(n) = 9(a) +) 9S + ena),

a7 g(3 0 A A
where R,(Y,,a) = Dyes Doon gover, (Yin — Yj) Yin — Yd, IO) yy is the partial

derivative of g(Y) with respect to the j element of Y evaluated at Y=a, and
07g(a) . : ee .
ay,a¥, is the second partial derivative of g(Y) with respect to Yj and Y; evaluated

at Y = 4, and 4 is on the line segment joining Y, and a.

It aims to linearize the estimators to facilitate easier variance approximations. In
this method, the original nonlinear estimator is first approximated as a finite sum of
estimators (whose variance formulas are preferably available) using Taylor’s expansion
and use the variance of the obtained sum to estimate the variance of the original estimator.
Also, another result in large-sample theory describing the consistency of TSL estimators is

stated below.

Theorem 3.4.5 [23] Let ¥, = a+ O,(%), where 7%, > 0 as n > 0. Then g(Y,) may be

expressed as in (3.4), where R,(¥n,a) = Op(r7?).


Let Y = (¥%,...,¥,)’ be a p-dimensional vector of population parameters and let

Y=(%, we Vp)! be a vector of natural estimators corresponding to the components of Y.
Suppose that @ = g(Y) is a well-defined nonlinear function that satisfies the assumptions
in Theorem 3.4.4. Then the Taylor series expansion of 6 = 9(¥) about @ can be easily
computed. In survey applications, the remainder in the series expansion is discarded and
the retained linear terms are given priority in the development of the variance
approximation. One will notice that this practice simply reduces the variance of the
nonlinear estimator @ to a sum of variances and covariances of the estimators Y;s if the
linearization is only up to the second order. Moreover, if these variance-covariance terms
are consistent, it directly follows from Theorem 3.4.5 that the estimator of the variance is
consistent as well. Several empirical studies have pointed out that this first-order
approximation is satisfactory in estimating the desired variance, especially for large-scale
sample surveys where the bias using this method essentially becomes negligible (Rust,
1985).

The linearization method in variance estimation has been extensively used by
survey practitioners especially when complex nonlinear estimators with continuous
derivatives are of interest. With the recent technology, packages for various Statistical
softwares, e.g., SAS, STATA, and R, are made available and use this method as default in

estimating variances.


3.4.3 Example: Variance Estimation of
the Simple Ratio

In this section, TSL and RG are illustrated using this estimator. Suppose that it is
desired to estimate the ratio quantity g(Y,X) = R= Vly, where Y and X are the

population totals of some characteristics x and y. Suppose that based on a sample S of size

n from a finite population of size N, the estimator gf, x) =r= P/ ep where Y and X are
the usual estimators for Y and X tivel loyed. Since % = + and % = —4
usual estimators for Y and X, respectively, is employed. Since = = 7 and 5 = — y;

then the first-order linear approximation of r is
1, ae
reR+>(%-Y)- p(k -%).
Hence, the TSL variance estimator of r is

var[?] , varl’} ry
cn Cs 62 :

varrs_[r] =r (ae

The estimates of the variance and covariance terms above depend on the sampling design.
Now, suppose that exhaustive and mutually exclusive subsamples 5;,i = 1,...,G,

of sizes m = "To are formed, where m is assumed to be a positive integer. Hence, the
sample 5 = Ue, Si and S; NS; = @,i # j. Let qi = ", to be the ratio estimator based

on S;. Then the RG estimator is G = a qi and its corresponding estimated variance is
varro lq] = Cam © 4(4i — Grc)?. In particular, if S is a SRS and S,,...,S¢ are simple

random subsamples, it follows from Theorem 3.4.3 and Proposition 2.2.10 that

Bias[vargc[q]] = N~1S?, where S? is the population variance.

CHAPTER 4

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Properties of the RG and TSL Estimators
for the Variance of the Ratio

This section presents some essential properties in the comparison of the estimators
of RG and TSL for the ratio quantity R = YIy, where Y and X are the population totals of
some characteristics y and x, respectively. For easier derivation, the 2013 MS design was
simplified while retaining the non-independence but identical distributions of the replicates
and attach the subscript i to refer to the i" replicate. Consider G mutually exclusive SRS,
denoted by Sj,i = 1,2,...,G each with size equal to m = "Io: Let y; and x; be the usual
estimators for the characteristic totals of y and x based on S;. Then an estimator for R based
on this sample is q; = y;/x; whose corresponding standard error can be computed directly.

Since each S; is an SRS by itself, the pooled sample S = UE, S; is also an SRS of
size n. Let Y and X be the usual estimators for Y and X, respectively, and r = *e be the
estimator of R computed from S. Notice that these follow the same notations as in the
example in Subsection 3.4.3 but with a slight difference in the construction of the samples.
From here on, the theory that will follow pertains to the design briefly described. Prior to
the derivation, note that the identical distribution of the replicates allows us to assert that

Var[q,] = Var[q;] and that Cov[qy,q2] = Cov[qi, q)] for any fixed replicate i and j.

The above result extends the case in Theorem 3.4.3 by taking nonlinear estimators
into consideration. Notice that both biases are equal to the negative covariance of the
estimators of the replicate samples. Hence, the bias of the RG variance estimator is only
affected by the non-independence of the replicates, and not by whether the replicate
estimators are unbiased. In addition, the result above also holds true for estimating other
nonlinear quantities so long as the assumption of identically distributed random groups is

satisfied.

Since the bias of the simple ratio estimator is of order 1/7, it follows that the bias tends to

for any replicate i. Now, Bias(q;) have the same sign for all i since the q;s are identically

4.2 TSL vs RG Based on the LFS

Since the Labor Force Survey (LFS) adopted the MS design in April 2016, the
Philippine Statistics Authority uses the Taylor Series Linearization (TSL) in estimating the
variance of employment rate. While the TSL has its merits in estimating non-linear
estimators like employment rate, which is a ratio estimator, the RG variance estimation
procedure may be more appropriate for the MS design as it is a replicated sample. These
two variance estimation methods are already introduced in Chapter 3. Thus, this section
primarily presents a comparative analysis in the use of TSL and the RG methods in

estimating the standard errors (SE) of employment rate based on the LFS 2016 data. The

derived properties of estimators in the previous section were then evaluated if they are
consistent using the empirical data of the study.

The PSA has generously shared the data of the LFS for four quarters for the
purposes of this study. All the domain level TSL and RG standard error estimates of
employment rate for four (4) quarters/rounds of the LFS were collated for April 2016, July
2016, October 2016, and January 2017. Moreover, the subclass employment rate estimates
in each domain were examined. Since the MS design has 117 domains in total and the LFS
is gathered on a quarterly basis, 466 (117*4-2) SE estimates were considered. This
excludes the estimates from the two rounds (April 2016 and October 2016) when the

province of Batanes was not included in the sample.

Preliminary inspection of the distributions of the standard error estimates at the

domain level using RG and TSL in Figure 4.2.1 showed that the SEs using RG are more

varied than using TSL. To explore the performance of TSL and RG on the estimation of

the variable of interest, the differences of corresponding SE estimates of RG and TSL per

domain per quarter were also inspected. That is, if SE;;,xg denotes the estimated standard

error of employment rate of domain i for quarter j using RG and SEj; 7s, is its

corresponding estimate using TSL, then their difference is given as SEdiff;; = SEijrg —

Table 4.2.1 shows the distribution of the differences of the standard errors using

RG and TSL, whereas Figure 4.2.2 shows its corresponding histogram. Based on the

histogram, the SE differences are approximately normal in distribution whose mean is close

to zero. On the other hand, Table 4.2.1 shows that about 75% of the differences of the

standard error estimates are within +0.005, and about 95% of the SE estimates are within

+0.01 difference. Moreover, the TSL has higher SE for only 1.5% of the estimates by at
least 0.01, while there is at least 0.01 SE difference for about 3.22% of the estimates. From
this table, a similar conclusion can be inferred as in Figure 4.2.1, that the SE estimates are

slightly smaller using TSL than using RG.

The performances TSL and RG in estimating the standard errors of the proportion
of unpaid workers among the employed, and the employment rates of finer subclasses, the
female and the youth, were also investigated. Figure 4.2.3 is an overlay of the distribution
histograms of the SE estimates of the proportion of unpaid, and female and youth
employment rates using the RG and TSL. In terms of granularity, the subclasses can be

ordered as unpaid, female, and youth, with the last being the most granular.

Ocular inspection of the histograms above suggests that the standard error estimates
using RG get more varied as the population of interest gets more granular. This is
characterized by the less peaking and the spreading of the histograms as the subclass sizes
become smaller. On the contrary, the standard error estimates using TSL seem to get more
peaked as the population gets finer, which suggests that the SEs have less variability for
finer subclasses. However, the SEs are also more spread so no definite conclusion can be
drawn about the behaviour of the TSL SE estimates with respect to the granularity of the
subclasses based on Figure 4.2.3. Although, the prominent observation from Figure 4.2.3

is about the disparity of the variability of the SEs using RG and TSL as the population gets

finer. RG and TSL estimates seem to have the same variability in the first subclass but they
get more different in the second and third subclasses. Thus, as the population of interest
gets finer, the disparity of the SE estimates using RG and TSL becomes more prominent,
with TSL SEs seeming to consistently have less variation.

To assess the precision of RG and TSL estimates for the subclasses of interest, the
differences of the estimated SEs at these subclasses were also computed. The distribution
of the differences in SEs for the proportion of unpaid workers among the employed is
presented in Figure 4.2.4 and Table 4.2.2. It can be seen in the histogram in Figure 4.2.4
that outlying differences of SEs are present. Based on Table 4.2.2, about 60% of the
estimates have difference not more than 0.005, and almost 90% are within +0.01 bounds.
Hence, for the estimation of this variable, the SEs are generally smaller using RG compared

to TSL.

Figure 4.2.5 and Table 4.2.3 describe the distribution of the differences of the SEs
of female employment rate using RG and TSL. Based on Figure 4.2.5, there is an
observable deviation in the distribution from normality and that outlying SE differences
are also present, but larger compared to what was seen in Figure 4.2.4. Similarly, Table
4.2.3 also shows slightly more negative SE differences that are within +0.005. However,
the larger SE differences seem to numerically favour TSL. For absolute differences that
are greater than 0.005, there are more positive SE differences compared to negative ones.

Hence, for this level of estimation, TSL has arguably more precise estimates.

Finally, the last subclass of interest is the youth group. The behaviour of RG and
TSL for this level of estimation is similar to the female subclass. The histogram in Figure

4.2.6 shows that large outlying SE differences are present on both the positive and negative

sides, which strongly suggests the SEs have higher variability now that the subclass of

interest is the finest among the three.

Table 4.2.4 also shares some similarities with Table 4.2.3. Based on the table, about

80% of the SE differences are within 0.02 in width. Among these SE differences, there are

slightly more negative differences. However, the opposite is the case for SE differences
that are absolutely greater than 0.02. For larger absolute SE differences, there are more
positive differences which suggests that TSL SE estimates are smaller compared to RG SE
estimates.

In summary, the computed means and standard deviations of the SE estimates of
RG and TSL, and their corresponding differences, for all levels that the estimation was
conducted is shown in Table 4.2.5. As expected, the means of the standard deviation of the
SEs generally become larger as the population of interest gets finer, thereby supporting the
claim of the study that standard errors indeed get larger for finer subclasses. Additionally,
for all domains of estimation, the TSL SE estimates have consistently lower standard
deviation compared to RG. Hence, TSL as a variance estimation procedure provides more
robust SE estimates compared to RG. Finally, the increasing standard deviation of the SE
differences in the table below seems to contradict the variability that can be observed based
on the shapes of the histograms in Figures 4.2.2, 4.2.4, 4.2.5, and 4.2.6. Parallel to the
increasing peak of the histograms are the increasing outlying differences as the population
gets finer. Hence, in the next section, the domains where the outlying differences occurred

were inspected.

4.3 Effect of Sample Size on the

Differences of SEs

In the previous section, it was observed that as the populations of interest becomes

finer, the incidence of larger outlying differences of standard errors generally increase.

Thus, in this section, the performance of RG with respect to TSL, and vice versa, was

related to the captured size of the domain. It was also observed how their performances

were affected as the population of interest gets more granular. The sample sizes of domains

at all levels of estimation for all quarters are given in Appendices N and O. Similar to the

previous section, the sample sizes of the domains for all quarters were collated. As a

preliminary result, Table 4.3.1 below shows the frequency distribution of domains

according to sample size. At each level of estimation, five intervals were formed for the

sample sizes so that the domains can be described as very small, small, medium, large, and

very large, according to size.

Two main observations, based on Table 4.3.2, can be made about the relative
performances of RG vs. TSL in estimating the standard errors. First, for the estimation of
the subclasses, the outlying SE differences indicate that RG usually has larger SE estimates
compared to TSL. Furthermore, there is an apparent increase in the difference between the
number of positive and negative SE differences as the subclass becomes finer. In the
estimation of the proportion of unpaid workers, there are almost an equal number of
positive and negative outlying SE differences. However, for the female and youth
employment rates, the decreasing number of negative SE differences is paralleled by the

increasing number of positive SE differences.


The second major observation is the tendency of the SE differences to cluster
among the domains that are at most medium in size. This is expected since the estimation
of subclasses entails the decrease of the sample size thereby compromising the validity of
the variance estimates. Taking a closer look at the SE estimates revealed that large SE
differences as presented in Table 4.3.2 are mostly present in the domains that are either
very small or small. Specifically, for the estimation of domain level employment rate, the
largest SE differences occurred in Camiguin, Davao del Sur, and Lanao del Sur; for the
unpaid subclass, tremendous differences were observed in Apayao and Oriental Mindoro;
for the female subclass, the same were observed in Sulu, Dinagat Islands, Apayao, San
Juan City, and Camiguin; and lastly for youth employment rate, major differences were
found in Pateros, Camiguin, and Zamboanga City. Interesting enough, although some of
these domains are large on the average, the outlying SE differences occur only on the
quarters when only a small size of the subclass of interest was captured during sampling.
This highlights the importance of sample size in estimating variation. Furthermore, caution
must always be observed when conducting statistical inferences for small-sampled

domains.

CHAPTER 5

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1 Summary

Multipurpose surveys have become the norm especially in developing countries
where very limited resources are available. In the Philippines, the 2013 Master Sample
employed as a cost-efficient mechanism in integrating all household-based surveys
conducted by PSA. That is, all these household-based surveys now follow the same design
in obtaining the sample, and employ the same estimation procedure in obtaining the desired
statistics. By accommodating numerous surveys that are conducted for research purposes,
the primary function of the MS now becomes the collection of data for measuring
indicators that are essential for economic planning. However, these indicators usually
require adequate estimates for certain subclasses, which poses another problem since the
precision of the standard error estimates are now uncontrolled.

This study investigated which method of estimation, i.e., TSL or RG, is more
appropriate for subclass analysis for the 2013 MS. Based on a specific design to simplify
the 2013 MS that was discussed in Chapter 4, the following conclusions were forwarded:

1. The bias of the RG variance estimator has a bias equal to the negative covariance
of the estimators of any two fixed replicates;
Bias(vargglGre]) = —Cov(qy, q2) (Theorem 4.1.1)
From this result, it easily follows that an upper bound for the bias is the variance of the

estimator of any fixed replicate.

2. The absolute bias of the RG estimator is greater than the absolute bias of the TSL
estimator;
|Bias(Gr¢)| = |Bias(r)| (Proposition 4.1.2)
3. The variance of the RG estimator is greater than the variance of the TSL estimator,
Var(Gr¢) = Var(r) (Proposition 4.1.4)
and in consequence,
4. TSL generally performs better than RG;
MSE[Gg¢] = MSE[r]. (Theorem 4.1.5)
These theoretical properties were shown to be consistent with the results obtained
in Section 4.2 where the corresponding differences of the standard error estimates of TSL
and RG of a certain domain at a particular quarter were computed. In section 4.3, the
behaviour of the estimated SEs using both variance estimation procedures were
investigated in relation to the number of samples obtained per domain. It was observed that
greater disparity in the estimated SEs tend to occur in small-sampled domains. Moreover,
it was also observed that as the level of estimation gets lower, the disparity between RG

and TSL estimates becomes more apparent.

5.2 Recommendations

Based on the results of this study, several research opportunities can be looked into
by other researchers who are also interested in improving the master sample:
1. Strong assumptions about the replicates were made in the derivation of the

theoretical properties in Section 4.1; replicates must have equal sizes and possess

identical distributions (94,4, > 0). However, these assumptions may not be
realistic hence, properties that relax these assumptions can be more practicable.
Moreover, some other behaviour of the RG and TSL estimates with no underlying
theory were observed based on the LFS 2016 data. Thus, a generalized or extended
theory of what had been shown in this study is encouraged by the proponent;
Although a computational formula for the bias of the ratio is already given in
equation 3.2, the bias for RG and TSL were not computed due to computational
incapacities. Hence, it would provide additional evidence for or against the theory
developed in this study if the bias for both variance estimation procedures were
computed;

The computations in Section 4.2 only considered the weighted ratio in producing
domain and replicate level estimates. Although this entails very large computations,
it would be interesting to verify if the same conclusion, as to which method, i.e.,
TSL or RG, is more appropriate if bias-corrected ratio estimators that are available
in the literature are also considered; and finally

Since there is now evidence that TSL generally performs better than RG in
estimating the standard errors for the subclasses, the PSA should continue using
this procedure for this purpose. With the decreasing costs of fast computers and
statistical software package having TSL as the default variance estimation
procedure, TSL arguably has computational advantages over RG especially for
large-scale surveys. Finally, it is encouraged that data from other surveys that use

the MS design be used to verify if results are similarly consistent.
