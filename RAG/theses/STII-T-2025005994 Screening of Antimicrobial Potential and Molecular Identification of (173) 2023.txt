ABSTRACT

Emergence of antimicrobial resistance prompts the urgent need for novel
antimicrobials. Microbial secondary metabolites appear to be a promising solution
to this global problem. Among microorganisms, majority of novel antimicrobials
originated from the genus Streptomyces. Streptomyces species are filamentous
Gram-positive bacteria characterized by mycelial growth with over 70% guanine-
cytosine content in their DNA. We have previously isolated a total of 103
Streptomyces species from diverse soil habitats in Calamba City, Laguna in the
Philippines using a modified integrated approach. The isolated soil Streptomyces
were identified at the genus level using morphological and biochemical
characteristics. These isolates represent a potential and valuable pool of specimen
for antimicrobial drug discovery and development research. Therefore, this study
aimed to: (1) determine the potential antimicrobial activity of Streptomyces isolates
against selected microorganisms, (2) identify the Streptomyces isolates with
antimicrobial activity at the species level using 16S rRNA sequencing and BLAST,
and (3) determine the evolutionary relationships of the Streptomyces isolates with
antimicrobial activity using phylogenetic analysis. Out of 103 Streptomyces
isolates screened for their antimicrobial activity, nine isolates showed significant
inhibitory activity against at least two test organisms used in this study. Bacteria,
including antimicrobial resistant strains (i.e. MRSA and ESBL-E. coli), were
effectively inhibited in contrast to fungi. Species level identification and
phylogenetic analysis revealed the diversity of the bioactive Streptomyces isolates with antimicrobial capabilities. Results of this study also suggest that soil from Calamba City, Laguna, Philippines may be regarded as sustainable and rich
source of antimicrobial-producing Streptomyces. The bioactive Streptomyces
isolates may be considered as promising candidates for research and discovery of novel antimicrobials to combat antimicrobial resistance.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

1.1. Background of the study

Antimicrobials are considered as one of the most effective forms of
chemotherapy that undeniably revolutionized medicine through the significant
control and reduction of infectious diseases (Aminov, 2010; Demain, 1999; Yilmaz
& Ozcengiz, 2017; Zaffiri et al., 2012). However, antimicrobial resistance among
several human microbial pathogens continues to increase leading to antimicrobial
crisis (Aminov, 2017). In fact, recent data revealed that world is currently
experiencing an antimicrobial resistance pandemic (Murray et al., 2022).

Despite the abrupt global burden of antimicrobial resistance and the urgent
need of novel antimicrobials, especially in developing countries, there is a declining
interest from pharmaceutical companies to develop antimicrobials for a variety of
teasons including lower return on investments, more challenging search for novel
antimicrobials due to probable depletion of biological sources, and more
demanding regulatory requirements (Aminov, 2017; Bérdy, 2005; Clardy et al.,
2006; Durand et al., 2018; Laxminarayan, 2022; Lewis, 2013; Urem et al., 2016;
von Bubnoff, 2006; Yilmaz & Ozcengiz, 2017). Thus, antimicrobial resistance is
declared as a major public health problem that needs immediate and coordinated
action from both the government sector and society (Aminov, 2017; CDC, 2021;

Nicolaou & Rigol, 2018; WHO, 2021).

Natural products, defined as chemical compounds originated from various
biological sources (Baker et al., 2007; Durand et al., 2018; Krause & Tobin, 2013),
might offer solution to this global problem. The use of natural products primarily of
microbial secondary metabolites to combat infectious diseases is well-documented
(Baker et al., 2007; Durand et al., 2018; Krause & Tobin, 2013). Microbial
secondary metabolites have been successfully industrialized as antimicrobials
(Baral et al., 2018). It is believed that new metabolites can be discovered through
screening of the strains of the notable producers of chemically diverse secondary
metabolites, primarily the actinomycetes (Bérdy, 2005; Donadio et al., 2002).

Actinomycetes are well-known to be the most valuable and most prolific
sources of most of the available bioactive secondary metabolites; they produce
more than 10,000 out of 22,500 or 45% of all bioactive microbial metabolites (Baral
et al., 2018; Bérdy, 2005; Leelakrishnan & Palaniswamy, 2012; Tanaka & Omura,
1990). Moreover, 70-75% of all bioactive metabolites from actinomycetes exhibit
antimicrobial properties (Bérdy, 2005). Thus far, over 8,000 antimicrobials have
been discovered from actinomycetes (Baral et al., 2018). Amongst actinomycetes,
majority of the novel antimicrobials originated from the genus Streptomyces
(Clardy et al., 2006; Maleki et al., 2013).

Streptomyces species are _ filamentous Gram-positive bacteria
characterized by mycelial growth with over 70% guanine-cytosine (GC) content in
their DNA (Atta, 2015; Maleki et al., 2013; Urem et al., 2016). Soil is the natural
habitat of Streptomyces (Hossain & Rahman, 2014; Kizito & Nwankwo, 2013;

Lloyd, 1969; Oskay, 2009) and it is considered as a physically, biologically, and

nutritionally complex ecosystem often comprises of complex carbohydrates
(Maleki et al., 2013; Rokem et al., 2007; Urem et al., 2016). Nevertheless,
Streptomyces species can perform a wide range of metabolic processes in soil
ecosystems due to their different biosynthesis genes that allow them to produce
diverse bioactive secondary metabolites with strain-to-strain variations, which are
affected by environmental conditions such as pH and altitude levels (Baral et al.,
2018; Bérdy, 2005; Donadio et al., 2002; Lloyd, 1969; Maleki et al., 2013; Oskay,
2009; Shibavai & Gutte, 2019; Tyc et al., 2017). Out of the over 10,000 bioactive
microbial metabolites isolated from actinomycetes, 8,700 or 86% originated from
Streptomyces (Baral et al., 2018; Bérdy, 2005; Clardy et al., 2006; Leelakrishnan
& Palaniswamy, 2012). Therefore, Streptomyces species are considered as
industrially and economically important microorganisms due to their nearly
inexhaustible ability to produce numerous novel bioactive secondary metabolites
(Atta, 2015; Fguira et al., 2012; Hossain & Rahman, 2014; Kizito & Nwankwo,
2013; Taddei et al., 2006; Urem et al., 2016; Watve et al., 2001).

Numerous researchers suggested that the genus Streptomyces plays an
important role in the discovery of new antimicrobials (i.e., intensive screening of
the genus Streptomyces will result to approximately 15-20 new antimicrobials)
(Clardy et al., 2006). Likewise, studies estimated that the genus Streptomyces
could produce approximately 150,000 chemically diverse antimicrobial agents
(Baral et al., 2018; Watve et al., 2001). Since only 1-3% of all antimicrobials from

Streptomyces have been discovered, 97-99% are still yet to be discovered (Bérdy,

2005; Clardy et al., 2006; Velho-Pereira & Kamat, 2011). Therefore, extensive
screening is warranted.

In the Philippines, there is a rich amount of evidence demonstrating the
existence of Streptomyces from soil habitats and the antimicrobial-producing
ability of the isolated strains. Several antimicrobials have been discovered from
the different Streptomyces strains isolated from the Philippine soil such as
erythromycin (ilotycin) (McGuire et al., 1952), filipin (Whitfield et al., 1955),
roseoflavin (Otani et al., 1974), inosamycin (Tsunakawa et al., 1985), boholmycin
(Saitoh et al., 1988), and lagunamycin (Nihei et al.,1993). However, local studies
are looking into the isolation of Streptomyces from other habitats such as marine
environment (Azcuna et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2010, 2014; Paderog et al., 2020;
Parungao et al., 2007; Sabido et al., 2020, 2021; Tenebro et al., 2021; Verdera et
al., 2021) and the agricultural application of the compounds derived from different
strains of Streptomyces (Cruz et al., 2015; Custodio & Alcantara, 2019; Suralta et
al., 2019). Therefore, local studies with regards to discovering new antimicrobials
from soil Streptomyces are insufficient.

In our previous study, we isolated a total of 103 Streptomyces from diverse
soil habitats in Calamba City, Laguna in the Philippines using a modified integrated
approach (Antido & Climacosa, 2022). However, using morphological and
biochemical characteristics, the isolates were successfully characterized up to the
genus level only. Therefore, investigation of potential antimicrobial ability and
species level identification of these Streptomyces isolates are needed to assess

potential for discovery of novel, potent, and safe antimicrobials.

1.2. Statement of the problem

Antimicrobial resistance pandemic is a major public health problem that
needs an immediate and coordinated solution. Discovery of novel antimicrobials is
a key point strategy for combatting antimicrobial resistance. It is hypothesized that
new antimicrobials can be discovered through screening of notable producers of
several secondary metabolites, notably the genus Streptomyces. Studies suggest
that there is still a huge untapped potential from these microorganisms. We
successfully isolated a total of 103 soil Streptomyces from Calamba City, Laguna,
Philippines (Antido & Climacosa, 2022). In this study, the potential antimicrobial
activity of these Streptomyces isolates were investigated and the isolates with

antimicrobial activity were identified at species level using molecular techniques.

1.3. Objectives of the study
1.3.1. General objective
This study generally aimed to characterize the 103 soil Streptomyces

isolated from Calamba City, Laguna, Philippines.

1.3.2. Specific objectives
A. To determine the potential antimicrobial activity of Streptomyces isolates
against selected microorganisms (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus
subtilis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], Escherichia
coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-
Producing Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus,

Trichophyton rubrum)

B. To identify the Streptomyces isolates with antimicrobial activity at the
species level using 16S rRNA sequencing and Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool (BLAST)

C. To determine the evolutionary relationships of the Streptomyces isolates

with antimicrobial activity using phylogenetic analysis

1.4. Significance of the study

The use of microbial secondary metabolites to combat infectious diseases
resulted to an increase in life expectancy since the 20" century (Demain, 1999;
Matsumoto & Takahashi, 2017). This led to an observable exponential increase in
studies about natural products and metabolites discovery (Bérdy, 2005) until the
1980s when linezolid and daptomycin were discovered (Aminov, 2017; Durand et
al., 2018). Combinational chemistry made it possible to develop new
antimicrobials, but these are analogues of existing compounds (Bérdy, 2005;
Durand et al., 2018). In fact, the quantity of novel antimicrobials is roughly 60%
lower than in the mid-1980s (von Bubnoff, 2006). Moreover, the scarcity of
initiatives for novel antimicrobial discovery is complicated by the public health
problem of increasing antimicrobial resistance. Hence, research on drug discovery
and development is demanded (IDSA, 2010).

Actinomycetes offer an appealing source of bioactive secondary
metabolites as previously reported (Baral et al., 2018; Bérdy, 2005; Clardy et al.,
2006; Leelakrishnan & Palaniswamy, 2012; Maleki et al., 2013; Tanaka & Omura,

1990). Among actinomycetes, majority of the novel antimicrobials originated from

the genus Streptomyces (Baral et al., 2018; Bérdy, 2005; Clardy et al., 2006;
Leelakrishnan & Palaniswamy, 2012).

In the Philippines, although previous studies revealed that several
antimicrobials have been discovered from soil Streptomyces (McGuire et al., 1952;
Nihei et al., 1993; Otani et al., 1974; Saitoh et al., 1988; Tsunakawa et al., 1985;
Whitfield et al., 1955), local studies are more concentrated on the isolation of
Streptomyces from other habitats (e.g., marine environment) (Azcuna et al., 2011;
Lin et al., 2010, 2014; Paderog et al., 2020; Parungao et al., 2007; Sabido et al.,
2020, 2021; Tenebro et al., 2021; Verdera et al, 2021) and the agricultural
application of the compounds from different strains of Streptomyces (Cruz et al.,
2015; Custodio & Alcantara, 2019; Suralta et al., 2019). In fact, only few local
studies are directly involved in the discovery of new antimicrobials from
Streptomyces in soil habitats (Oliveros et al., 2021; Sevilla-Santos & De Leon,
1962; Zhou et al., 2019). Therefore, local studies with regards to discovering new

antimicrobials from soil Streptomyces are insufficient.

CHAPTER II

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

2.1. Antimicrobials and the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance

Antimicrobials are considered as one of the most effective forms of
chemotherapy in the history of medicine (Aminov, 2010). The discovery and
development of antimicrobials such as penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and
other natural, synthetic, and semi-synthetic antimicrobials undeniably
tevolutionized medicine through meaningful control and reduction of human
morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases (Demain, 1999; Yilmaz &
Ozcengiz, 2017; Zaffiri et al., 2012). Similarly, morbidity and mortality due to
infectious diseases cause less burden compared to non-infectious diseases.
However, as a result of the disturbingly increasing antimicrobial resistance among
several human microbial pathogens, we are presently experiencing a global
antimicrobial crisis (Aminov, 2017).

Antimicrobial resistance compromises the treatment and prevention of an
ever-increasing array of infections (WHO, 2021) caused by continuously evolving
microbial strains due to our inability to eradicate or prevent them from spreading
(Nicolaou & Rigol, 2018). Of particular concer is the rise of drug-resistant bacterial
strains referred to as ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus
aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species), especially on developing countries

(Aminov, 2017; IDSA, 2010; Laxminarayan, 2022; Murray et al., 2022: Nicolaou &

Rigol, 2018). According to a systematic analysis study, approximately 4.95 million
deaths were associated to antimicrobial resistance in 2019, making it the leading
cause of death worldwide. Researchers also estimated that antimicrobial
resistance may lead to death of 10 million people per year by 2050 (Murray et al.,
2022). Thus, antimicrobial resistance is declared as a major public health concern,
which requires action amongst all government sectors and the society (CDC, 2021;
Leelakrishnan & Palaniswamy, 2012; Murray et al., 2022; WHO, 2021).

The emergence of antimicrobial resistance can be primarily attributed to a
combination of inappropriate and overuse of antimicrobial and insufficient access
(Laxminarayan, 2022; Yilmaz & Ozcengiz, 2017). Likewise, upon the discovery of
growth promoting properties of antimicrobials, there is an abrupt increase of
antimicrobial feed additives for animals leading to global dissemination of
resistance to certain antimicrobials (Aminov, 2017). Furthermore, pharmaceutical
companies favored the use of rational drug design and combinational chemistry to
make drugs to be non-toxic, well-absorbed and active against certain target;
however, these strategies neither resulted to the discovery of new antimicrobial
agents nor resolve antimicrobial resistance but expands the array of antimicrobial
resistance instead (Bérdy, 2005; Durand et al., 2018; von Bubnoff, 2006; Watve et
al., 2001; Yilmaz & Ozcengiz, 2017).

Despite the abrupt global emergence of antimicrobial resistance and the
urgent need of novel antimicrobials, there is a declining interest from
pharmaceutical companies in developing antimicrobials for a variety of reasons

(Aminov, 2017; Baker et al., 2007; Laxminarayan, 2022; Watve et al., 2001; Yilmaz

& Ozcengiz, 2017). Because antibiotics are only consumed for a short period of
time, pharmaceutical companies preferred the manufacture of drugs against
lifelong diseases due to higher “return on investments” (Lewis, 2013; von Bubnoff,
2006; Yilmaz & Ozcengiz, 2017). In addition, although there is an increase in the
number of antimicrobials being discovered, the number of antimicrobials being
approved is decreasing or insufficient because regulatory requirements are
becoming more demanding (Durand et al., 2018; Yilmaz & Ozcengiz, 2017).
Similarly, biological sources might have been exhausted that makes the search for
novel antimicrobials more challenging (Clardy et al., 2006; Durand et al., 2018;
Urem et al., 2016; von Bubnoff, 2006; Watve et al., 2001).

As a means to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, World
Health Organization (WHO) urgently demands governments worldwide for
continuous development in the prevention of infectious diseases and stringent
enforcements of good practices in the application of currently available and to be
discovered antimicrobials. They highlighted the significance of supporting research
focused on the discovery and development of novel antimicrobial agents to the
current generation of resistant microbial pathogens (Clardy et al., 2006; Nicolaou
& Rigol, 2018). To halt the problems caused by antimicrobial resistance, it is
tecommended to: (1) implement better hygiene practices in hospitals and clinics,
(2) stop prescribing antibiotics for viral diseases prior to proper diagnosis, (3) stop
the practice of using antibiotics as growth hormones in animals, and (4) provide
incentives to industry and academia to encourage innovation to discover and

develop novel antimicrobials (Aminov, 2017; Nicolaou & Rigol, 2018).

10

In conclusion, the research for novel microbial metabolites is a key point
amongst the strategies for combatting antimicrobial resistance (Durand et al.,
2018). Due to the problem of increasing resistance to antimicrobials leading to
economic and clinical burden, there is an urgent need for the continued discovery
and development of novel antimicrobials (Bérdy, 2005; Gould, 2016;
Leelakrishnan & Palaniswamy, 2012; Lewis, 2013; Watve et al., 2001; Yilmaz &
Ozcengiz, 2017). Therefore, the pressing challenge is how to discover more
mechanistically and chemically novel agents to fulfill the needs of human therapy
(Bérdy, 2005). Likewise, extra efforts are needed to preserve and regulate the

existing antimicrobials (Gould, 2016).

2.2. Natural products as sources of novel antimicrobial compounds
Natural products in essence are chemical compounds originated from
various biological sources (e.g., microorganisms, animals, plants) (Baker et al.,
2007; Durand et al., 2018; Krause & Tobin, 2013). The use of bioactive secondary
metabolites from microbial sources minimizes suffering and pain that resulted to
an increase in the life expectancy during the 20'" century (Baker et al., 2007;
Demain, 1999; Matsumoto & Takahashi, 2017). Thus, through the succeeding
years, there is an observable exponential increase in the studies concerning
natural product and metabolites discovery (Bérdy, 2005). The current growing
interest on natural product research is motivated by their usefulness as
biochemical probes and their notable diversity of activities and structures (Demain,

1999).

11

The search for bioactive microbial metabolites and novel antimicrobials for
potential pharmaceutical, industrial, and agricultural applications is still important
(Hayakawa, 2008). Antimicrobial research in the past extensively focused on the
discovery of new antimicrobials, their structure, therapeutic properties,
biosynthesis, and mechanism of action (Gottlieb, 1976). Alexander Fleming's
identification of penicillin is considered as the foundation of drug discovery in the
history of the “Golden Era” of antimicrobial discovery (Yilmaz & Ozcengiz, 2017).
Notably, Paul Ehrlich and his colleagues had established a systematic screening
approach for antimicrobial discovery long before penicillin was introduced (Gould,
2016; Yilmaz & Ozcengiz, 2017). Hence, discovery and development of other
antimicrobials such as streptomycin, cephalosporins, and other natural, synthetic,
and semi-synthetic antimicrobials ensued (Baker et al., 2007; Yilmaz & Ozcengiz,
2017).

According to the Bérdy‘s Bioactive MlCrobial Metabolite Database, out of
the 60,000 to 80,000 natural metabolites produced by microorganisms, 47%
exhibit bioactivity such as antimicrobial and antitumor properties (Yilmaz &
Ozcengiz, 2017). Most of the antibiotics were discovered during the golden age of
antibiotic discovery (Aminov, 2017; Durand et al., 2018). Moreover, it should be
highlighted that there is no new class of antibiotics discovered since linezolid and
daptomycin in the 1980s (Durand et al., 2018). Although there is an increase in the
number of new compounds as a result of combinational chemistry, these
compounds were just analogues of existing compound (Bérdy, 2005; Durand et

al., 2018; Krause & Tobin; 2013). Moreover, deforestation, environmental

12

pollution, and climate change are the threats impacting the gradual deterioration
of sources of natural products (Krause & Tobin, 2013). Likewise, discovery
research regarding soil-dwelling microorganisms capable of producing bioactive
compounds have been diminishing continuously (Matsumoto & Takahashi, 2017).
Thus, new strategies are warranted (Baker et al., 2007; Durand et al., 2018;
Krause & Tobin, 2013) and programs that will ensure the protection of the sources

of natural products should be implemented (Krause & Tobin, 2013).

2.3. Secondary metabolites production and the effect of nutrition

Isolation of bioactive microbial metabolites in the laboratory frequently
involves the identification of small amount of compounds that are produced as a
result of the introduction of the antimicrobial-producing microorganism in a foreign
environment (Davies, 2006). Generally, these metabolites are natural products
mainly derived from the primary and secondary metabolism of the producing
microorganisms. These may be utilized as raw materials for succeeding
microbiological and chemical modification, used in the rational drug design (RDD)
studies as templates or primary components for chemical synthesis of new
analogues, and applied for clinical use (Bérdy, 2005).

Primary and secondary metabolism are thought to be regulated in different
ways; however, these metabolic reactions are closely linked in terms of nutrient
regulation and precursor supply (Rokem et al., 2007). Primary metabolites such as
proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic and fatty acids, are needed for the growth

and maintenance of cellular functions and are similar across all biological systems

13

(Bérdy, 2005; Goodfellow et al., 2012). On the other hand, secondary metabolites
(e.g., antimicrobials) are the end products of primary metabolism that are
exceptionally diverse molecules yielded by the evolutionary process; these
products are not exactly involved in the growth, development or reproduction of
microorganisms but still may play vital ecological roles in the interactions of intra-
and interspecific microorganisms in their habitats (Bérdy, 2005; Goodfellow et al.,
2012; Law et al., 2018; Rokem et al., 2007; Tyc et al., 2017). However, the ability
to produce secondary metabolites is confined to distinct group of organisms such
as eukaryotic fungi, unicellular bacteria, and filamentous actinomycetes. Amongst
eukaryotic fungi, a total of 8,600 or 38% of all bioactive metabolites can be isolated;
the most significant fungi capable of producing secondary metabolites are
endophytic fungi, ascomycetes, and other filamentous fungi. Likewise, a total of
roughly 3,800 or 17% of all microbial metabolites can be isolated from unicellular
bacteria with Pseudomonas species and Bacillus species being the most common
producers. Furthermore, Actinobacteria, considered as the chief producers of
bioactive microbial metabolites, can produce over 10,000 bioactive compound or
45% of all microbial metabolites (Baral et al., 2018; Bérdy, 2005; Demain, 1999;
Donadio et al., 2002).

Secondary metabolites stem from a limited well-defined class of
compounds through biosynthetic pathways. Nevertheless, due to evolutionary
processes and variations in tailoring phases, building blocks, and enzymatic
mechanisms, an enormously diverse range of chemical structures are formed

(Bérdy, 2005; Rokem et al., 2007; Tyc et al., 2017). In bacteria, secondary

14

metabolites production is affected by different environmental factors, which
includes temperature, moisture, pH, light, and nutrients. Frequently, secondary
metabolites production is stimulated due to limited bacterial growth as a result of
depletion of nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphate, and other vital nutrient
sources (Hasani et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016; Tyc et al., 2017).

Carbon and nitrogen source utilization can vary among different
Streptomyces (Goodfellow et al., 2012; Shirling & Gottlieb, 1966). Commonly used
sources of carbon include glycerol, glucose, mannose, trehalose, and cellobiose
while commonly used nitrogen sources include nitrate, ammonium, L-asparagine,
and L-arginine (Goodfellow et al., 2012). Glucose is the ideal source of carbon in
fermentation industry because of its high availability and low cost. Moreover,
because glucose can easily be assimilated by most microorganisms, there will be
an increase in the by-products of glucose metabolism that influences the increase
in production of secondary metabolites as a result of rapid growth (Rokem et al.,
2007). In soil, the usefulness of glucose as source of carbon for growth and
antimicrobial production is being suppressed due to the existence of carbon
catabolite repression in several microorganisms (Rokem et al., 2007; Urem et al.,
2016). Nevertheless, for actinomycetes, polysaccharides such as glycerol and
starch are the most appropriate carbon sources for antimicrobial production since
they support slow growth rate these bacteria prefer (Hasani et al., 2014).

The selection of source of nitrogen in culture media is also vital in the
production of antimicrobials by actinomycetes. Simple and inorganic sources of

nitrogen typically decrease antimicrobial production whereas complex sources of

15

nitrogen sources such as yeast extract, soybean meal, and casein increase
antimicrobial production because of slow breakdown of these compounds that is
needed for slow growth of actinomycetes (Hasani et al., 2014). In Streptomyces
species, the control of the metabolism of nitrogen is more complex and function
contrary to other well-studied bacteria (Oskay 2009; Rokem et al., 2007).

Moreover, antimicrobial-producing microorganisms are affected by
phosphate concentration. Generally, a low phosphate concentration is essential
for the onset of antimicrobial production. The effect of phosphate differs on the
class of compounds (i.e., macrolides and glycopeptides can be inhibited by high
concentrations of phosphate in the growth medium) (Hasani et al., 2014; Oskay,
2009; Rokem et al., 2007).

Similarly, oxygen concentration, microbial growth rate, and environmental
PH affects antimicrobial production. Since actinomycetes are aerobic bacteria,
presence of oxygen greatly influences their growth rate and antimicrobial
production. Several antimicrobials are also optimally produced in pH levels near to
neutrality. Lastly, production of secondary metabolites is found to be higher during
nutrient limitations than non-limiting nutrient conditions (Hasani et al., 2014; Li et

al., 2016).

2.4. Soil: An extensively used ecological niche in the discovery of
antimicrobial-producing microorganisms
Several habitats have been screened for microorganisms with antimicrobial

capabilities (Gould, 2016). However, most of the antimicrobials discovered were

16

isolated from soil-living microorganisms, with fungi and bacteria being the chief
producers (Durand et al., 2018). Furthermore, most of the novel antimicrobials are
detected though screening of wild isolates of novel soil microorganisms (Gould,
2016; Williams & Vickers, 1986). Antimicrobials assist the producer
microorganisms survive in the highly competitive soil habitats (Lee et al., 2020;
Williams & Vickers, 1986).

A critical factor in drug discovery is the isolation of unique and diverse
groups of microorganisms with the ability to generate secondary metabolites
(Donadio et al., 2002). The evidence that most of the microorganisms capable of
producing antimicrobials originated from soil and are largely undiscovered,
encouraged researchers to thoroughly screen and explore the sources of
antimicrobial metabolites in terms of their dimension, ecological, environmental,
and geographic relevance since the 20" century (Bérdy, 2005; Gottlieb, 1976; von
Bubnoff, 2006; Williams & Vickers, 1986). Usual soil samples for the isolation of
producers includes farm soil and garden soil because these environments are
easier to access (Takahashi & Omura, 2003). Generally, the ocean and to a lesser
extent the forests are considered as almost inexhaustible, unexplored reservoirs
of novel compounds (Bérdy, 2005; von Bubnoff, 2006). However, studying
complex habitats is challenging, thus a rational approach is studying simple and
less complicated microbial habitats (Clardy et al., 2009). However, studying simple
and less complicated microbial habitats is also problematic since sampling the
same ecosystems only resulted to repeated discovery of known antimicrobials (von

Bubnoff, 2006; Wadetwar & Patil, 2013; Watve et al., 2001).

17

Despite the discovery of many new antimicrobial compounds, there were
fewer new type of structures being discovered as compared to the previous
decades (Bérdy, 2005). In addition, several soil bacteria are still unculturable.
Therefore, there is a need to develop new approaches to culture these bioactive

soil bacteria (von Bubnoff, 2006).

2.5. Actinobacteria: Inexhaustible source of bioactive natural products

It is hypothesized that new metabolites can be discovered through
screening of filamentous actinomycetes for chemically diverse secondary
metabolites (Bérdy, 2005; Donadio et al., 2002). Actinobacteria are previously
classified as fungi due to their ability to produce mycelia and reproduce via
sporulation, but this resemblance to fungi is just superficial (Barka et al., 2016).
Therefore, Actinobacteria are reclassified as bacteria because their whole cell
structure corresponds to classic prokaryotes (i.e., cytoplasm with genomic DNA
regions) and completely different from fungi (Barka et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016).
Another defining characteristic is the susceptibility of Actinobacteria to antibacterial
agents (Barka et al., 2016).

Most actinomycetes are saprophytic, spore-forming, free-living bacteria
mostly found in soil habitats (George et al., 2012). They are established to be the
most valuable prokaryote and most prolific sources of most of the available
bioactive secondary metabolites, producing over 10,000 out of 22,500 or 45% of
all bioactive microbial metabolites (Baral et al., 2018; Bérdy, 2005; Leelakrishnan

& Palaniswamy, 2012; Tanaka & Omura, 1990). Moreover, 70-75% of all bioactive

18

metabolites from actinomycetes exhibit antimicrobial properties (Bérdy, 2005).
Thus far, over 8,000 antimicrobials have been discovered from actinomycetes
(Baral et al., 2018; Bérdy, 2005;); more than 70% of which are derived from
Streptomyces. The genus Micromonospora is the second most common source
but only accounts for fewer than one-tenth as plenty as Streptomyces (George et
al., 2012). The remarkable number of bioactive molecules discovered from
actinomycetes indicates their historical significance in the discovery of
antimicrobials. It is estimated that in every 10,000 strains of actinomycetes, 2,500
are antimicrobial producers. Additionally, estimates show that only a small portion
of earth’s soil surface has been screened for actinomycetes (Clardy et al., 2006).
Thus, the discovery of novel antimicrobials can be attained through searching for
new microorganisms from unusual and unexplored habitats (Tanaka & Omura,
1990).

Actinomycetes have the greatest percentage of cultured members, which
reflects their relative ease of culturing (Clardy et al., 2006; Donadio et al., 2002).
Aside from being good producers of bioactive secondary metabolites,
actinomycetes are also exceptional producers of enzymes with industrial
importance such as chitinase, protease, and glucose isomerase (Oskay, 2009;
Tanaka & Omura, 1990). Surprisingly, there has been an observable decline in
research regarding the previously thoroughly studied actinomycetes. In fact, the
share of actinomycetes in all microbial products being discovered is currently only
30-50% in comparison to their 75-80% share during the 1960s to 1980s. Despite

the declining interest in actinomycetes, the largest portion of the currently available

19

bioactive microbial metabolites were still discovered from several species of
actinomycetes (Bérdy, 2005; Matsumoto & Takahashi, 2017). Other antimicrobial
discovery research studies are exploring the isolation of rare actinobacteria, but
the difficulty of their isolation and little information on their genetics and physiology

pose a limitation (Bérdy, 2005; Donadio et al., 2002).

2.6. Streptomycetaceae: The valuable family of antimicrobial-producing

microorganisms

The family Streptomycetaceae belongs to phylum Actinobacteria, class
Actinobacteria, and order Streptomycetales that includes three genera namely
Streptomyces, Kitasatospora, and Streptacidiphilus. However, both Kitasatospora
and Streptacidiphilus possess high genome sequence similarity to Streptomyces,
therefore the status of these genera is still in question and are classified as genera
incertae sedis or uncertain placement. Currently, Streptomyces is the only genus

in the family Streptomycetaceae (Goodfellow et al., 2012).

2.6.1. Streptomyces: General characteristics and ecology

Streptomyces species are nonmotile, spore-forming, Gram-positive,
filamentous, obligate aerobic bacteria that belongs to the family
Streptomycetaceae. They are characterized by mycelial growth with more than
70% guanine-cytosine (GC) content in their DNA, which suggest the complexity of

both their life cycle and quickly changing environmental conditions leading to

20

mutation pressure (Atta, 2015; Goodfellow et al., 2012; Maleki et al., 2013; Muto
& Osawa, 1987; Urem et al., 2016).

Streptomyces are considered as Biosafety Level 1 (BSL 1) organisms and
are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) organisms. Likewise, Streptomyces are
not known to constantly cause disease to a healthy human and are least potential
hazard to laboratory staffs as well as to the environment (Shepherd et al., 2010).

Streptomyces are widespread in soil and comprise the major portion of the
total population of actinomycetes (Hayakawa, 2008; Matsumoto & Takahashi,
2017); their predominance and distribution depends on the chemical nature of the
soil particularly the nutrient availability, soil type, temperature, pH, moisture, and
climate (Oskay, 2009). Even though soil habitats are complex ecosystems,
Streptomyces species are capable of performing a wide range of metabolic
processes due to their biosynthesis genes (i.e., coding for the polysaccharide
hydrolases such as amylases that are needed for the degradation of complex
carbohydrate) and an extensive transport and sensing systems that monitor their
environment’s nutritional status and aid in scavenging nutritional sources and
produce bioactive secondary metabolites with strain-to-strain variations
(Goodfellow et al., 2012; Rokem et al., 2007; Urem et al., 2016) controlled by
pathway regulatory cascades with evolutionary conserved components referred to
as Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins (SARPs) (Baral et al., 2018;

Donadio et al., 2002; Tyc et al., 2017).

21

2.6.2. Streptomyces and antimicrobial production

At the start of antimicrobial era, bacterial and fungal species were the center
of interest; but after the discovery of tetracyclines, macrolides, and streptomycin,
attention was directed to the Streptomyces species (Bérdy, 2005). Due to their
ability to produce numerous novel secondary metabolites, Streptomyces species
are considered as industrially and economically important microorganisms that
produce mostly of the antimicrobials presently used in human medicine (Atta,
2015; Basilio et al., 2003; Fguira et al., 2012; Hossain & Rahman, 2014; Kizito &
Nwankwo, 2013; Taddei et al., 2006; Urem et al., 2016; Watve et al., 2001).
Because of this ability, Streptomyces serves as model system for antimicrobial
production among bacteria (Barka et al., 2016).

Out of 10,100 bioactive microbial metabolites isolated from actinomycetes,
8,700 or 86% originated from Streptomyces species (Baral et al., 2018; Berdy,
2005; Clardy et al., 2006; Leelakrishnan & Palaniswamy, 2012). Table 2.1 depicts
some of the antimicrobials derived from various Streptomyces strains. DNA
analysis methods demonstrated that the number of bioactive microbial metabolites
from Streptomyces species may be far from what this species can actually produce
(Baral et al., 2018; Bérdy, 2005). If Streptomyces were screened as intensively as
they had been in the 20" century, approximately 15 to 20 novel antimicrobials
would be discovered yearly for the next 50 years (Clardy et al., 2006). Through
computational predictions, it is estimated that Streptomyces species may have the
ability to produce 150,000 chemically distinct antimicrobial agents (Baral et al.,

2018; Watve et al., 2001). Since only 1-3% of all antimicrobials from Streptomyces

22

species have been discovered, there remains 97-99% yet to be discovered
(Bérdy, 2005; Clardy et al., 2006; Velho-Pereira & Kamat, 2011). Therefore,

intensive screening is warranted.

2.7. Methods for screening of antimicrobial potential of bioactive
microorganisms
Table 2.2 summarizes the different laboratory techniques for screening of
antimicrobial activity of potentially bioactive microorganisms. Most common
techniques for antimicrobial activity screening includes diffusion and agar or broth

dilution techniques (Balouiri et al., 2016).

Other Method Flow cytofluorometric techniques

One of the routinely used antimicrobial screening tests are diffusion
methods (Figure 2.1), which includes agar disk diffusion, agar well diffusion, agar
plug diffusion, and cross-streak techniques. Agar disk diffusion (Figure 2.1A)
utilizes agar plates inoculated with test organisms. Filter paper disks with test
compounds are placed on agar surface and diffusion of the antimicrobial agent in
the agar leads to inhibition of susceptible test organisms visualized as inhibition
zones. Similarly, agar well diffusion (Figure 2.1B) uses agar plates inoculated with
test organism on entire agar surface; 6-8 mm in diameter holes are aseptically
punched using a sterile cork borer where the antimicrobial agents or extracts under
investigation are placed. Diffusion of the antimicrobial agents or extracts in the
culture medium results to inhibition of susceptible test organism observed as zone
of inhibition. Likewise, agar plug diffusion (Figure 2.1C) involves inoculation of
strains of interest on agar plate surface, which then release secondary metabolites
that diffuse in the agar medium. Agar plug with the secondary metabolites is
aseptically cut using a cork borer and placed on the surface of another agar plate

inoculated with the test organism. The metabolites from the agar plug diffuse to

the culture medium leading to zone of inhibition around the agar plug (Balouiri et
al., 2016). Lastly, cross-streak or perpendicular streak technique (Figure 2.1D) is
employed to rapidly and preliminary investigate the antimicrobial activity of
microorganisms, which is conducted by single streak inoculation of strain of
interest in the center of culture media. Plates are then inoculated with single streak
of different test organisms perpendicular to the central/master streak. Antimicrobial
interactions or diffusion of the secondary metabolites secreted by the strain of
interest leads to observable zones of inhibition (Balouiri et al., 2016; Carvajal,
1947; Velho-Pereira & Kamat, 2011). These diffusion techniques however are not
suitable for the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) since
quantification of the antimicrobial agents that diffused into the culture media is not
possible. Still, these diffusion techniques are more advantageous than other
techniques since they are reproducible, cost-effective (i.e., numerous
microorganisms can be tested simultaneously and does not need expensive
equipment), and results are easy to interpret. In addition, when performed in
accordance to standardized techniques such as those recommended by the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), it gives accurate guidance on
screening potentially bioactive microorganisms (Balouiri et al., 2016; Jenkins &

Schuetz, 2012).

On the other hand, dilution techniques are suitable for the determination of
MICs since they can estimate the amount of antimicrobial agents in the agar or
broth media. Both the agar and broth dilution techniques can be used to
quantitatively measure the in vitro antimicrobial activity of strains of interest against
test organisms. However, as compared to the diffusion techniques, dilution
techniques are more labor-intensive and more expensive (Balouiri et al., 2016).

Lastly, flow cytofluorometric techniques may also be used to determine the
antimicrobial ability of microorganisms. Unlike diffusion and dilution techniques,
flow cytofluorometric techniques provide information about the inhibitory effects
(i.e., bacteriostatic or bactericidal) of the microorganisms of interest against the
test microorganisms. However, flow cytofluorometric techniques are not widely

utilized since they are cost-ineffective and require special instrumentation.

26

Moreover, even though they can provide rapid results of the effects of the
secondary metabolites produced by the microorganisms, further evaluations of

standardization and reproducibility are needed (Balouiri et al., 2016).

2.8. Test organisms used on screening the antimicrobial potential of

Streptomyces species using cross-streak technique

Test organisms proven to be useful in searching for microorganisms with
antimicrobial activity includes important human pathogenic microorganisms such
as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, Aspergillus species, Trichophyton rubrum, and _ Penicillium
chrysogenum. These test organisms are used on antagonistic studies for
identification of antimicrobial property of potential producer strains since they can
easily grow on culture media (Atta, 2015; Carvajal, 1947; Hewitt, 2012; Oskay,
2009; Sapkota et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2016). Screening for antimicrobial activity
studies of Streptomyces isolates against these test organisms can be performed
using diffusion methods such as cross-streak technique. Briefly, a single streak of
isolates for screening of antimicrobial activity is inoculated in the center of the
culture media and incubated at 28-30 °C for seven days, which allows any
bioactive Streptomyces species to release antimicrobial substances that will
diffuse to the agar medium. Plates with isolate of interest are then seeded with
pure culture of test organisms through a single streak perpendicular or at a 90°

angle to the strain of interest. Ruled paper that acts as a template may also be

27

used to facilitate streaking. Plates may be incubated at room temperature or 37 °C
for 24 hours for bacterial test organisms and 48 hours for fungal test organisms.
Afterwards, antagonistic activity between the strain of interest and test organisms
are then analyzed through measuring the zones of inhibition in millimeter (i-e.,
Streptomyces strains with antimicrobial activity inhibit the test organism/s resulting
to varying degrees of clearing, while inactive strains allow the test organism/s to
grow all the way toward the master streak) (Balouiri et al., 2016; Carvajal, 1947;
Jenkins & Schuetz, 2012; Sapkota et al., 2020; Singh, et al., 2016; Velho-Pereira
& Kamat, 2011).

However, it should be noted that test organisms and isolates of interest
should be cultured under optimal conditions (i.e., proper pH of culture media,
incubation time, and incubation temperature) (Atta, 2015; Carvajal, 1947; Hewitt,
2012; Oskay, 2009; Sapkota et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2016). Among the currently
available culture media, Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) medium is considered to be
the best medium for antimicrobial activity screening since it contains small amount
of substances that can inhibit the test organisms and the strains of interest,
therefore leading to satisfactory growth of test organisms and isolates of interest
(Lalitha, 2004). Moreover, density of inoculum to streak on MHA should be
appropriate to obtain accurate results. To standardize the inoculum density for
screening of antimicrobial activity, inoculum preparations should be equivalent to
the 0.5 McFarland standard or 1.5 x 108 CFU/ml (Balouiri et al., 2016; Hewitt, 2012;
Lalitha, 2004; Sapkota et al., 2020). Plates should also be incubated based on the

optimum incubation temperature of the organisms since deviation from this will

28

lead to inaccurate growth of organisms and inaccurate inhibition zones (Hewitt,
2012). Similarly, pH of the culture medium should be near to neutrality since
antimicrobials such as macrolides and aminoglycosides produced by isolates of
interest will lose their potency when deviated (Lalitha, 2004). Likewise, tests should
be performed at least in duplicate and mean values should be considered to obtain
more accurate results (Hewitt, 2012; Singh et al., 2016). In addition, test controls
should be used to ensure validity of the screening test. Antimicrobial-producing
microorganisms or filter paper impregnated with antimicrobials such as
antibacterial (e.g., erythromycin, ciprofloxacin) and antifungal (e.g., amphotericin
B, fluconazole) agents may be used as positive controls, and organisms with no
known antimicrobial-producing ability and plates without the isolate of interest may
be used as negative control to observe the normal growth of test organisms (Kohn,

1953; Salim et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2016; Wheat, 2001).

2.9. Molecular identification of Streptomyces

Approaches for Streptomyces characterization have progressed over time.
(Labeda et al., 2012; Law et al., 2018). This includes molecular methods to
establish the relatedness of higher taxa. Phylogenetic analysis using amplification
methods and comparative analysis of the highly conserved phylogenetic marker
16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) provides framework for classification (Donadio et al.,
2002; Goodfellow et al., 2012; Taddei et al., 2006). Similarly, new species of
Streptomyces or other organisms cannot be declared without genetic analysis

based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Barka et al., 2016).

29

Current advancement in genetics and molecular biology significantly
increased the available evolutionary information for Streptomyces classification
(Anderson & Wellington, 2001; Kataoka et al., 1997). Modern characterization and
identification techniques provided insights about the evolutionary relationship of
different Streptomyces strains (Anderson & Wellington, 2001). These relies on
genomic marker analysis (e.g., PCR and DNA sequencing) to evaluate gene
sequences (Kataoka et al., 1997; Law et al., 2018; Varadi et al., 2017).

The development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) resulted to the
deeper understanding of the phylogenetic relationships and evolution of
Streptomyces species (Law et al., 2018). The PCR amplification process
specifically amplify genetic materials to identify microorganisms at genus or even
at species level (Franco-Duarte et al., 2019; Law et al., 2018; Varadi et al., 2017).
Therefore, several studies have been employing PCR for identification and
characterization of Streptomyces species through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and
amplification (Franco-Duarte et al., 2019; Law et al., 2018). Due to the highly
conserved nature of 16S rRNA, universal primers for rRNA gene amplification can
also be used (Theron & Cloete, 2000). Thus, 16S rRNA gene is considered as the
gold standard for taxonomic and phylogenetic analyses among bacteria (Law et
al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016).

Development on molecular techniques resulted to easy and accurate
characterization and identification of Streptomyces that is particularly important in
drug discovery and development research (Kataoka et al., 1997; Law et al., 2018).

Still, a polyphasic taxonomic approach (i.e., phenotyping techniques in

30

combination with molecular genotyping methods) is important to accurately
identify, characterize, and better understand Streptomyces taxonomy (Anderson
& Wellington, 2001; Law et al. 2018; Theron & Cloete, 2000). Likewise,
identification techniques should be reproducible and cost-effective (Anderson &

Wellington, 2001).

2.9.1. Isolation of genomic DNA from bacterial cells

DNA analyses begin with the isolation of genomic DNA from pure culture of
bacteria (Ahmed et al., 2013; Moore et al., 2004; Shin, 2018). In general, DNA
isolation techniques: (1) should be rapid and reproducible with high sensitivity and
specificity, (2) does not require specialized equipment, (3) utilize harmless
reagents, and (4) the resulting extracted genomic DNA should be pure and free
from contamination (Cotarlet et al., 2010; Shin, 2018). Isolation of genomic DNA
involves three main procedures: cell disruption, DNA extraction, and DNA
purification (Ahmed et al., 2013; Moore et al., 2004; Shin, 2018).

Several cell disruption techniques are available to release genomic DNA
from bacterial cells such as chemical, enzymatic, and physical disruptions.
Chemical cell disruption using chelating agents such as cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) are commonly used
for the isolation of genomic DNA because of their effectiveness (Ahmed et al.,
2013; Moore et al., 2004); CTAB is efficient when isolating genomic DNA from
bacteria with large amount of polysaccharide, while EDTA disrupts the stability of

cells through binding with divalent cations (e.g., Mg2*, Mn?*) (Moore et al., 2004).

31

These chelating agents also reduce contamination with protein and humic acid,
thus leading to higher DNA yield (Herrera & Cockell, 2007; Miller et al., 1999;
Moore et al., 2004; Sheetal et al., 2013). Likewise, enzymatic cell disruption using
proteinase K and lysozyme are usually used in combination with chemical-based
techniques, the enzymes however are ineffective against cell disruption of most
Gram-positive bacteria due to their thick peptidoglycan layer (Ahmed et al., 2013;
Moore et al., 2004; Shin, 2018). Lastly, bacterial cells that are difficult to lyse using
chemical and enzymatic disruption techniques may be lysed using physical cell
disruption techniques (e.g., centrifugation, microwave, column separation, vacuum
separation), but these techniques are labor-intensive and requires special
instrumentation (Ahmed et al., 2013; Moore et al., 2004). Under acidic conditions,
DNA is unstable due to depurination-induced degradation (Herrera & Cockell,
2007). Thus, it is also important to consider that cell disruption should be
conducted in a buffered medium (i.e., pH 8-9) since an alkaline pH decreases
electrostatic interactions between proteins and DNA, inhibits activity of nuclease,
and helps in denaturing cellular proteins (Moore et al., 2004).

Post-cell disruption of bacterial cells, genomic DNA should be extracted
using either intercalating agents (e.g., cesium chloride/ethidium bromide) or
organic solvents. Cesium chloride/ethidium bromide (EtBr) density gradient
centrifugation was the standard DNA extraction technique since this simple
technique produces high yield of DNA. However, this technique is labor-intensive,
and EtBr is potentially teratogenic and carcinogenic (Moore et al., 2004; Shin,

2018). On the other hand, chloroform-phenol extraction is a technique known to

32

significantly increase DNA yield that involves vigorous mixing of lysed bacterial
cells and chloroform-phenol by centrifugation, which separates the bacterial
genomic DNA (i.e., in the upper/aqueous phase) and denatured proteins and
polysaccharides (i.e., remains within the lower/organic phase) (Miller et al., 1999;
Moore et al., 2004; Shin, 2018).

Lastly, purified genomic DNA should be recovered from the aqueous phase
by alcohol precipitation (e.g., ethanol or isopropanol) with salt such as sodium
acetate. Washing of the aqueous layer-containing genomic DNA with ethanol or
isopropanol will remove any remaining contaminants (Moore et al., 2004; Shin,
2018). It is crucial to ensure that the final extracted genomic DNA is pure and free
from contaminants such as carbohydrates, proteins, and other nucleic acids as
these substances will negatively affect the amplification and sequencing
processes (Ahmed et al., 2013; Shin, 2018; Smith et al., 2003).

Regardless of the technique used, the goal of DNA isolation is to remove
contaminants and/or inhibitory substances and obtain the highest yield of pure
genomic DNA since this is vital for succeeding analyses (Ahmed et al., 2013;
Herrera & Cockell, 2007; Shin, 2018; Verheyen et al., 2012). Quality of the purified
DNA can be checked by measuring the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm
(A260/280) using a spectrophotometer (Cotarlet et al., 2010; Shin, 2018). The ideal
A260/280 value is 1.7-2.0 that indicates purity of the isolated genomic DNA;
absorbance ratio lower than 1.7 indicates protein contamination and should be

subjected to further alcohol precipitation, while absorbance ratio over 2.0 indicates

33

presence of RNA and should be treated with DNase-free RNase and further

alcohol precipitation (Cotarlet et al., 2010; Moore et al., 2004; Shin, 2018).

2.9.2. Amplification of DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Extracted DNA templates are subjected to amplification via PCR and can
be used for further comprehensive DNA sequence studies. Amplification via PCR
is simple, rapid, and inexpensive technique that amplifies single or few copies of
DNA fragments and generate up to millions of copies of that DNA sequence (Joshi
& Deshpande, 2010). It involves three main steps: denaturation, annealing, and
extension (Joshi & Deshpande, 2010; Lo & Chan, 2006).

The first step in DNA amplification is denaturation wherein the target double-
stranded DNA is separated into two pieces of single-stranded DNA through heating
at high temperatures (i.e., 90-97 °C) (Joshi & Deshpande, 2010; Lo & Chan,
2006). Inadequate denaturation of DNA strands is a common cause of failed PCR
amplification (Lo & Chan, 2006).

DNA template strands are then subjected to the annealing phase that
occurs at a lower temperature (i.e., 50-60 °C), which allows the primers to
hybridize to their corresponding complementary template strands (Joshi &
Deshpande, 2010). Primers are designed to converge with the sequence of
interest, with an ideal GC content of approximately 50% and 18-30 bases long. It
is important to avoid the use of primers with three or more cytosines or guanines
and complementarity at the 3’ ends to reduce the possibility of nonspecifically

priming GC-rich sequences and primer-dimer artifact formation respectively (Bej

34

et al., 1991; Lo & Chan, 2006). Commonly used primers for DNA amplification of
bacteria are the universal primers 27F and 1492R (Frank et al., 2008).

Lastly, the newly formed DNA strand of template with attached primers is
extended to generate a complimentary copy of DNA strand (Joshi & Deshpande,
2010). This extension phase is carried out at 72 °C facilitated by the thermostable
Taq DNA polymerase that adds nucleotides at the 3’ end of the annealed primers
to synthesize two new double-stranded DNA with each strand containing one old
and one newly synthesized DNA strand (Joshi & Deshpande, 2010; Lo & Chan,
2006).

This three-step cycle is repeated for a few cycles doubling the amount of
product each cycle and creating multiple copies of the original DNA strand (Joshi
& Deshpande, 2010); the usual number of cycles for a whole amplification process
is around 25~30 cycles and repeating the cycle above 35 is discouraged because
of the little positive effect it has since a plateau occurs due to substrates depletion,
reduced denaturation efficiency, and Taq DNA polymerase inactivation (Joshi &
Deshpande, 2010; Kainz, 2000; Lo & Chan, 2006). It is also vital that the cycling
conditions and reaction mixture are prepared accordingly to ensure proper
amplification of DNA (Joshi & Deshpande, 2010); the use of automated thermal
cycling ensures the accuracy of temperatures at each phase of amplification (Bej

et al., 1991; Lo & Chan, 2006).

35

2.9.3. DNA sequencing technology

DNA sequencing involves the identification of the accurate order of
nucleotides (i.e., adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine) in a genome (Tipu &
Shabbir, 2015). Sanger sequencing technique is considered as the gold standard
for determination of nucleic acid sequences because of its good separation
efficiency, high-throughput capacity, high speed analysis, and cost-effectiveness
(Ban & Song, 2014; Crossley et al., 2020; Durney et al., 2015).

In Sanger sequencing, amplified DNA is annealed to primers and extended
by the Taq DNA polymerase, which incorporates fluorescently labelled chain-
terminating dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) that stops the elongation
reaction leading to distinct DNA fragments (Ban & Song, 2014; Crossley et al.,
2020; Tipu & Shabbir, 2015). Long and undegraded strands of the target template
DNA are required for accurate sequencing results; it is critical that DNA should be
purified using purification techniques (e.g., as column-based, bead-based, or
enzymatic techniques) to remove enzymes, unincorporated dNTPs, unbound
primers, and other contaminants that can obscure sequencing data (Crossley et
al., 2020).

The final step of DNA sequencing is data analysis. DNA sequence of the
isolated DNA may be obtained using different automated sequence analysis
equipment with built-in DNA sequence analysis software that performs base calling
or assigning bases to chromatogram peaks (e.g., 3730x/ DNA Analyzer of Applied
Biosystems, USA) (Crossley et al., 2020; Yoon et al., 2011). DNA analysis

equipment have detectors that determine the DNA sequence based on the

36

electrophoretic migration of the fluorescently labelled bases in capillary tubes (Ban
& Song, 2014; Tipu & Shabbir, 2015; Yoon et al., 2011) Similarly, various DNA
analysis software packages are available that can be used for base calling and
quality control (e.g., Sequencing Analysis Software of Thermo Fisher Scientific,

USA) (Crossley et al., 2020).

2.9.4. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences
2.9.4.1. Sequence assessment, identification, and alignment.

Quality assessment of sequencing results is vital prior to
phylogenetic analysis. This involves visual inspection and trimming of low-
quality regions on chromatograms of sequences using sequence analysis
software (e.g., MEGA). Post-quality assessment, sequences are compared
to reference sequences on public access databases (e.g., BLAST) to
determine their identity (Crossley et al., 2020). The Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool (BLAST) (https://blast.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) is a
sequence similarity bioinformatics tool developed to identify similar regions
between sequences (Crossley et al., 2020; Law et al., 2018). BLAST
program displays sequences that are identical to the sequence of interest
based on maximum score and E-values (i.e., sequence with the highest
maximum score and lowest E-values will be displayed first) (Crossley et al.,
2020; Hall, 2013). As a publication requirement, DNA sequences should be
submitted to public sequence database such as GenBank

(http://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/genbank) (Law et al., 2018; Sayers et al.,

37

2019; Wright et al., 2012). Similarly, submitted sequences should be free of
chimeras (i.e., sequences with two or more sequences from different
lineages concatenated to form a single sequence) that affects accurate
identification of organisms (Huber et al., 2004; Wright et al., 2012); chimeras
can be detected on sequences using chimera identification software such
as the DECIPHER program (Wright et al., 2012).

Sequences under investigation and identical reference sequences
are also aligned using multiple sequence alignment algorithms to determine
evolutionary relatedness (Crossley et al., 2020; Hall, 2013). Sequences are
organized by aligning same sequence features together to reveal patterns
that may elucidate phenotypic and functional variability (Kemena &
Notredame, 2009; Thompson et al., 1994). Multiple sequence alignment
algorithms are classified into three categories: evolution-based algorithms,
consistency-based algorithms, and progressive approach algorithms (Kapli
et al., 2020). Evolution-based algorithms (e.g., StatAlign, BAli-Phy)
presume a specific evolutionary model of deletions and insertions and jointly
estimates the phylogeny and alignment in a Bayesian framework; although
considered as methodologically sound, these algorithms however are
computationally challenging (Kapli et al., 2020). Consistency-based
algorithms (e.g., T-Coffee, ProbCons) on the other hand assess all pairwise
alignments using probabilistic modelling and determine the alignment that
maximizes consistency among all pairs based on quality scores, but

analysis time using consistency-based algorithms are slower compared to

38

progressive algorithms (Kapli et al., 2020). Lastly, progressive algorithms
(e.g., CLUSTAL W, MUSCLE) are the most commonly used alignment
algorithms since they are less computationally challenging and alignment
of sequences is rapid (Edgar, 2004a; Kapli et al., 2020; Pais et al., 2014).
In progressive algorithms, a heuristic technique is initially used to
estimate relationships between sequences and build a guide tree or the
initial alignment consisting of the highly related pair of sequences; distantly
telated sequences are then progressively added to the guide tree (Edgar,
2004a; Kapli et al., 2020; Pais et al, 2014). However, the progressive
algorithms, particularly CLUSTAL W, are unable to remove errors once they
are introduced at earlier stages, which limits their accuracy (Kemena &
Notredame, 2009; Pais et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 1994). Despite being
a progressive alignment algorithm, MUSCLE (MUltiple Sequence
Comparison by Log-Expression) has an iterative refinement stage that can
correct alignment errors (i.e., alignments are repeatedly partitioned and
realigned until no true quality improvements are observed) (Edgar, 2004a;
Kemena & Notredame, 2009; Pais et al., 2014). Moreover, performance
assessment of MUSCLE using four alignment accuracy benchmarks (i.e.,
SABmark, BAIiBASE, PREFAB, SMART) revealed that MUSCLE obtained
the highest performance score (i.e., more accurate and faster) in
comparison to other multiple sequence alignment algorithms such as
CLUSTAL W, T-Coffee, and MAFFT that are more computationally complex

(Edgar, 2004a, 2004b; Kapli et al., 2020).

39

2.9.4.2. Phylogenetic Tree-building Techniques.

Aligned sequences can be analyzed via computer-assisted
phylogenetic analysis to generate a phylogenetic tree, a rapid and easy tool
for identifying and establishing relatedness between species or taxa
(Kataoka et al., 1997; Law et al., 2018; Naser-Khdour et al., 2019; Yang et
al., 2016). The phylogenetic trees contain taxa, branches, nodes, clades,
and an outgroup. Taxa or leaves (i.e., taxonomic groups such as species)
are linked by branches that converge at nodes. Nodes represents an
evolutionary event or the common ancestor shared by the group
descendant taxa or a clade (i.e., descendants in a clade are more closely
telated to each other than descendants in other clades) (Hall, 2013; Law et
al., 2018). Moreover, an outgroup is the least related taxonomic unit to the
group of species under investigation and used to root a phylogenetic tree
(Holder & Lewis, 2003; Law et al., 2018).

Different tree-building techniques are available to create a
phylogenetic tree such as distance-based and character-based techniques.
Ideally, the tree-building technique should have low computer memory
requirement, computationally less intensive, and can generate an accurate
tree. Distance-based techniques are relatively faster but are less accurate.
In contrast, character-based techniques produce either the true tree or the
tree topologically closer to the true tree (Sardaraz et al., 2012).

In distance-based tree building techniques (e.g., NJ and UPGMA),

phylogenetic trees are constructed based on the evolutionary distance

40

between aligned sequences (Kapli et al., 2020; Law et al., 2018; Sardaraz
et al., 2012). Neighbor-joining (NJ) technique determines the difference
between two sequences and create a tree based on the distance values,
that is a repeated process of joining pairs of closest neighbors and
continuous insertion of a common ancestor between these closest
neighbors until a phylogenetic tree with a combination of common ancestors
is created (Law et al., 2018). Although computation speed is relatively fast,
NJ does not search for the optimal tree (i.e., the tree generated does not
accurately reflect the evolutionary distances between the sequences and
make them look closer to each other artificially) (Holder & Lewis, 2003; Kapli
et al., 2020). Whereas Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean
(UPGMA) technique builds a tree by joining branches with closely related
pairs of sequences (Sardaraz et al., 2012). Similar with NJ, UPGMA does
not accurately show the actual evolutionary distances between sequences
(Holder & Lewis, 2003; Kapli et al., 2020).

On the other hand, character-based techniques (e.g., MP, ML, Bl)
develop phylogenetic trees that best explain the variation in a set of
sequences by optimizing the distribution of the patterns for every character
or site in sequences (Law et al., 2018; Sardaraz et al., 2012). Maximum
Parsimony (MP) technique selects the most parsimonious tree or tree with
the fewest number of substitutions or mutations among all reconstructions
of sequences to explain the data, which might be misleading since

mutational pathway in the evolutionary tree is unknown and mutational

41

changes across all branches of the tree is unlikely to be equal leading to
systematic error or the selection of the inaccurate tree (Holder & Lewis,
2003; Kapli et al., 2020; Law et al., 2018; Sardaraz et al., 2012). Moreover,
both Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (Bl) techniques
construct phylogenetic trees according to the likelihood function and the
selected nucleotide substitution model (Kapli et al., 2020). ML technique
selects the most likely tree from all possible trees that could explain the
evolutionary distances between the given sequence data (Holder & Lewis,
2003; Law et al., 2018); ML also consider all possible mutational pathways
that match the given data and corrects several mutational changes in
sequences (Holder & Lewis, 2003). However, the computation time burden
and computer memory requirement of ML limits its use in evolutionary
distance analysis (Holder & Lewis, 2003). Although BI technique also builds
phylogenetic trees based on the likelihood function and select the tree that
best explain the data, it is more computationally challenging since coding
knowledge is needed (Douady et al., 2003; Sardaraz et al., 2012; Williams
& Moret, 2003).

The accuracy of the generated phylogenetic tree can be evaluated
using the Bootstrap Test (Felsenstein, 1985; Hedges, 1992; Law et al.,
2018). It involves construction of a phylogeny from resampling of
nucleotides in sequences and the resulting frequency of appearance of a
specific phylogenetic group among all the generated phylogenetic trees

from replication of the data indicates the confidence level of that specific

42

clade in a tree or its bootstrap value (Felsenstein, 1985; Hedges, 1992; Law
et al., 2018; Russo & Selvatti, 2018). Computation time and number of
teplications should be considered prior to bootstrap analysis (i.e., accurate
results will be obtained using higher number of replications but require more
analysis time; fewer replications will run faster but will result to statistical
inaccuracy) (Hedges, 1992; Russo & Selvatti, 2018). Conducting only 100
to 500 replications will not produce accurate bootstrap values (Russo &
Selvatti, 2018). It is recommended to use at least 1000 Bootstrap
teplications to obtain bootstrap values corresponding to 95% confidence
level (Hedges, 1992). Bootstrap values of 70 and above denote clades that
are strongly supported (i.e., more accurate and similar results will be

observed even when conducting more replications) (Holder & Lewis, 2003).

2.9.4.3. MEGA: A sequence analysis software.

The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software
is an open access, multi-platform software with various analytical tools and
techniques for phylogenomics such as sequence alignment assembly and
phylogeny reconstruction (Kumar et al., 2018; Law et al., 2018; Tamura et
al., 2011). MEGA contains different algorithms to construct a phylogenetic
tree from the aligned sequences such as neighbor-joining, maximum
parsimony, and maximum likelihood. MEGA is also equipped with a
statistical program that selects the best-fit nucleotide substitution model for

a given set of sequences based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and

43

2.10.

Akaike information criterion (AIC) (i.e., choosing the suitable model
significantly improve phylogeny estimation and using the wrong model will
lead to inconsistent and inaccurate phylogenetic tree) (Posada & Crandall,
2001; Seo & Kishino, 2009; Tamura et al., 2011; Tamura et al., 2021); the
best nucleotide substitution model is the model with the lowest BIC and AIC
scores (Posada & Crandall, 2001; Seo & Kishino, 2009; Tamura et al.,
2011). Thus, systematic error due to inaccurate model assumptions can be
avoided (Kapli et al., 2020). Furthermore, analysis speed of MEGA is similar
to the Random Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RaxML) software and
faster than the Phylogenetic inferences using Maximum Likelihood (PhyML)

software (Tamura et al., 2011).

Streptomyces research and The Philippines

As shown in Table 2.3, there are abundant literatures characterizing

Streptomyces in various Philippine environments.

In 1952, the drug ilotycin, now commonly known as erythromycin, was
discovered by researchers from the United States of America. Erythromycin is a
broad-spectrum antibiotic produced by Streptomyces erythreus isolated in a soil
sample from Panay Island, lloilo City, Philippines (Griffith & Black, 1970; McGuire
et al., 1952). In 1955, researchers from University of Illinois, USA isolated the
antifungal agent filipin from Streptomyces filipinensis; filpinin however displays
affinity to both ergosterol (i.e., major sterol in fungal membranes) and cholesterol
(i.e., major sterol in human membranes) and therefore is not suitable for use by
humans (Whitfield et al., 1955). In 1985, researchers from Tokyo Research

Center, Japan discovered a strain of Streptomyces hygroscopicus No. J296-21

45

(ATCC 39150) from a soil sample collected from the Philippines capable of
producing the aminoglycoside antibiotic called inosamycin (Tsunakawa et al.,
1985). In 1988, another group of researchers from Tokyo Research Center, Japan
was able to produce a new aminoglycoside antibiotic called boholmycin from
Streptomyces hygroscopicus H617-25 isolated in a soil from Bohol, Philippines
(Saitoh et al., 1988). Likewise, researchers from Bristol-Myers Squibb Research
Institute, Japan discovered lagunamycin, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, from
Streptomyces sp. AA0310 collected at a university in Laguna, Philippines (Nihei et
al., 1993). Moreover, researchers from Germany reported the isolation of
roseoflavin, a riboflavin analog with antibiotic activity against Gram-positive
bacteria, in Streptomyces davawensis DSM 101723" from a soil sample collected
in Davao City, Philippines (Landwehr et al., 2018; Otani et al., 1974). However,
although all of the soil samples from these studies originated from the Philippines
and all resulted to the discovery of new antimicrobials, the primary investigators of
these studies are from foreign countries and no local researchers were recognized
in any of them.

Local studies also contributed on this field albeit these are more
concentrated on the isolation of Streptomyces from other habitats such as marine
environment. The first recorded study of successful isolation of actinomycetes in
marine environment was in 2007 by Parungao and colleagues who isolated 54
actinomycetes from Samal City, Davao del Norte; 14 of which were active against
at least one of the test organisms used in their study. Similarly, Azcuna et al. (2011)

isolated four actinomycin compounds from a marine sponge-associated

46

Streptomyces. In collaboration with foreign researchers, new antimicrobials were
also isolated from different strains of Streptomyces. Pulicatins were isolated in
Streptomyces sp. CP32 in a cone snail-associated streptomycete collected from
Mactan Island, Cebu (Lin et al., 2010). Moreover, the lobophorin compounds were
purified from a mollusk-associated strain of Streptomyces collected from Mactan
Island, Cebu (Lin et al., 2014). Streptomyces griseorubens strain DSD069 isolated
from marine sediments in Romblon was shown to produce the antimicrobial
compounds 1-hydroxybisanhydroaklavinone and bisanhydroaklavinone (Paderog
et al., 2020). In addition, Streptomyces sp. strain DSDO11 isolated in marine
sediments from Islas de Gigantes, Iloilo was reported to produce polycyclic
aromatic polyketide angucycline glycosides fridamycin A and fridamycin D with
antibiotic activity against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (Sabido et al.,
2020). Streptomyces albogriseolus also isolated from Islas de Gigantes, Iloilo was
established to have anticancer and antimicrobial activities (Sabido et al., 2021).
Similar investigation was conducted by Tenebro and colleagues who reported the
isolation of Streptomyces species in the marine sediments collected from West-
Central Philippines that exhibited antibiotic activity against Escherichia coli,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Lastly,
Streptomyces sp. H28 isolated from Meycauayan River, Bulacan was revealed to
produce 13 secondary metabolites (Verdera et al., 2021).

Furthermore, other local studies engaged on the agricultural application of
the compounds derived from different strains of Streptomyces. |In 2015,

researchers reported the potential grain growth promoting abilities of a

47

Streptomyces mutabilis strain and an unidentified Streptomyces strain (Cruz et al.,
2015). Another strain of Streptomyces mutabilis was also reported to contribute to
the improvement of rice production (Suralta et al., 2018). Lastly, Streptomyces sp.
PSC3-D2 strain was described to promote crop protection by production of
compounds with insecticidal properties (Custodio & Alcantara, 2019).

It is evident that local studies are more focused on the isolation of
Streptomyces from marine environment and on the agricultural application of the
compounds derived from Streptomyces. In fact, only few local studies are directly
involved in researching soil Streptomyces. In 1962, a survey of Philippine soils for
the presence of antimicrobial-producing Streptomyces was conducted and 80
Streptomyces with antimicrobial activity were isolated (Sevilla-Santos & De Leon,
1962). However, no follow up studies were conducted and thus no new
antimicrobials were produced. Likewise, Zhou and colleagues (2019) studied the
biosynthesis of pentamycin (i.e., a polyene antibiotic for the treatment of
trichomoniasis, vaginal candidiasis and mixed infections) from Streptomyces sp.
$816 isolated from a mangrove soil collected in Surigao del Sur. Oliveros and
colleagues (2021) also reported the isolation of Streptomyces sp. A1-09 in the
volcanic soil samples from Mount Mayon, Albay, Philippines that possess
anticancer and anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus activities. In
conclusion, studies with regards to the local isolation of Streptomyces for

discovering new antimicrobials from soil habitats are insufficient.

48

2.11. Enhanced isolation of Streptomyces from different soil habitats in
Calamba City, Laguna, Philippines using a modified integrated
approach
In our previous study published on the International Journal of Microbiology

(Antido & Climacosa, 2022), we utilized a modified integrated approach for the

isolation of Streptomyces species from soil samples. Table 2.4 shows the soil

characteristics and the frequencies of bacterial and Streptomyces isolates from
each soil habitat examined in this study. We observed that more Streptomyces
species were isolated from soil habitats (e.g., dumpsite and garden) at higher

altitudes, with slightly acidic to alkaline pH and temperatures ranging from 29-33

°C, which is consistent with the reported optimum conditions that support

Streptomyces growth (Barka et al., 2016; Goodfellow et al., 2012).

Bacterial load varied in each collection site, where the highest bacterial
count of 4.6 x 10’ CFU/g of soil was from grassland, while the lowest count was
from the forest with 6.2 x 10° CFU/g of soil. Three hundred sixty-seven (367)
distinct colonial growths were seen on starch casein agar (SCA) post-incubation;
103 (28%) of these isolates were morphologically and biochemically consistent
with Streptomyces species (Figure 2.2), with the highest number isolated from
dumpsite soil (35 out of 103; 34%). The same observation was noted in previous
studies of Oskay (2009) and Kizito and Nwankwo (2013) where higher densities of
Streptomyces have been isolated in nonagricultural soils like dumpsites.

The color of the isolated Streptomyces colonies varied as depicted in Figure

2.3, although more than half are gray and white. Melanin production was seen on

49

14 Streptomyces colonies, notably from dumpsite, garden, and riverside soils.
Barka et al. (2016) suggest that melanin production has a vital role in enhancing
Streptomyces’ capability to adapt and survive in challenging and harsh

environmental conditions.

Microscopic examination revealed all 103 isolates are Gram-positive,
filamentous with branching mycelia (Figure 2.4) and the majority possesses
tectiflexibiles (74%) spore chains. Table 2.5 displays biochemical test results
consistent with the usual metabolic profile of Streptomyces species—catalase-
positive, indole-negative, and can utilize glucose as their carbon source.
Interestingly, most of the hydrogen sulfide producers (21 out of 37; 57%) came
from the dumpsite, which is known to contain alternative sources of nutrients (e.g.,
food waste, paper, plastic) for microbial use with hydrogen sulfide as an end
product (Ko et al., 2015; Tsuchida et al., 2011). In addition, Long et al. (2016)
reported that the accumulation of hydrogen sulfide may cause an increase in soil
pH, which favors the growth of Streptomyces. This could likewise explain the

abundance of Streptomyces isolated from dumpsites as seen in this study.

Our approach to Streptomyces isolation combined pretreatment,
enrichment, and selective inhibition methods. The pretreatment employed in this
study consisted of desiccation, crushing, calcium carbonate supplementation, and
incubation on a rotary shaker, as opposed to published studies that used these
techniques singly or in combination (Goodfellow et al., 2012; Hayakawa, 2008;
Kumar & Jadeja, 2016; Njenga et al., 2017; Oskay, 2009). Starch casein agar as
an enrichment culture medium (Oskay, 2009; Rashad et al., 2015) and antibiotic
supplementation (e.g., nystatin and ampicillin) for selective inhibition (Hayakawa,
2008; Kumari et al., 2006) have been shown to be most effective in isolating
Streptomyces. Performing this modified integrated approach, a substantially
higher number of Streptomyces were isolated compared to similar studies (Table

2.6). Up to 10X more Streptomyces were isolated in this study compared to

published literature using one pretreatment method alone and no antibiotic

isolated in our study employing the modified integrated approach, in contrast to
early studies that applied antibiotic supplementation and one to two pretreatment
methods only.

As a final point, we isolated 103 soil Streptomyces from different soil
habitats in Calamba City, Laguna, Philippines, with the highest number collected
from dumpsite soil. However, further studies are needed to investigate the potential
antimicrobial activity and to identify the isolates at the species level through

molecular methods.

54

2.12. Maintenance of isolated Streptomyces strains

Successful isolation of Streptomyces will not end by simply isolating new
strains—new strains should be maintained for further targeted investigations such
as isolation of bioactive secondary metabolites. Techniques for the maintenance
of the isolated strains mainly depend on the intended duration of preservation,
which can be either short-term or long-term preservation (Goodfellow et al., 2012).

Short-term preservation of Streptomyces is useful for culturing strains for
different genetic analyses, secondary metabolites production, and_ strain
production (Shepherd et al., 2010). It can be easily done through preparation of
spore suspensions on agar and kept at 4 °C, agar slope cultures stored at 4 °C, or
spore suspensions mixed with glycerol that are then stored at -20 °C (Goodfellow
et al., 2012). However, storage of Streptomyces on solid culture media is
recommended for only 2-8 weeks and viability of strains may significantly
decrease afterwards (Shepherd et al., 2010).

On the other hand, long-term preservation of Streptomyces isolates is also
useful for genetic analyses, secondary metabolites production, and strain
production (Shepherd et al., 2010). Long-term preservation can be performed by
lyophilization of suspension of mycelia and spores in 10% skim milk,
cryopreservation of spores and mycelia at -196 °C in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tube
using liquid nitrogen, or spore suspension preparations in 20% glycerol that can
be frozen and maintained at -20 °C (Goodfellow et al., 2012; Shepherd et al., 2010;
Waksman & Henrici, 1948). In contrast to storage on solid culture media,

Streptomyces preserved on glycerol stocks are still viable and can be stored for

55

several years. However, isolates may lose viability after numerous freeze thaw
cycles (Shepherd et al., 2010).

Whatever the preservation methods used, improper handling of
Streptomyces isolates leading to contamination should always be avoided. Thus,
proper aseptic technique during handling of Streptomyces is highly recommended

(Shepherd et al., 2010).

2.13. Conceptual framework

Figure 2.5 shows the conceptual framework of this study. The Streptomyces
(n=103) we previously isolated from diverse soil habitats in Calamba City, Laguna,
Philippines were used in this study. All Streptomyces isolates were screened for
their potential antimicrobial activity against different test organisms such as
Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Aspergillus
fumigatus, and Trichophyton rubrum. \solates with antimicrobial activity were then
identified at the species level using molecular techniques such as 16S rRNA

sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.

Figure 2.5. Conceptual framework of the study

The soil habitats where the Streptomyces were isolated, the altitude level
of the soil habitats, soil pH, soil temperature, and morphological and biochemical
characteristics of the isolates are the mediating variables of this study. These
aforementioned mediating variables explain the antimicrobial potential of the soil
Streptomyces isolates against the test organisms and were measured on the
previous study (Antido & Climacosa, 2022).

Moreover, inoculum size of test organisms and Streptomyces isolates,
incubation time, and incubation temperature are the confounding variables that
could affect the test organisms and the antimicrobial activity of Streptomyces
isolates. However, all of these confounding variables were controlled since a
standardized protocol were followed: (1) suspensions were standardized using
McFarland standards and (2) Streptomyces isolates and test organisms were

incubated according to their growth requirement.

2.14. Operational definition of variables

Antimicrobials — substances that kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms such
as bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

Antimicrobial control strips — antimicrobial strips impregnated with optimized
concentrations of antimicrobials (i.e., 100 pg/ml of ciprofloxacin, 120 pg/ml of
vancomycin, and 400 g/ml of fluconazole) and used as positive controls.
Chimeras — sequences with two or more sequences from different lineages
concatenated to form a single sequence detected using DECIPHER 2.25.4.
Closely related Streptomyces strains — Streptomyces strains on GenBank
database related to the Streptomyces isolates identified using Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) program.

Isolates with antimicrobial activity — Streptomyces isolates that showed >6 mm
of zone of inhibition against the test organism/s.

Isolates without antimicrobial activity — Streptomyces isolates that showed 6
mm of zone of inhibition against the test organism/s.

Negative controls — used to observe normal growth of test organisms (i.e., plates
without Streptomyces isolates, plates with blank filter paper strips, and plates with
Salmonella typhi ATCC 19430).

Streptomyces albidus BIOTECH 1564 — Streptomyces species obtained from
the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of the
Philippines Los Bafios (BIOTECH-UPLB) used as organism control because of its

antimicrobial potential.

Streptomyces isolates — soil Streptomyces isolated from diverse soil habitats in
Calamba City, Laguna, Philippines (Antido & Climacosa, 2022).
Test organisms — selected microorganisms used to determine the potential

antimicrobial activity of the Streptomyces isolates.

CHAPTER Ill

METHODOLOGY

3.1. Study design

This was a descriptive basic science research that aimed to determine the
potential antimicrobial activity and identify the soil Streptomyces isolated from
Calamba City, Laguna, Philippines (Antido & Climacosa, 2022) at the species level
using molecular techniques such as 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic

analysis.

3.2. Study setting

Different soil habitats (i.e., dumpsite, forest, garden, grassland, and
riverside) in Calamba City, Laguna, Philippines were explored by Antido &
Climacosa (2022) for the isolation of Streptomyces. And, a total of 103 soil
Streptomyces were isolated from these habitats. The potential antimicrobial
activity of the Streptomyces isolates were determined in the Department of Medical
Microbiology Laboratory, College of Public Health, University of the Philippines
Manila. Sequencing of the isolates with antimicrobial activity was outsourced at the

University of the Philippines - Philippine Genome Center (UP-PGC).
3.3. Soil Streptomyces isolates

Streptomyces species isolated from our previous study (Antido &

Climacosa, 2022) were used in the current experiments. Briefly, a total of 25 soil

60

samples were collected from five diverse locations in Calamba City, Laguna,
Philippines (i.e., dumpsite, garden, grassland, forest, riverside). Five soil samples
(400 g) were collected on each location from the depth of 0-20 cm. Soil samples
were placed in tightly closed polyethylene bags to avoid spillage while being
transported to the laboratory. Collected soil samples were air-dried at room
temperature for 7 days to remove moisture and reduce the population of bacteria
other than Streptomyces. Air-dried samples were then manually crushed, mixed
thoroughly, and sieved through sterilized mesh to get rid of large debris (Aspiras
et al., 1971; Costa et al., 2018; Hayakawa, 2008; Goodfellow et al., 2012; Kumar
et al., 2016). Soil-CaCO3 mixtures (10:1 w/w) were prepared and incubated for 2
days at 30 °C in a closed sterile Petri dish (Ceylan at al., 2008; Oskay, 2009;
Goodfellow et al., 2012). Soil-CaCOs3 mixtures (20 g) were suspended in 180 ml of
sterile distilled water in a 250 ml flask followed by incubation (28-30 °C) on a rotary
shaker at 200 rpm for 30 min. Pure culture isolation of Streptomyces in soil
samples was performed using standard serial dilution plate technique on starch
casein agar (SCA) (M2054, HiMedia Laboratories, India) supplemented with 50
ug/ml of nystatin (Afunginal®, ACME Laboratories Ltd., Bangladesh) and 5 g/ml
of ampicillin (Ampicin®, Sandoz International GmbH, Germany) to minimize the
growth of contaminating fungi and bacteria, respectively (Fguira et al., 2012;
Gautham et al., 2012; Goodfellow et al., 2012; Kizito & Nwankwo, 2013; Maleki et
al., 2013; Oskay, 2009). Identification of the Streptomyces isolates up to the genus
level was done using a polyphasic method that includes cultural, morphological

(i.e., Gram stain appearance), and biochemical characteristics (i.e., catalase,

61

motility, nitrate reduction, urea hydrolysis, H2S production, indole production,
methyl red, Voges-Proskauer, citrate utilization, utilization of carbon sources [e.g.,
glucose, lactose, sucrose], and gas production observed on triple sugar iron slant).
Using this modified integrated approach, we isolated a total of 103 Streptomyces,

which were subjected to following screening.

3.4. Test organisms for screening of antimicrobial potential
Different test organisms were used to determine the potential antimicrobial
activity of the Streptomyces isolates. All test organisms were obtained from the
culture collection of Department of Medical Microbiology Laboratory, College of
Public Health, University of the Philippines Manila and the Department of
Laboratories, University of the Philippines - Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH).
Pure colony of test organisms were adjusted to that of 0.5 McFarland and were
used for screening. The test organisms that were used in this study are as follows:
« Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213,
Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300
= Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella
pneumoniae ATCC 13883, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
(ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (UP-PGH clinical isolate)
* Fungi: Candida albicans ATCC 14053, Aspergillus fumigatus (wild

isolate), Trichophyton rubrum (wild isolate)

62

3.5. Optimization of antimicrobial control strips

Antimicrobial control strips were prepared following published protocols with
few modifications (Oliveros et al., 2021; Qadrie et al., 2009; Sabido et al., 2021).
Briefly, filter paper strips (width: 6 mm; length: 80 mm) were prepared using
Whatman No. 1 filer paper. Filter paper strips were impregnated with different
concentrations of standard drugs ciprofloxacin (Acipro, Shijiazhuang No. 4
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., China) (i.e., 5, 10, 20, 40, 100 pg/ml) for Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria, vancomycin (VAN-CP 1 gm, BioRx Pharma Labs
LLP, India) (i.e., 15, 30, 60, 100, 120 jig/ml) for MRSA, and fluconazole (Fungican,
Amanta Healthcare Ltd., India) (ie., 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 yg/ml) for fungi.
Impregnation was performed in properly labelled sterile Petri dishes containing 20
ml of different concentrations of antimicrobials where the filter paper strips were
soaked for 10 min to fully absorb the antimicrobials. Filter paper strips impregnated
with antimicrobials were then sterilized at 130 °C for 30 min in hot air oven.
Sterilized filter paper strips with antimicrobials were aseptically placed on the
surface of Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) (M173, HiMedia Laboratories, India)
inoculated with 0.5 McFarland inoculum of representative test organisms (e.g., S.
aureus, E. coli, MRSA, C. albicans). Plates were incubated at 35 °C +2 °C for 16—
18 h and at 30 °C for 48 h for bacteria and fungi, respectively. Zones of inhibition
(in mm) were measured and compared with the results of antimicrobial
susceptibility test using ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and fluconazole disks as
positive controls and blank disk as negative control. Optimization was performed

in triplicates and mean values were considered for analysis.

63

3.6. Screening of antimicrobial potential of Streptomyces isolates
Screening of potential antimicrobial activity of the Streptomyces isolates
against test organisms was evaluated using cross-streak technique as previously
described (Adegboye & Babalola, 2013; Carvajal, 1947; Oskay, 2009; Salim et al.,
2017; Sapkota et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2016). Briefly, Streptomyces isolates were
screened for antagonism by inoculating a single streak of the pure isolate in the
center of MHA using a sterile cotton swab and were incubated at 30 °C for 7 days.
Test organisms were streaked perpendicular to the Streptomyces isolates and a
pattern (Appendix 1.5) under the plates were used to facilitate streaking followed
by incubation of all plates for 2 days at 30 °C. The potential antimicrobial activity
was determined by measuring the zone of inhibition (in mm) between the
Streptomyces isolate and the test organisms using a ruler. Screening was
performed in triplicates and mean values were considered for analysis.
Optimization was done with optimized concentrations used in subsequent
experiments. Control plates of the same medium with Streptomyces albidus
BIOTECH 1564 (i.e., organism control with antimicrobial potential [Kaewkla &
Franco, 2021]) obtained from the National Institute of Molecular Biology and
Biotechnology, University of the Philippines Los Bafios (BIOTECH-UPLB) and filter
paper strips impregnated with 100 jig/ml of ciprofloxacin for bacterial test
organisms except MRSA, 120 pg/ml of vancomycin for MRSA, and 400 pg/ml of
fluconazole for fungal test organisms were used as positive controls. Plates without

isolates, blank filter paper strips, and plates with Salmonella typhi ATCC 19430,

64

which was reported to have no antimicrobial production (Chua, 2020), were used

as negative controls.

3.7. Molecular Identification of Streptomyces Isolates

Isolates with antimicrobial activity were subjected to further analysis using
molecular methods. Pure cultures of Streptomyces isolates with antimicrobial
activity were grown on nutrient agar (1060, Condalab, Spain) for 7 days at 30 °C.
Genomic DNA isolation and subsequent 16S rRNA gene amplification and
sequencing were outsourced at the DNA Sequencing Core Facility - Philippine

Genome Center (DSCF-PGC).

3.7.1. Isolation of genomic DNA

Genomic DNA of Streptomyces isolates were extracted using the
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method. Cells were lysed through
suspension of approximately 10 mg cells in 500 yl 2% CTAB solution in
microcentrifuge tubes. Tubes with the Streptomyces cells were vortexed for 10 min
and heated in a dry bath at 60 °C for 30 min. Water-insoluble contaminants were
removed by organic extraction through addition of 250 ul of chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol to the solution. Tubes were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min;
supernatants containing the bacterial DNA were transferred in new microcentrifuge
tubes and pellets containing cellular debris were discarded. Genomic DNA
precipitates were further purified by adding 50 ul 3M sodium acetate (NaOAc)

solution. DNA precipitates were rinsed with 500 yl 75% ice-cold absolute ethanol

65

to remove traces of salt, followed by incubation at -20 °C for 1 hr and centrifugation
at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. Supernatants were discarded and DNA precipitates were
rinsed with 500 ul 75% ice-cold absolute ethanol. Tubes were then centrifuged for
1 min at 13,000 rpm; supernatants were discarded and DNA precipitates were air-
dried at room temperature for 15 min to remove residual ethanol. Air-dried DNA
precipitates were reconstituted by adding 30-50 ul nuclease-free water. Quality of
the genomic DNA was assessed using NanoDrop™ 8000 Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis examined on
Alphalmager Mini (ProteinSimple Instruments, Bio-Techne, USA) (i.e., genomic
DNA that displayed A260/A280 ratio of 1.7-2.0 and A260/A230 ratio of over 1.5
on spectrophotometer and intense single bands on electrophoresis were used for

amplification).

3.7.2. 16S rRNA amplification

The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from the genomic DNA obtained from the
cultures by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using universal primers 27F (5’-
AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3’) and 1492R (5’°-GGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-
3’). PCR was conducted in 10 ul total volume of reaction mixture containing 0.50
ul genomic DNA, 0.50 ul of each primer, 1 pl Taq buffer, 0.05 yl DNA polymerase,
0.50 pl MgCle, 0.50 pl dNTP mix, and 6.45 wl nuclease-free water. The
amplification reaction was performed using T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc., USA). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: initial

denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min,

66

annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and extension at 70 °C for 1 min; final extension at 72
°C for 10 min and hold at 4 °C to avoid sample degradation until further use. The
quality of amplified products was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis
examined on Alphalmager Mini (ProteinSimple Instruments, Bio-Techne, USA).

Amplified products that showed intense single bands were used on sequencing.

3.7.3. DNA sequencing

DNA sequencing was conducted on both forward and reverse strands via
Sanger sequencing. Universal primers 27F and 1492R (0.50 pl each) were added
to 9 pl PCR products. AMPure XP reagent (10 ul) was then added for solution
cleanup. PCR was performed on mixture containing 0.50 yl DNA template and
7.25 ul nuclease-free water. Cycle sequencing was performed in T100 Thermal
Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA) using the following thermal conditions:
initial denaturation at 96 °C for 1 min; 25 cycles of denaturation at 96 °C for 10 s,
annealing at 50 °C for 5 s, and extension at 62 °C for 4 min; hold at 4 °C until ready
for purification. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (70 pl) was added to the
solution and was stored at room temperature for 15 min. Tubes were centrifuged
at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at -4 °C followed by double ethanol precipitation (i.e.,
supernatant was discarded and 90 ul of 80% ethanol was added to the solution
followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at -4 °C). Supernatant was
discarded and the purified sequencing product was resuspended on 10 ul Hi-Di
Formamide. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the purified sequencing product was

acquired using BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied

67

Biosystems™, USA). The 3730x/ DNA Analyzer (96-capillary array, 50cm)
(Applied Biosystems™, USA) and 3730xI Data Collection Software v3.1 (Applied
Biosystems™, USA) were used to analyze and assemble the gene sequences.
Base calling was performed using Sequencing Analysis Software v5.4 (Applied

Biosystems™, USA).

3.7.4. Sequence similarity search and phylogenetic analysis

DECIPHER 2.25.4 was used to detect the presence of chimeras on the
sequences (Wright et al., 2012). The similarity of partial DNA sequences of
Streptomyces isolates with antimicrobial activity were compared with sequences
on GenBank database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)
program (https://blast.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) (Zhang et al., 2000).
Phylogenetic evolutionary analyses were conducted in Molecular Evolutionary
Genetics Analysis (MEGA) 11 software (Tamura et al., 2021). Sequences were
aligned using MUltiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation (MUSCLE)
algorithm (Edgar, 2004a). Evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum
Likelihood (Felsenstein, 1981) based on the Tamura-Nei model (TN93+G)
(Tamura & Nei, 1993) that was established to be the optimal model for these
sequence data. Neighbor-joining (Saitou & Nei, 1987) and maximum parsimony
(Fitch, 1971) trees were also constructed. Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius NBRC
161757 (AB184722.1) was used as the outgroup for calculations since this strain
was previously described as a species under the genus Streptomyces but was

correctly identified as a different organism (Labeda et al., 2012). Bootstrap values

68

(1000 replicates) were calculated to validate the robustness of the tree
(Felsenstein, 1985). The sequences were submitted to GenBank with accession

numbers shown in Table 4.4.

3.8. Maintenance of Streptomyces isolates

Streptomyces isolates with antimicrobial activity were preserved as glycerol
stocks following the protocol of Shepherd and colleagues (2010) with few
modifications. Briefly, 10 ml distilled water were added to the freshly prepared pure
culture of the Streptomyces isolates and completely suspended on water using
sterile wire loop. Suspended isolates were transferred on two sterile screw-top, 5
ml test tubes using sterile pipette. Test tubes were then vigorously mixed on a
vortex mixer and were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was
discarded post-centrifugation while the sediment was suspended on screw-top test
tubes containing 1:1 (v/v) mixture of distilled water and glycerol and stored at -20

°C for future use.

3.9. Data analysis

Descriptive analysis was utilized in this study. Tables were used to present
the phenotypic characteristics and soil habitat of Streptomyces isolates with
antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial activity of Streptomyces isolates and controls
were presented as mean values. Sequence similarity of Streptomyces isolates with
antimicrobial activity and closely related Streptomyces species were shown as

percentage. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on MEGA 11.

69

3.10. Ethical and biosafety considerations

The investigator declares no conflict of interest in conducting the study.

This study was registered at the University of the Philippines Manila
Research Grants Administration Office (RGAO-2022-0238). This study was also
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety and Biosecurity Committee,
University of the Philippines Manila (UPM-IBBC) (Protocol No. 2022-005, Approval
No. 2022-005) with Certification of Exemption from the University of the Philippines
Manila Research Ethics Board (UPMREB) (UPMREB 2022-0130-EX). This study
neither involve human participants nor identifiable biological samples, human
tissue, and data.

Streptomyces species are Biosafety Level 1 (BSL 1) organisms and are
generally recognized safe (GRAS) organisms. Moreover, different test organisms
that were used in this study such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis,
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia
coli, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton rubrum are Biosafety
Level 2 (BSL 2) organisms that could possibly cause disease to the investigator.
Nevertheless, standard laboratory health and safety protocols as well the
pandemic’s minimum health standards were followed throughout the study.
Likewise, cultures and contaminated materials were autoclaved at 121 °C for 15—

30 min before disposal as regular waste materials.

Table 4.1 presents the results of the optimization of antimicrobial control
strips. Ciprofloxacin (100 jig/ml), vancomycin (120 pg/ml), and fluconazole (400
g/ml) were used as positive controls for the screening of antimicrobial activity of
Streptomyces isolates since their results reflect the results of the positive control

disks (Figure 4.1).

4.2. Screening of antimicrobial potential of Streptomyces isolates

The 103 Streptomyces isolated from diverse soil habitats in Calamba City,
Laguna, Philippines were subjected to screening of antimicrobial activity (Figure
4.2). Out of 103 Streptomyces isolates screened for their antimicrobial activity, nine
have activity against at least two of the test organisms. Table 4.2 displays the
morphological and biochemical characteristics of these nine isolates. Four were
isolated from the dumpsite, two each from garden and grassland, and one from
the riverside. The isolates are either gray or white in color and mostly have
tetinaculiaperti spore chain morphology. All isolates are catalase-positive, reduce
nitrate to nitrite, indole-negative, and use glucose as carbon source. Isolates R5SC7
and D4C28 are methyl red-positive and Voges-Proskauer-positive, respectively.
All isolates are citrate-positive except isolate D2C6. Most of the isolates are
urease-positive and use lactose and sucrose as carbon source. Only isolates
D2C6, D4C28, D4C30, and GL5C13 are hydrogen sulfide-producers. Lastly, only

isolate D4C24 produces melanin on starch casein agar.

Table 4.3 shows the zone of inhibition (in mm) of the isolates with
antimicrobial activity against the test organisms used in this study. All isolates are
more active against Gram-positive bacteria compared to Gram-negative bacteria
and fungi except isolate D2C6 that is more active against Gram-negative bacteria.
However, only Streptomyces species isolated from the dumpsite successfully
inhibited ESBL-E. coli. Among the isolates, isolate D4C30 showed the most
remarkable antimicrobial activity and inhibited almost all the test organisms
including antimicrobial resistant bacteria (i.e., MRSA and ESBL-E. coli). Lastly, no

isolate has been shown to inhibit Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum.

4.3. Molecular identification of Streptomyces isolates

No chimeras were detected on the sequences using the DECIPHER
program. The proximity of the 16S rRNA gene of the isolates with antimicrobial
activity was compared with the available sequences on public database
(https:/Awww.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST) as presented on Table 4.4. Molecular identification of the Streptomyces
isolates with antimicrobial activity revealed that all of these isolates are closely
telated to the members of the genus Streptomyces. Sequence similarity search
tevealed that the isolates with antimicrobial activity are 94.20-99.93% closely
related to Streptomyces species on the GenBank database. Figure 4.3 displays
the phylogenetic tree generated using MEGA 11 showing the relatedness of
Streptomyces isolates and identical strains. The isolates clustered in one major
clade. Dumpsite isolate D4C30 formed a clade with the riverside isolate R5C7 and
grassland isolates GL3C6 and GL5C13 in the phylogenetic tree. Isolates in this
clade also exhibited more noteworthy antimicrobial activity against the test
organisms. Isolate D4C30 is closely related to Streptomyces thermocarboxydus
strain NBRC 163237 (99.02%). Isolates GL3C6, GL5C13, and R5C7 are closely
related to Streptomyces resistomycificus strain ISP 5133 and Streptomyces
hydrogenans strain NBRC 13475". Moreover, dumpsite isolates D2C6 and D4C28
formed a clade with garden isolates G1C18 and G1C44; these isolates are more
active against Gram-positive bacteria except isolate D2C6 that is more active
against Gram-negative bacteria. Isolate D2C6 is closely related to Streptomyces

malachitofuscus strain NBRC 130597 (99.63%). Isolates D4C28 and G1C18 are

78

closely related to Streptomyces griseoflavus strain NBRC 13044", while isolate
G1C44 is closely related to Streptomyces griseoloalbus strain NBRC 13046
(95.58%). Lastly, dumpsite isolate D4C24 is closely related to the environmental
isolate uncultured Streptomyces sp. clone D1 (94.20%). The 16S rRNA sequences
of these bioactive Streptomyces isolates were deposited in GenBank with

accession numbers shown in Table 4.4.

CHAPTER V

DISCUSSION

Antimicrobial resistance pandemic prompts the urgent need for novel
antimicrobials. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the antimicrobial
potential of 103 Streptomyces isolated and previously identified up to the genus
level by Antido & Climacosa (2022) using a polyphasic method that includes

cultural, morphological, and biochemical characterizations.

5.1. Antimicrobial potential of Streptomyces isolates

Out of 103 Streptomyces isolates, nine isolates inhibited the growth of at
least two of the test organisms used in this study. This varying degree of
antagonistic activity against the test organisms can be attributed to the test
organisms’ morphological differences (i.e., Gram-negative bacteria possess an
impermeable lipopolysaccharide membrane on their cell wall that made them less
susceptible to inhibitory metabolites as compared to Gram-positive bacteria that
only have peptidoglycan layer for protection) (Adegboye & Babalola, 2013; Basilio
et al., 2003; Maleki et al., 2013; Sapkota et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2016; Wadetwar
& Patil, 2013). In addition, 94 (91%) isolates did not show activity against the test
organisms. This however does not imply that these isolates are nonproducers of
useful secondary metabolites; this only suggests that these isolates does not
produce metabolites that can inhibit the growth of the test organisms with the

methods used in this study and perhaps produce metabolites with biological

82

activities not tested in this study (i.e., antiviral, antitumor, or anti-inflammatory
activities). In addition, genome analysis revealed that each Streptomyces species
have numerous biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of over
20 secondary metabolites (Hoskisson & Seipke, 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Liu et al.,
2021; Shentu et al., 2019), which are activated in very specific environmental
conditions (i.e., help them survive in various highly competitive habitats with
diverse microbial communities) (Lee et al., 2020; Williams & Vickers, 1986). Most
of these biosynthetic gene clusters are however cryptic or silent (i.e., poorly or not
expressed) under standard laboratory culture conditions (Becerril et al., 2018; Choi
et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Rutledge & Challis, 2015) as the
complex activating environmental and nutritional signals in natural habitats are
lacking and challenging to mimic in the laboratory (Lee et al., 2020; Rutledge &
Challis, 2015; Sung et al., 2017; Urem et al., 2016). Therefore, activation of these
cryptic and silent biosynthetic gene clusters to induce metabolites production may
be essential in drug discovery (Lee et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Rutledge & Challis,
2015). Recent developments in the activation of cryptic and silent biosynthetic
gene clusters in Streptomyces for the discovery of novel microbial secondary
metabolites include culture condition optimization (e.g., One Strain Many
Compounds [OSMAC] approach or modification of culture parameters such as
temperature, pH, media composition; identification of environmental signals; co-
culture with other microorganisms) and genomics, bioinformatics, and synthetic
biology strategies (i.e., genome mining; metabolomics; engineering of regulatory

networks such as ribosome, transcription factors, and promoters; heterologous

83

expression such as direct cloning, biosynthetic pathway reconstruction, and
chassis strain engineering) (Becerril et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2021;
Niu et al., 2018; Onaka, 2017; Rutledge & Challis, 2015; Shentu et al., 2019).
Similar to published literature (Goodfellow et al., 2012; Maleki et al., 2013;
Oliveros et al., 2021; Sapkota et al., 2020), Streptomyces with potent antimicrobial
activity were isolated from soil habitats at higher altitude (i.e., dumpsite, garden,
grassland, and riverside). Moreover, although the isolates with potent antimicrobial
activity have different phenotypic characteristics (Table 4.1), a comprehensive
study of Streptomyces species revealed that phenotypic traits appear to be not

linked to the taxonomic diversity of the genus (Labeda et al., 2017).

5.2. Molecular identification of Streptomyces isolates with antimicrobial

activity

The isolates with antimicrobial activity against the test organisms were
identified at the species level using molecular techniques. BLAST analysis of the
16S rRNA sequences of the Streptomyces isolates with antimicrobial activity
tevealed 94.20-99.93% sequence similarity with closely related Streptomyces
species on the database, which is in accordance with the phylogenetic analysis
results conducted using the MEGA 11 software. Figure 4.1 displays the
constructed phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary relationship of the
Streptomyces isolates with antimicrobial activity and their closely related
Streptomyces species. The Streptomyces species clustered into one major clade

in the phylogenetic tree. Presented on Table 5.1 are the reported secondary

84

metabolites produced by the Streptomyces species closely related to the
Streptomyces isolates with antimicrobial activity as well as their other

biotechnological applications.

!solate D4C30 is closely related to the thermophilic Streptomyces
thermocarboxydus strain NBRC 16323". Streptomyces thermocarboxydus has
been previously isolated from soil environments (Chi et al., 2013; Desjardin et al.,
2003; Guzman-Trampe et al., 2020; Kim et al., 1998; Tran et al., 2021), marine
sediments (Padri et al., 2022; Terahara et al., 2014), earthworm gut (Kim et al.,
2010), and as an endophyte (Passari et al., 2017). In this study, dumpsite isolate
D4C30 showed activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well
as Candida albicans. This is consistent with the study of Passari et al. (2017) who
reported the inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans by
Streptomyces thermocarboxydus through production of ketoconazole and
chebulagic acid, a promising anti-inflammatory (Reddy & Reddanna, 2009),
neuroprotective (Kim et al., 2014), and antiviral drug candidate (Li et al., 2020).
Streptomyces thermocarboxydus can also produce cyslabdan (Guzman-Trampe
et al., 2020), a labdane-like diterpenoid that potentiates the activity of imipenem
against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Fukumoto et al.,
2008). Moreover, different secondary metabolites have been synthesized from
Streptomyces thermocarboxydus that can be valuable in biotechnological
applications such as agricultural (e.g., plant growth promotion, biocontrol agent)
(Passari et al., 2017; Qin et al., 2021), industrial (e.g., food and feed additives,
biofuel production) (Chi et al., 2013; H-Kittikun et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2010; Tran
et al., 2021), and environmental applications (e.g., bioremediation) (Desjardin et

al., 2003; Padri et al., 2002; Terahara et al., 2014).

87

The grassland isolates GL3C6 and GL5C13 formed a clade with the
riverside isolate R5C7. These isolates have different antimicrobial activity against
the test organisms used in this study. Specifically, all are active against Gram-
positive bacteria. Isolate GL5C13 is also active against Escherichia coli, and
isolates GL5C13 and R5C7 inhibited the growth of Candida albicans. |solates
GL3C6, GL5C13, and R5C7 are closely related to Streptomyces resistomycificus
strain ISP 5133™ and Streptomyces hydrogenans strain NBRC 13475".
Streptomyces resistomycificus has been isolated from soil environments (Jakobi
& Hertweck, 2004; Roggo et al., 1994). It is known to produce the metabolites
resistomycin and resistoflavin. Resistomycin has been documented to inhibit
Gram-positive bacteria, mycobacteria, and HIV-1 protease (Brockmann &
Schmidt-Kastner, 1951; Haupt et al., 1975; Jakobi & Hertweck, 2004; Roggo et al.,
1994); it is also a potential therapeutic agent for megakaryoblastic leukemia, triple-
negative breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Han et al., 2021; Liu et al.,
2020; Shiono et al., 2002). Likewise, resistoflavin has been revealed to have
antibacterial and antiviral activities (Ishida et al., 2006; Kock et al., 2005) as well
as a candidate drug for hepatic carcinoma and gastric adenocarcinoma (Gorajana
et al., 2007). On the other hand, Streptomyces hydrogenans was isolated from
plant stem (Qin et al., 2012), marine sediments (Dos Santos et al., 2022), and soil
environments (Kaur & Manhas, 2014; Kulkarni et al., 2017; Nageswara et al., 2019:
Oubaha et al., 2018). Studies revealed that Streptomyces hydrogenans can
produce the metabolite actinomycin D, which showed activity against

mycobacteria, Escherichia coli, MRSA, and other Gram-positive bacteria (Chen et

88

al., 2012; Dos Santos et al., 2022; Kulkarni et al., 2017; Perry & Kelly, 1970;
Qureshi et al., 2021). Similarly, Streptomyces hydrogenans has been reported to
produce anti-inflammatory metabolites (Lindner et al., 1958; Nageswara et al.,
2019) and metabolites that can be used for bioremediation (Hosseini Abari et al.,
2021) and biocontrol of phytopathogens (Kaur & Manhas, 2014; Oubaha et al.,
2018; Sharma et al., 2020).

Dumpsite isolates D2C6 and D4C28 formed a clade with garden isolates
G1C18 and G1C44. Isolate D2C6 showed similarity to soil-derived Streptomyces
malachitofuscus strain NBRC 130597. It exhibited activity against Gram-negative
bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus. Previous research have established that
Streptomyces malachitofuscus can produce 6-chloronoboritomycin, a metabolite
that showed activity against Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes as well as the
causative agent of swine dysentery and malaria in mice (Dutton et al., 1995; Liu et
al., 1981; Rutkowski & Brzenzinski, 2013). However, isolate D2C6 did not show
activity against fungal test organisms. These findings are in agreement with Sajid
et al. (2011) who detected the activity of Streptomyces malachitofuscus against
Candida albicans only upon optimization of culture conditions (i.e., maximum
activities were observed after incubation at temperature of 35 °C on culture media
containing yeast extract, tryptone, and glucose). Previous studies have also
evaluated the importance of optimal culture conditions for the production of
secondary metabolites by Streptomyces (Law et al., 2018; Oskay, 2009; Sapkota

et al., 2020).

89

Isolates D4C28 and G1C18 displayed similarity to soil streptomycete
Streptomyces griseoflavus strain NBRC 13044'. Both isolates inhibited Gram-
positive bacteria, isolate G1C18 however also showed activity against Escherichia
coli. A considerable amount of research demonstrated that Streptomyces
griseoflavus produce several antimicrobials that are mainly active against bacteria
including acumycin (Clardy et al., 1981), aborycin (Shao et al., 2019), bicozamycin
(Ochi et al., 1988), ferrimycin (Page, 2019; Wencewicz & Miller, 2017), hormaomycin
(Cai et al., 2013; Héfer et al., 2011), picromycin (Hitter et al., 1961), pyrindicin
(Nakashima et al., 2017; Omura et al., 1974), streptomycin (Saito et al., 2003),
streptovirudin (Thrum et al., 1975), gilvocarcin V (Breiding-Mack & Zeeck, 1987;
Fischer et al., 2003), adenomycin (Efimtseva & Mikhailov, 2004), colabomycin A
(Grote & Zeeck, 1988), and okilactomycin (Imai et al., 1987). Gilvocarcin V,
adenomycin, colabomycin A, and okilatomycin have also been reported to exhibit
anticancer activities (Breiding-Mack & Zeeck, 1987; Efimtseva & Mikhailov, 2004;
Fischer et al., 2003; Grote & Zeeck, 1988, Imai et al., 1987). It can also produce
the anticancer diazepinomicin (Bonitz et al., 2013), neuroprotective agent
mescengricin (Shin-ya et al., 2000), and metabolites of industrial importance such
as alkaline protease (Hosseini et al., 2016) and laccase (Gabdulkhakov et al.,
2019).

Moreover, isolate G1C44 is closely related to soil Streptomyces
griseoloalbus strain NBRC 13046". It exhibited activity against Gram-positive
bacteria and Escherichia coli. Similar to the study of Mikulik and colleagues (2017)

who reported the antimicrobial activity of Streptomyces griseoloalbus against

90

MRSA. Streptomyces griseoloalbus has also been shown to produce the
antibacterial albomycin (Bauer & Hérmansdorfer, 2001; Wang et al., 2022) and
metabolites with biotechnological uses such as masikinolysin (Murao et al., 1994),
a-galactosidase (Anisha et al., 2009; Bhatia et al., 2020), and chitinase (Usuki et
al., 2006).

Dumpsite isolate D4C24 inhibited the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacteria. Interestingly, isolate D4C24 showed similarity to the
environmental isolate uncultured Streptomyces sp. clone D1. However, no
secondary metabolite production was reported for this environmental isolate. This
further supports the suggestion to investigate unexplored environments for the
discovery of diverse potential antimicrobial-producing microorganisms. Lastly, it is
early to speculate whether the isolated Streptomyces are novel species and might
have been isolated from different areas; additional molecular and chemotaxonomic
techniques are needed to establish the novelty of the isolates. Nevertheless, it can
be hypothesized that diverse secondary metabolites might be involved in the
antimicrobial activity of bioactive isolates considering their diverse phylogenetic

characteristics.

91

CHAPTER VI

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1. Conclusion

This study provided further evidence of the antimicrobial potential of
Streptomyces species isolated from diverse soil habitats in Calamba City, Laguna,
Philippines. Nine Streptomyces isolates showed significant inhibitory activity
against at least two test organisms; four were isolated from the dumpsite, two each
from garden and grassland, and one from the riverside. Bacteria, including
antimicrobial resistant strains (i.e, MRSA and ESBL-E. colli), were effectively
inhibited in contrast to fungi. Among the isolates, isolate D4C30 showed the most
noteworthy antimicrobial activity and inhibited almost all the test organisms.
Moreover, species level identification and phylogenetic analysis revealed the
diversity of these Streptomyces isolates. Therefore, this study suggests that soil
from Calamba City, Laguna, Philippines may be regarded as sustainable and rich
source of antimicrobial-producing Streptomyces. These Streptomyces isolates
may be considered as promising candidates for research and discovery of novel

antimicrobials to combat antimicrobial resistance.

6.2. Recommendations
Extensive studies are recommended to be conducted in the future to
discover antimicrobial-producing microorganisms from Calamba City, Laguna,

Philippines and other locations with similar characteristics. Moreover, additional

92

molecular (i.e., multilocus sequence analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization) and
chemotaxonomic (i.e., fatty acids analysis, cell wall composition, whole-cell
analysis) techniques may be used to establish the novelty of the isolated bioactive
Streptomyces. Since the bioactive metabolite/s responsible for inhibiting the test
organisms were not identified in this study, further purification and characterization,
optimization of antimicrobial production, and evaluation of antimicrobial activity
under controlled laboratory conditions are also needed. Multi-omics approach
including genomics, metagenomics, and metabolomics (Appendices 1.9 & 1.10)
may also be employed to obtain an in-depth understanding of the genome and
secondary metabolite profile of the bioactive strains. Lastly, we are joining the
International Consortium for Biosynthetic Diversity Research to further investigate
novel biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for biosynthesis of cryptic microbial

metabolites.
