ABSTRACT

The study was conducted to determine the interactive effects of variety and form of grain
sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) on growth performance, relative organ weights,
nutrient digestibility, and energy concentration in broilers. A total of 60 day-old (Cobb
500) broilers were used for the metabolic experiment. Birds were randomly allotted to 1 of
5 dietary treatments using a completely randomized design arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial
arrangements plus the basal diet. A corn-soybean meal basal diet and 4 diets were
formulated by mixing 70% of the basal diet with 30% (as-fed basis) of ground white
sorghum, whole white sorghum, ground red sorghum, and whole red sorghum,
respectively. Significant interaction (P = 0.01) between variety and form of grain sorghum
was observed only for F/G. Broilers fed with red grain sorghum have better F/G (P = 0.10)
compared with white grain sorghum when offered as whole grain, but both were not
significantly different from those fed ground sorghum and the corn-soy diet. Variety of sorghum grain did not affect LW of broiler at slaughter. Relative weight of gizzard and ' proventriculus were greater (P < 0.005) in broilers fed whole sorghum. ATTD of DM was
greater (P = 0.002) in diets with sorghum compared with the corn-soy diet regardless of
the variety and physical form of sorghum. The ATTD of CP tended to be lower (P < 0.001)
in the diet with white sorghum compared with red sorghum. The ATTD of GE and AME
of diet were not significantly affected by variety and form of sorghum grain. On DM basis,
the AME and AMEn of red and white sorghum (3,683 and 3,575 kcal/kg DM and 3,521
and 3,414 kcal/kg DM, respectively) and ground and whole sorghum (3,535 and 3,723
kcal/kg DM and 3,373 and 3,561 kcal/kg DM, respectively) were not significantly different
in broilers. The results have shown that variety of sorghum in growth performance is more
likely similar. It also shows that feeding whole sorghum grain stimulates gizzard activity
and development as implied by the increase in relative weight of gizzard. However, whole
grain feeding did not significantly improve energy utilization in broilers.

Key words: sorghum grain, broilers, growth performance, nutrient digestibility energy concentration

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

In the Philippines, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is primarily a major
source of bioethanol, but it can also provide for human food, livestock feed and forages,
and organic fertilizer. Its economic advantages and adaptability to a wide variety of
environmental conditions have received significant interest to boost its local production.
Nowadays, grain sorghum is considered one of the most attractive alternatives to yellow
corn especially when prices are high, supplies are low and when grain quality issues arise
that makes it unideal to use (Mateo and Carandang, 2006). The energy concentration in
grain sorghum is most likely similar to yellow corn, making it a good source of dietary
energy for poultry (Mateo and Carandang, 2006; _Etuk et al., 2012; Fernandes et al., 2013;
Liu et al., 2013). However, due to the tannin content in some sorghum varieties, its addition
to broiler diets may adversely affect the utilization of its energy value (Nyachoti et al.,
1996; Tapiwa, 2019). As a result, body weight gain and feed efficiency may be decreased
(Reyes Sanchez et al., 2000; Kumar et al., 2005). However, Nyachoti et al. (1996) and
Kumar et al. (2005) both reported that feed intake was increased when sorghum with high
tannin content was included in broiler diets.

Cereal grains, which are normally ground before it is incorporated into feed,
provide the majority of dietary energy to poultry. In any case, to reduce the cost of feed

incurred by transportation and processing, the use of whole grain has increased. According

to Gabriel et al. (2008), whole grain feeding has the potential to increase growth efficiency
in poultry, which may be attributed to changes in the digestive tract. The use of whole
sorghum grains in broiler rations, especially since grinding sorghum in the hammer mill is
difficult to accomplish, can potentially be advantageous in the feed manufacturing
standpoint. Whole grain-based broiler diets have gradually become a constant practice in
Brazil, Canada, Europe, and Australia, especially because of the known benefits present in
this form of feeding (Liu et al., 2014). However, there is limited data evaluating potential
interactions between the variety of grain sorghum and the form it is used in broiler diets.
Therefore, the objective of the study was to determine the interactive effects of variety and
form of grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) on growth performance, relative

organ weights, nutrient digestibility, and energy concentration in broilers.

CHAPTER II

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

Grain Sorghum

Sorghum [Sorghum bicolour (L.) Moench] is a cereal native to Africa that can
endure dry seasons, soil toxicities and temperature extremes more viably compared to
other cereals (Etuk et al., 2012). Global sorghum grain production is estimated to be 9.27
million metric tons planted in approximately 2.3 million ha (USDA-NASS, 2019). About
48% of the world’s grain sorghum production are used as feed ingredient for livestock and

poultry (Dowling et al., 2002).

Starch and energy in grain sorghum

Like yellow corn, grain sorghum is an energy source primarily for its high
concentration of non-structural carbohydrates. Starch is the most abundant component in
grain sorghum (70% on DM basis) with amylopectin, a highly branched polysaccharide
that makes up about 75% of the overall starch, and with amylose, a linear polysaccharide
accounting for the remaining 25% (Liu et al., 2015). However, utilization of starch in grain
sorghum grain as an energy source by broiler chickens seems to be inferior to that of
yellow corn (reference). Moss et al. (2020) offered corn, wheat and sorghum-based diets
to broiler chickens, and results showed that starch digestibility in the small intestine was

lowest when fed sorghum-based diets compared with those fed corn and wheat-based diets.

In contrast, Liu et al. (2014) using an in vivo experiment and Giuberti et al. (2012) using
an in vitro experiment, both observed that starch digestibility of corn starch was inferior to
sorghum starch. Liu et al. (2015) and Selle et al. (2018) reported that poor broiler
performance when offered sorghum meal may be due kafirin, polyphenols and phytate,
anti-nutritional factors present in sorghum. The levels of kafirin were observed to be
inversely related with the utilization of energy and this is because of its presence in starch
granules (Selle et al., 2018). According to Taylor (2005), kafirin decreases the digestibility
of starch by forming crosslinks. Additional factors affecting sorghum starch digestibility
are hardness and waxiness.

Hardness. Endosperm texture in grain sorghum refers to the fraction of corneous
(vitreous or hard), intermediate and floury or soft endosperm (Hikeezi, 2010). According
to Bryden et al. (2009), in comparison to soft endosperm which has protein that is more
soluble, the hard endosperm have more protein concentration including kafirins and
disulfide bonds. On the other hand, sorghum grain with floury endosperm texture produced
a richest starch than those corneous or intermediate endosperm texture (Norris and Rooney,
1970). Moreover, Cao et al. (1998) observed that broilers offered with soft sorghum-based
diets had better F/G (1.49 vs. 1.68) compared to those offered diets with sorghum
containing hard and medium endosperm.

Waxiness. Endosperm type of sorghum are classified as normal (non-waxy) or
waxy. Goldy (1987) reviewed that 25% amylose and 75% amylopectin can be seen in non-
waxy endosperm grain sorghum and made up about 100% of amylopectin is composed of

waxy type of endosperm. More digestible attribute and higher feeding efficiency can be

expected in sorghum with a waxy endosperm compared to a sorghum with normal (non-
waxy) endosperm (Kuhlman, 2005). Moreover, sorghum-based diets had AME of 13.70
MJ/kg DM, which was less compared to corn-based diets (15.21 MJ/kg) when fed to
broilers (Moss et al., 2020). This finding is consistent in the experiments performed by Liu

et al. (2014) and Kriegshauser et al. (2006).

Proteins in sorghum grain

Typically, sorghum contains more crude protein compared to corn (Heuzé et al.,
2015; Thomas et al., 2020). The protein concentration of grain sorghum varies, ranging
from 9 to 13% DM (Heuzé et al., 2015) with about 80%, 16%, and 3% of the protein found
in the endosperm (prolamin, glutelin), germ (albumin, globulin), and pericarp, respectively
(Taylor and Schiissler, 1986). In sorghum grain, prolamins is the major protein fraction
which is also called kafirin, followed by s Ga-glutelins (Bryden et al., 2009). Kafirins are
protein storage that build up within protein bodies, while glutelins are localized in the
protein matrix. About 70% of total protein in sorghum are compromised by kafirin

(Hamaker et al., 1995).

Comparison of white and red variety of grain sorghum

In a survey conducted by Liu et al. (2015), most animal nutritionists consider the
white variety of sorghum as superior to the red variety of sorghum. This observation was
supported by Selle et al. (2018), as they reported that the white sorghum variety are inferior
to the red sorghum variety, according to most respondents (60%) who firmly agreed. Liu

et al. (2015) and Selle et al. (2018) both reported that one possibility is that white variety

of grain sorghum manifest a less polyphenolic compound and phenolic acids compared to
red variety of grain sorghum; despite their perceived dominance as a feed ingredient for
pigs and poultry, this is of concern.

The chemical composition of both white and red varieties of sorghum as compared
with corn is shown in Table 1. On DM basis, the AMEn of white sorghum is slightly
greater (3,800 kcal/kg DM) compared to red varieties of sorghum (3,752 kcal/kg DM) but
both are greater than corn (3,561 kcal/kg DM). In contrast, Moss et al. (2020) observed
that corn has greater AMEn (3,549 kcal/kg DM) compared with either white (3,071 kcal/kg
DM) and red sorghum (3,066 kcal/kg DM) when fed to broilers.

Crude protein concentration in white sorghum is greater compared with red
sorghum (Table 1). However, Selle et al. (2013b) observed that the protein solubility of red
sorghum was higher (52.9%) compared with white sorghum (42.4%). Red sorghum also
contains higher phytate (0.88%) compared to white sorghum (0.81%). Selle et al. (2013a)
compared white sorghum that contained 98 g CP/kg DM with red sorghum that contained
121 g CP/kg DM in broiler chickens. In this experiment, a 3.2 mm screen size of hammer
mill were used in grinding sorghum and before it was incorporated to the feed, steam-
pelleting at 95°C conditioning temperature was performed. From 7 to 28 days post-hatch,
birds fed the white sorghum variety had 4.69% greater BWG (1,540 vs. 1,471 g/bird) and
2.88% better feed conversion efficiency (1.485 vs. 1.529) compared with birds fed the red
sorghum variety. Liu et al. (2013) and Selle et al. (2013a) mentioned that the substantially

higher potential of greater starch digestibility in white sorghum may help explain the

improved broiler chicken performance. This may also be due to the lower phytic acid
content and tannins relative to red varieties of sorghum.

In the same experiment, relative gizzard weights were observed to be 18.3% greater
in birds fed the red sorghum-based diet (19.4 vs 16.4 g/kg BW) compared with those fed
the white sorghum-based diet, even though both sorghum varieties were ground through
the same particle size (3.2 mm). This finding was consistent with Selle et al. (2013b). which
use 2.0 mm hammer mill size to grind sorghum prior to incorporation to the broiler diets.
This may be due to red sorghum containing lower particle size index (7%), which has
harder texture compared to white sorghum with 12 % particle size index. The hard texture
of red sorghum gives gizzard more effort and time to grind, that may result to heavier

weights.

Tannins in Grain Sorghum

Another characteristic of sorghum over other cereals is its tannin content. Red sorghum
contains slightly higher tannins compared with white sorghum (Table 1). Sorghum
varieties can be classified on the basis of its tannin concentration: low, <0.2%; medium,
0.2-0.6%; and high, >0.6% (Catalin, 2016). As extensively reviewed by Tapiwa (2019),
tannin is considered one of the major anti-nutritional factor influencing the nutritional
value of grain sorghum. There are also two types of tannins based on its effect on animals:
hydrolysable and condensed tannins. Hydrolysable tannins have a sugar alcohol at their
core which are partly, or completely, esterified with either gallic or hexahydroxydiphenic

acid. Hydrolysable tannins will be hydrolyzed by acid or enzyme into their subunit

phenolic acids and sugars. Condensed tannins are polymers are formed by the condensation
flavan-3-ols. Monomeric tannins are usually linked by C=C bonds between carbon-4 and
carbon-8 of two flavan-3-ols. Formed bond are highly stable and require heating with
strong acids to catabolize them.

Sorghum tannins have detrimental effects on voluntary feed consumption,
digestibility, and growth performance. One of the main nutrients that tannins impair is
protein digestibility, as they bind and precipitate protein, making them unavailable during
digestion (Heuzé et al., 2015).

There are two types of sorghum: the bird-resistant or high tannin sorghum and the
non-bird-resistant or low tannin sorghum. In previous literature, low tannin sorghum are
considered to be more suitable as feed grain to broiler chickens since growth performance
is unaffected when it is incorporated as partial or complete replacement of corn in the diet
(Mateo and Carandang, 2006; Manyelo et al., 2019; Puntigam et al., 2020). Moreover,
Saleh et al. (2019) reported that feeding low tannin sorghum to broilers can significantly

improve body weight.

Effect of tannins on energy and protein digestibilities

Tannins in sorghum grain are also known for its effect to reduce protein,
carbohydrate, and energy utilization due to inhibition of the activity of amylase enzymes
(Tapiwa, 2019). Feeding high tannin sorghum to broilers increased feed intake, but
significantly reduced ME, suggesting that the higher consumption of feed is an effort of
the birds to make up for the lower availability of energy (Nyachoti et al., 1996; Kumar et

al. 2005). However, Manyelo et al. (2019) reported that low tannin white sorghum with

levels of tannin from 0.03, 0.06, and 0.09% improved ME significantly in broilers
compared to corn.

Increasing levels of tannins in sorghum-based diets was observed to negatively
affect protein digestibility. This may be due to the effect of tannins to reduce both dietary
protein availability and digestives enzymes (El-Zubeir and Gibril, 2002). This was
consistent with the findings of Elkin et al. (1996) and Ojediran et al. (2018), that reported
that energy and digestibility has an indirect relationship with the concentration of tannins
in grain sorghum. In contrast, Garcia et al. (2004) observed that sorghum with high tannin

and low tannin content have no significant effects on crude protein digestibility.

Effect of tannins on broiler performance

Tannins are responsible for the bitter taste of the feed, which leads to lower feed
consumption due to decreased palatability (Butler et al., 1984). Tannins has been studied
extensively in its effect on consumption of feed and growth of chickens (Chang and Fuller,
1964; Armstrong et al., 1973; Reyes Sanchez et al., 2000; Hassan et al., 2003; Kumar et
al.. 2005). All these authors reported that tannins in poultry diets will result in growth
retardation and reduction in feed intake. However, consumption of dietary tannin did not
affect the weights of digestive organs of broilers, implying that digestive organ hypertrophy

is not a factor in adaptation (Nyachoti et al., 1996; Medugu et al., 2010).

Feed particle size and broiler nutrition

Cereal grains, which are normally ground before it is incorporated into feed,

provide the majority of dietary energy to poultry. In any case, to reduce the cost of feed


incurred by transportation and processing, the use of whole grain has increased. According
to Gabriel et al. (2008), whole grain feeding has the potential to increase growth efficiency
in poultry, which may be attributed to changes in the digestive tract. As reviewed by
Amerah et al. (2007), mechanoreceptors in the beak help birds to differentiate between
different sizes of feed particles. Larger feed particles are preferred by chickens of all ages,
and this preference is thought to increase with age. This idea can be linked to the bird’s
‘gape’ (beak width) becoming larger as it gets older. For ideal performance of poultry, it is
possible as beak width increases with age, the particle size needs to be larger.

According to Svihus (2014), the small intestine of birds is the primary site for
nutrient digestion and absorption. Intestinal villi are important part of this organ, causing
the food surface contact to increase allowing more nutrients to be absorbed. The anatomy
and histology of digestive tract, and thus the nutrient absorption process, are influenced by
the physical and chemical characteristics of the feed ingredient (Ariyadi et al., 2019).
Moreover, when broilers are fed with mash feed instead of pelleted feed, the particle size
of the feed gives a greater impact on gastrointestinal tract growth and performance of the
broiler (Zaefarian et al., 2016). As a result, the functional and nutritional consistency in
terms of quality feed ingredient is determined by the integrity of the intestinal tissue

structure (Silva et al., 2015).

Feed particle size: effects on broiler performance
In poultry nutrition, grinding is needed for the majority of the feed ingredients.
Douglas et al. (1990) and Nir et al. (1995) indicated that grinding of feed ingredients

increase its surface area, allowing more interactivity among digesta and digestive enzymes,


improving pellet quality and mixing uniformity, and reducing segregation after mixing.
The grinding process mostly requires the use of either roller or hammer mill that makes an
intact kernel to be in a smaller particle size. However, grinding process of feed ingredient
may increase production cost since it uses electrical energy. The use of whole sorghum
grains in broiler rations can generate great savings in the production cost. Whole grain-
based broiler diets have gradually become a constant practice in Brazil, Canada, Europe,
and Australia, especially because of the known benefits present in this form of feeding (Liu
et al., 2014).

Fernandes et al. (2013) conducted an experiment in the use of sorghum diets in the
form of ground, partially ground or whole and including corn in the form of ground and
broken in broiler chickens. Feed consumption, live weight, F/G, and livability of 42-day-
old broilers were not affected by the experimental diets. However, female broilers fed with
partially ground and whole sorghum was significantly better compared when feeding
ground corn. Moreover, Garcia et al. (2013) also observed no significant differences in the
growth performance of broilers fed with increasing levels of sorghum (ground and
unground) compared to corn. Selle et al. (2019) fed 7 to 28 day-old broilers with diets
containing grain sorghum of various particle sizes using different hammer mill panel sizes

(2.0, 3.2, 4.8, and 6.0 mm) and found that particle size had no effect on BWG and F/G.

Feed particle size: effects on broiler digestive organs
Feed particle size has been shown to affect the development of the digestive tract
in poultry, especially the gizzard (Amerah et al., 2007). According to Fernandes et al.

(2013), there was a substantial increase in gizzard and small intestine weight of broilers


when 50 or 100% whole sorghum grain was used in the diets. Sorghum particle size had
no impact on ceca. Additionally, Silva et al. (2015) also found a significant increase in
gizzard weight when fed with diets containing whole sorghum. Dahlke et al. (2003)
observed that the increase in the weight of gizzard increased linearly with particle size.
This may elaborate the function of the GI tract in birds: the larger the size of a particle led
to increase in gizzard activity, which increase pancreatic secretions via cholecystokinin,
due to greater work in reducing the particle size. Thus, Carre (2000) and Svihus (2011)
mentioned that extending the time when nutrients are exposed to digestive enzymes, it
potentially enhance energy consumption and digestibility of nutrients. Moreover, ina study
of the effect of grain particle size on broiler gizzard weight at 21 days (Rodgers et al.,
2012), it was concluded that when the animals were fed whole grain, the gizzard weight
was higher. It also found that sorghum ground into 1 mm hammer mill screen size
significantly increased size of the proventriculus but the gizzard size was decreased.

The relative weight of other digestive organs, such as the liver, when 42-day old
broilers were fed ground corn was observed to be significantly higher compared to when
ground sorghum was given. However, the treatment containing whole sorghum was the
same as the other diets (Svihus 2011). In the experiment of Selle et. al. (2019) and Svihus
(2011), the weight of the pancreas was not affected by feed particle size. Additionally,
length of small intestine and ceca are also not influenced by the size of the feed particle

(Jones and Taylor, 2001; Svihus, 2011; Fernandes et al., 2013).

Determination of ME values

Metabolizable energy (ME) is the most frequently used energy system in broilers
because the feces and urine are excreted together. A more commonly used term is apparent
metabolizable energy (AME), and this is the energy that the animal utilizes without
accounting for endogenous energy losses. At present, the nitrogen corrected apparent
metabolizable energy (AMEn) has been the basis in formulating broiler diets, which is a
common way to represent the energy composition of feed ingredient (Barzegar et al.,
2019). Precise estimation of AMEn values of feed ingredient are important for accurate
diet formulation and reducing feed costs.

Concentration of AMEn in feed ingredients for broilers can be determined through
in vivo metabolism experiments (Sibbald and Slinger, 1963; Alvarenga et al., 2011), using
either the direct method where the test feed ingredient offer the main supply of energy, or
by the indirect method which the test feed ingredient is offered as a fraction of the dietary
treatment. Those two methods, according to Anderson et al. (1958), Sibbald and Slinger
(1963) and Sibbald (1976) mentioned that consumption of feed and total production of
excreta are frequently determined over the same time span using the balance procedure.
However, in vivo metabolic assays is often lengthy, consume large amount of labor and
costly in measuring the energy values of feedstuffs. Alternatively, prediction equations
based on chemical composition of feed ingredient have been used by many researchers in
determining the energy values of feed ingredient for broiler (Nascimento et al., 2009;

Alvarenga et al., 2011; Nascimento et al., 201 1a,b; Alvarenga et al., 2015).

Prediction equation of sorghum AMEn

Using the periodical tables of chemistry and composition of energy for sorghum
derived from static sources such as reference books (e.g., NRC publications) and research
publications, is a possible cause of errors in formulating diets, since the values are an
average of many quantities from past animal experiments. Therefore, it is more accurate to
use prediction equations in estimating the metabolizable energy of sorghum given that
chemical composition of feed ingredient has been used. There are limited data on the
equations specific to predict the AMEn of grain sorghum. However, there are some of
proposed prediction equations generally used for energy and protein source feed
ingredients shown in Table 4. The most significant predictors for AMEn equation were
ether extract, ash, NDF and ADF. Reported by Nascimento (2007), as cited by Alvarenga
et al. (2011) stated that neutral detergent fiber (NDF) values are important in predicting
the equations for AMEn, as this predictor variable are removed in the databank, the
generated equation resulted to a reduction of R? from 81% to 71%. Carre et al. (1984)
indicated that other variables in feed ingredients should be accounted for developing
predictiion equations because of its specific importance and functions. For example, NDF,
its crucial and its responsible proportion of feed ingredient comprising the cellulose and
lignin, which have low digestible in birds. However, in broilers, NDF should not contain
all undigestible carbohydrates. (e.g., pectic substance in the cell wall).

In addition, ether extract can be one of the important variables for developing
prediction equations, which is responsible for the energy variability in feedstuffs

(Alvarenga et al., 2011). Nunes et al. (2001), using equation to predict energy content in


wheat including its by-products offered to broilers, found that crude fat had a positive
correlation with ME values. Findings of high energy values can be linked to crude fat in
different composition of the feed ingredient. Furthermore, Garnsworthy et al. (2000)
mentioned that ash is additionally one of the crucial predictor variables in the equation in
order to predict accurate estimation of energy values of feed ingredient for broilers because
it inversely represents the organic matter in the feed ingredient. Alvarenga et al. (2011)
emphasized that thru this conclusion, leading to an explanation why general equation
concentrate feed ingredients have shown to be more accurate in predicting AMEn values
for protein ingredients.

Alvarenga et al. (2015) conducted a validation of prediction equations of AMEn of
feed ingredient for broilers, the AMEn values obtained using the tables and chemical
composition, prediction equation in vivo assay are presented in Table 4. The proposed
general equation of Mariano et al. (2012) adequately predicts the estimated AMEn values
in feed ingredient and dietary treatment to the lowest estimated standard error at all broiler
chicken growth phases. It has shown that the AMEn = 4,164.187+51.006EE-197.663ash—
35.689CF-20.593NDF predicted more accurate AMEn values, especially when compared

to Rostagno et al. (2011) tables.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals and Experimental Design

A total of 60 day-old (Cobb 500) straight-run broilers were used for the experiment.
Birds were group-brooded and fed a commercial chick booster diet for 12 d; afterwards,
the birds were randomly allotted to 1 of 5 dietary treatments using a completely randomized
design arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement plus the basal diet. Each broiler was housed
in a metabolic cage (50 x 60 cm) that allowed for total collection of excreta captured on
aluminum trays directly beneath each cage. Each cage was equipped with 1 trough feeder

and | waterer. There were 12 replicate cages with | broiler per replicate cage.

Experimental Diets

A total of five experimental diets were prepared (Table 3). The first diet was a corn-
soybean meal diet that served as the basal diet. The next 4 diets were formulated by mixing
70% of the basal diet with 30% (as-fed basis) of ground white sorghum, whole white
sorghum, ground red sorghum, and whole red sorghum, respectively. Crystalline amino
acids, limestone, inorganic phosphate, vitamins, and minerals were added to the diets to
meet or exceed NRC (1994) requirements for growing broilers. All the experimental diets

were in meal form.

Feeding and Excreta Collection

Birds were fed a common diet for 12 d (Figure 2). Afterwards, birds were weighed
and placed on the cages after a 4-h fast. The experimental diets were fed from d 13 to 22
post-hatch. The first 7 days (day 13 to 19) served as adaptation period to the diets and cage.
The balance period started on d 20 after a 17-h fast until d 22. Total collection of excreta
was performed every 24 h during the balance period. On the last day (d 22), birds were
fasted for 17 h and weighed after fasting. Daily excreta collections within a cage was

pooled, weighed, and stored at -20°C for subsequent analyses.

Chemical analysis

At the end of the experiment, excreta samples were thawed and mixed within bird
and diet, lyophilized, and a sub-sample was used for chemical analysis. Excreta samples
were dried in a hot air oven and finely ground prior to use for chemical analysis. Samples
of ingredients, diet, and excreta were analyzed in duplicates for DM by oven drying at
135°C for 2h (method 930.15; AOAC, 2007), CP (method 990.03; AOAC, 2007), and GE

using bomb calorimetry (Model 6200, Parr Instruments, Moline, IL). Samples of ingredient


were also analyzed in triplicates for crude fiber (method 978.10; AOAC, 2007), ether

extract (method 920.39; AOAC 2007) and ash (method 942.05; AOAC, 2007).

Energy Calculations

The AME of the basal diet were determined using the direct procedure whereas the
AME in grain sorghum was determined using the difference procedure. The AME of the

diet was calculated using the following equation:

AME _ (Feed intake x GEfeeq) — (Excreta output X GEexcreta)
Total feed intake

Correction for zero N retention was made using a factor of 8.22 kcal per g N
retained in the body (Sauvant et al., 2004). Nitrogen-corrected AME (AME,) were

calculated using the following equations:

gain x 8.22)

AMEn = AME — ee (6W gain x 0.20)

|, where:|N gain = 6.235

Digestibility Calculations

The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD, %) of DM, CP and GE were

calculated using the following equation:

[Nutrient; — Nutrient |

x 100
Nutrient;

ATTD (%) =


where ATTD is the apparent total tract digestibility, Nutrient; is the total nutrient intake (g)
from d 8 to d 10; and Nutrientr is the total fecal output (g) of the nutrient originating from

the diet fed from d 8 to d 10 (Almeida and Stein, 2010).

Relative Organ Weights

At the end of the experiment, birds were fasted for 12 h, then weighed and
transported to the IAS Meat Science Research Laboratory. Birds were killed by cutting the
jugular vein, scalded, plucked and eviscerated. The abdominal fat was removed from the
abdomen and the gizzard, proventriculus, small intestine, large intestine, ceca, liver and
pancreas were weighed immediately after evisceration using a precision digital scale (0.01
g). The length of the small intestine and ceca of each bird were measured using a standard
ruler. Relative weight was calculated relative to the bird BW at slaughter and expressed as

a percentage.

Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC) with bird as experimental unit. The model included variety, form, and their interaction
as fixed effects and replicate as random effect. When comparisons were made with the
corn-soy basal treatment, a second model was tested with diet as the fixed effect and
replicate as random effect. Least square means were calculated for each independent
variable. When diet is a significant source of variation, least square means were separated

using PDIFF option of SAS and adjusted Tukey-Kramer test. The a-level that were used

to determine significance and tendencies between means were <0.05 and <0.10,

respectively.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION

Chemical composition of red and white sorghum

Ona DM basis, CP, and GE in white sorghum were 12.61% and 4,502 kcal/kg DM.
respectively, which were greater than the CP and GE in red sorghum (9.79% and 4,315
kcal/kg DM; Table 4). However, these values were within the range of published values

for both white and red sorghum (Selle et al., 2013a, 2013b; Heuze et al., 2015; Espinosa et

al., 2019; Mohammed et al., 2019; Thomas et al., 2020). Analyzed composition of ether
extract, crude fiber, and ash in white sorghum were 3.11%, 7.57%, and 2.16% respectively,
while red sorghum contained 3.23%, 6.25%, and 1.32%, respectively. Published values for
ether extract and ash in white sorghum range from 2.6-5.0% and 1.5-2.9% respectively,

and red sorghum range from 2.9-4.4 and 1.4-2.6%, respectively (Heuze et al., 2015) and

the analyzed values obtained in this experiment are within these ranges. However, crude
fiber of both white and red sorghum used in the experiment were greater than previously

published values (Heuze_et al., 2015; Mohammed et al., 2019).

Effect on broiler performance

Effect of variety and form of grain sorghum on growth performance of 13 to 23-
day-old broilers are shown in Table 5 and 6. Significant interaction (P = 0.01) between
variety and form of grain sorghum was only observed in F/G. Red grain sorghum have
better F/G (P = 0.10) than white grain sorghum when offered whole, but both were not
significantly different from those fed ground sorghum and the corn-soy diet. This may be
due to white sorghum having harder endosperm as implied by the observed increase in
relative weight of the gizzard. It is possible that due to the hardness of the endosperm,
broilers sort through the feed which uses more energy and negatively affect F/G. Broilers
fed red sorghum ground had greater (P<0.05) feed intake compared to corn-soy diet, but

to both were not significantly different to white sorghum ground. However, when fed


whole sorghum had lower feed intake than corn-soy diet regardless of the variety of
sorghum. White sorghum whole fed to broilers had the lower (P = 0.002) BWG compared
from those fed corn-soy diet and other sorghum diet. Final weight of broiler fed sorghum
diet were not significantly different to corn-soy diet
No significant differences were observed in feed intake, BWG, and final weight between
the variety of grain sorghum. This results in agreement with the findings of Liu et. al.,
(2016). This may be explained that it’s not affected by the tannin content, However,
mechanisms by which tannins influence feed intake are not clearly known because taste
sharpness in chicken is not well developed. It seems unlikely the taste effect by tannin plays
a role in decreasing feed intake.

Form of grain sorghum had significant effects (P < 0.001) on feed intake, BWG
and final weight. Broilers had greater (P < 0.001) feed intake, which resulted in greater (P
< 0.001) BWG and final weight, when sorghum was fed ground rather than whole. These
results are in contrast with those observed by Selle et. al. (2013a), where they compared
white and red grain sorghum fed to broilers from 7 to 28 days post-hatch. Birds fed the diet
with white grain sorghum had significantly greater BWG and had improved feed
conversion efficiency (1.485 vs. 1.529) compared to those fed the diet containing red
sorghum. Liu et al. (2015) and Selle et al. (2018) proposed that white sorghum was superior
to red sorghum due to possibly higher potential of greater starch digestibility in white
sorghum that may result to improved broiler performance. Additionally, white sorghum
usually has less tannin content (Ojediran et al., 2018; Thomas et al., 2020). Tannin is an

anti-nutritional factor in sorghum which impairs protein digestibility, as they bind and


precipitate protein, making them unavailable during digestion (Heuzé et. al., 2015) and
eventually affects growth performance and digestibility of other nutrients. However,
interestingly, the current study showed that broilers fed red sorghum may perform just as
well as those fed white sorghum.

The results of the current experiment indicated that the form of grain sorghum
added to the diet may significantly influence growth performance. Rodger et al. (2012) also
observed poorer (P < 0.05) BWG when whole sorghum was offered to broilers, however,
they also observed poorer F/G compared with those fed ground sorghum which was not
observed in the present study. In contrast, other studies observed no effect of particles size
(whole and ground) of grain sorghum on broiler growth performance (Fernandes et al.,

2013; Garcia et al., 2013; Silva et al., 2015; Selle et al., 2019).

Effect on relative organ weights

Effect of variety and form of grain sorghum on relative organ weights of broilers
are shown in Table 7 and 8. Live weight of broiler at slaughter fed sorghum diet were
significantly different to corn-soy diet. Relative weight of gizzard was greater (P = 0.01)
when offered whole white sorghum than to corn-soy diet, but other sorghum diet was not
significantly different to corn-soy diet. This may be explained by its larger size and
hardness of endosperm of white sorghum that promote muscle hypertrophy in the gizzard
because of the effort to reduce the particle size. Broiler fed sorghum diet tended (P =
0.0001) to have lower absolute (P = 0.003) and relative (P = 0.0001) weight of
proventriculus than corn-soy diet. Contrast with the study by Silva et al., (2015) that
observed no effect.

The lower absolute (P = 0.05) and relative weight (P = 0.07) of small intestine may
be related to shorter (P = 0.05) length of small intestine fed red sorghum whole than corn-
soy diet. This may be explained by the low feed intake of this diet which could have limited
nutrient to utilize. Sorghum diet fed to broiler tended to lower large intestine absolute
weight (P = 0.09) and relative weight (P = 0.03) compared to corn-soy diet, except white
sorghum ground and white sorghum whole were not significantly different to corn-soy diet
for the absolute and relative weight of large intestine, respectively. There are no differences
found in absolute weight of liver when broiler fed sorghum diet compared to corn-soy diet.
Dietary treatment did not affect weight of ceca at pancreas which in agreement in the study

of Silva et al., (2015).


Live weight at slaughter were not significantly different between broilers fed diets
with white and red sorghum. There were no significant differences in absolute weight of
the gizzard, but broilers fed white sorghum tended (P = 0.06) to have greater relative weight
of the gizzard compared with those fed red sorghum. Likewise, broilers fed white sorghum
had greater (P < 0.01) relative weight of the proventriculus and small intestine compared
with those fed red sorghum. The greater relative weight of the small intestine may be
related to the longer (P = 0.03) small intestine observed in broilers fed white sorghum
(Table 8). No significant differences were observed in both absolute and relative weight of
the ceca and liver between broilers fed white and red sorghum. Ceca length was not
influenced by variety of grain sorghum. However, absolute weight of the pancreas tended
(P = 0.06) to be greater for those fed white sorghum compared with those fed red sorghum.

Live weight at slaughter of broilers fed ground sorghum were greater (P < 0.001)
than those fed whole sorghum. Absolute weight of the gizzard and proventriculus were not
significantly different between broilers fed ground and whole sorghum; however, relative
weight of these digestive organs was greater (P < 0.005) in broilers fed whole sorghum.
Absolute weight of the small intestine, liver and pancreas were also greater (P < 0.03) in
broilers fed whole sorghum compared with those fed ground sorghum but there were no
significant differences were observed in relative weights. Likewise, there were no
significant differences in both absolute and relative weight of the ceca between broilers fed
ground and whole sorghum. Length of the small intestine was not affected by the form of
grain sorghum in the diet; however, broilers fed whole sorghum tended (P = 0.06) to have

shorter ceca than those fed ground sorghum.


Fernandes et al. (2013) found that inclusion of 50% or 100% of whole grair
sorghum in the diet resulted in a significant increase in gizzard weight of 21 day ol
broilers. Rodgers et al. (2012) and Silva et al. (2015) had similar observations, whicl
agrees with the results of the current study. Dahlke et al. (2003) suggested that the
significant increase in weight of the gizzard was linearly related with particle size. Large
particle size of the feed ingredient stimulates muscle hypertrophy in the gizzard due to thi
greater mechanical action and length of time in the gizzard to reduce particle size.

The observed effect on the relative weight of the proventriculus when fed whol
sorghum was in contrast with the observations of Rodger et al. (2012). In their study
feeding sorghum ground through 1 mm sieve in a hammer mill significantly increasec
proventriculus weight compared to broilers fed a diet with whole sorghum. This i:
supported by the study of Zaefarian et al. (2016), where finer to medium particle size o
corn and wheat increased proventriculus weight.

The greater weight of small intestine, liver and pancreas observed in broilers fec
whole sorghum was in contrast with the results of previous studies (Silva et al., 2015; Sell
et. al., 2019), where no significant effects where observed with physical form of sorghum
Fernandes et al. (2013), measured liver and small intestine weight in 42-day old broiler

fed with whole and ground sorghum and found no significant differences.

Physical form of grain sorghum did not affect length of the small intestine. This
conformed with the results of Jones and Taylor (2001) and Fernandes et al. (2013).
However, small intestine length increased significantly when broilers were fed with the
white variety of grain sorghum. There is limited information on the effect of variety of
sorghum in length of the small intestine. However, tannin content of sorghum has been
previously shown to have no influence on the length of small intestine of broilers (Nyachoti

et. al., 1996; Garcia et al., 2005).

Daily DM and CP balance

Average daily feed intake of broilers was unaffected by variety of grain sorghum
(Table 11). This result confirms by Liu et al., (2016). Sorghum variety did not influence
daily DM intake, DM excreted, and ATTD of DM. Broilers fed diets with ground, red
sorghum had greater (P = 0.003) DM intake than those fed the corn-soy diet, but lower
when red sorghum is fed whole (Table 12). The amount of DM excreted was less (P <
0.001) than those fed the corn-soy diet when sorghum was fed whole regardless of the
variety but were similar when fed ground sorghum. The ATTD of DM was greater (P =
0.002) in diets with sorghum compared with the corn-soy diet regardless of the variety and

physical form of sorghum.

Feeding white sorghum to broilers resulted in greater (P < 0.001) amount of
excreted CP compared with those fed the diet with red sorghum despite having similar CP

intake. As a result, ATTD of CP tended to be lower (P < 0.001) in the diet with white


sorghum compared with red sorghum. This is supported by the findings of Selle et al.

(2013b), where they observed lower protein solubility in white sorghum (42.4%) compared

with red sorghum (52.9%). Bryden et al. (2009) also indicated that protein content in the
soft endosperm is more soluble than hard endosperm, which has higher protein that
contains kafirins.

Broilers fed ground sorghum had greater (P < 0.001) ADFI than those fed whole
sorghum. This was similar to the observation of Fagundes et al. (2019) where broilers fed
diet with ground sorghum significantly improved feed intake. However, Fernandes et
al. (2013) found no significant differences in ADFI of 21-day old broilers when fed either
ground or whole sorghum. Broilers fed the diet with ground sorghum also had greater (P <
0.002) daily CP intake and excretion. However, physical form of grain sorghum did not
significantly affect ATTD of CP when fed to broilers. Broilers fed the diets with sorghum
tended (P = 0.07) to have greater ATTD of CP compared with the corn-soy diet regardless
of variety and physical form. This may be explained by the GE concentration in sorghum

diets which is higher compared to corn-soy diets.

Daily energy balance

Broilers fed red sorghum and white sorghum tended (P = 0.0001) to have lesser GE
excreted compared to corn soy diet despite having similar GE intake. This may be
explained by the length of grinding whole grain in gizzard that could increase exposure
time of nutrients with digestive enzymes. Therefore, resulted to higher (p<0.001) ATTD

of GE to corn-soy diet.


There were no significant differences observed in daily GE intake, GE excreted,
ATTD of GE and AME of diets containing either white or red sorghum (Table 13). Broilers
fed the diet with ground sorghum had greater (P < 0.001) daily GE intake and excretion
compared with those fed the diet with whole sorghum. However, ATTD of GE and AME
were not significantly affected by physical form of sorghum added to the diet. However,
diets with grain sorghum had greater (P < 0.001) AME concentration compared to the corn-

soy basal diet regardless of variety and physical form (Table 14).

Energy concentration in grain sorghum

On both as fed and DM basis, there were no significant differences in the AME and
AMEn of sorghum regardless of variety and physical form of grain sorghum in the diet
(Table 15). On DM basis. the AME and AMEn of red and white sorghum was 3,683 and
3.575 kcal/kg DM and 3.521 and 3,414 kcal/kg DM, respectively. Although energy values
of red sorghum grain were numerically greater than white sorghum. This could be due to
high crude fiber content of white sorghum compared to red sorghum. The AME and AMEn
of ground and whole sorghum was 3,535 and 3,723 kcal/kg DM and 3,373 and 3,561
kcal/kg DM, respectively. Values measured in the present experiment were within the
range of previously published values for grain sorghum (AMEn: 3,441 — 3,800 kcal/kg

DM: Sauvant et al., 2004; Heuze et al., 2015; CVB, 2016; Rostagno et al., 2017).

CHAPTER V

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

The objective of the study was to determine the interactive effects of variety and
form of grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) on growth performance, relative
organ weights, nutrient digestibility, and energy concentration in broilers. A total of 60
broiler chicks were randomly distributed to 1 of 5 experimental treatments using a
completely randomized design arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangements plus the basal
diet. Each treatment had 12 replicates. The first diet was a corn-soybean meal diet that
served as the basal diet. The next 4 diets were formulated by mixing 70% of the basal diet
with 30% (as-fed basis) of ground white sorghum, whole white sorghum, ground red
sorghum, and whole red sorghum, respectively. The AME and AMEn in grain sorghum
was determined using the difference procedure.

Results were as follows:

1. Significant interaction (P = 0.01) between variety and form of grain sorghum

was only observed in F/G. Broilers fed with red grain sorghum have better F/G
(P = 0.10) compared with white grain sorghum when offered whole, but both
were not significantly different from those fed ground sorghum and the corn-
soy diet.

2. No significant differences were observed in feed intake, BWG, and final weight

between the variety of grain sorghum.

Broilers had greater (P < 0.001) feed intake, which resulted in greater (P <
0.001) BWG and final weight, when sorghum was fed ground rather than whole.
Live weight at slaughter was not significantly different between broilers fed
diets with white and red sorghum.

There were no significant differences in absolute weight of the gizzard. but
broilers fed white sorghum tended (P = 0.06) to have greater relative weight of
the gizzard compared with those fed red sorghum.

Broilers fed white sorghum had greater (P < 0.01) relative weight of the
proventriculus and small intestine compared with those fed red sorghum.

The greater relative weight of the small intestine may be related to the longer
(P = 0.03) small intestine observed in broilers fed white sorghum.

No significant differences were observed in both absolute and relative weight
of the ceca and liver between broilers fed white and red sorghum.

Ceca length was not influenced by variety of grain sorghum.

Absolute weight of the pancreas tended (P = 0.06) to be greater for those fed

white sorghum compared with those fed red sorghum.

_ Live weight at slaughter of broilers fed ground sorghum were greater (P<

0.001) than those fed whole sorghum.

Absolute weight of the gizzard and proventriculus were not significantly
different between broilers fed ground and whole sorghum; however, relative
weight of these digestive organs was greater (P < 0.005) in broilers fed whole

sorghum.

. Absolute weight of the small intestine, liver and pancreas were also greater (P

< 0.03) in broilers fed whole sorghum compared with those fed ground sorghum

but there were no significant differences were observed in relative weights.

. There were no significant differences in both absolute and relative weight of

the ceca between broilers fed ground and whole sorghum.

. Length of the small intestine was not affected by the form of grain sorghum in

the diet; however, broilers fed whole sorghum tended (P = 0.06) to have shorter
ceca than those fed ground sorghum.
Average daily feed intake of broilers was unaffected by variety of grain

sorghum.

. Sorghum variety did not influence daily DM intake, DM excreted, and ATTD

of DM.

Broilers fed diets with ground, red sorghum had greater (P = 0.003) DM intake
than those fed the corn-soy diet, but lower when red sorghum is fed whole.
The amount of DM excreted was less (P < 0.001) than those fed the corn-soy
diet when sorghum was fed whole regardless of the variety but were similar
when fed ground sorghum.

The ATTD of DM was greater (P = 0.002) in diets with sorghum compared
with the corn-soy diet regardless of the variety and physical form of sorghum.
Feeding white sorghum to broilers resulted in greater (P < 0.001) amount of
excreted CP compared with those fed the diet with red sorghum despite having

similar CP intake.

The ATTD of CP tended to be lower (P < 0.001) in the diet with white sorghum
compared with red sorghum.

There were no significant differences observed in daily GE intake, GE excreted,
ATTD of GE and AME of diets containing either white or red sorghum.
Broilers fed the diet with ground sorghum had greater (P < 0.001) daily GE
intake and excretion compared with those fed the diet with whole sorghum.
The ATTD of GE and AME were not significantly affected by physical form of
sorghum added to the diet.

Diets with grain sorghum had greater (P < 0.001) AME concentration compared
to the corn-soy basal diet regardless of variety and physical form.

There were no significant differences observed in daily GE intake, GE excreted,
ATTD of GE and AME of diets containing either white or red sorghum.
Broilers fed the diet with ground sorghum had greater (P < 0.001) daily GE
intake and excretion compared with those fed the diet with whole sorghum.
The ATTD of GE and AME were not significantly affected by physical form of
sorghum added to the diet.

Diets with grain sorghum had greater (P < 0.001) AME concentration compared
to the corn-soy basal diet regardless of variety and physical form.

On both as fed and DM basis, there were no significant differences in the AME
and AMEn of sorghum regardless of variety and physical form of grain

sorghum in the diet.


32. On DM basis, the AME and AMEn of red and white sorghum was 3,683 and
3,575 kcal/kg DM and 3,521 and 3,414 kcal/kg DM, respectively.
33. On DM basis, the AME and AMEn of ground and whole sorghum was 3,535

and 3,723 kcal/kg DM and 3,373 and 3,561 kcal/kg DM, respectively.

Based on the results of the current study, variety of sorghum does not affect growth
performance of broilers. However, feeding whole sorghum grain stimulate gizzard

development but had no effect on nutrient and energy utilization in broilers.


RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of this study, the author recommends to:
1. Evaluate the effect of variety and form of sorghum grain under commercial conditions

to validate the growth performance of broiler and AMEn measured in sorghum grain.

2. Further studies about the hardness characteristics of sorghum grain to validate its effect

on feed efficiency, CP digestibility and relative organ weights in broilers.
