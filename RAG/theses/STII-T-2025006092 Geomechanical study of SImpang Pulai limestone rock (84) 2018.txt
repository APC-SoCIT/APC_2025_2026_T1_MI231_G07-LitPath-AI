ABSTRACT

Fine-grained carbonate reservoirs represent one of the great future hydrocarbon
resources which the industry will focus on. These carbonate reservoirs exhibit extreme
heterogeneity especially complex pore size distributions thus posing complex challenges in
reservoir production and management. Geomechanics study aims to understand and predict
these challenges in the reservoir specifically the geomechanical behavior of reservoirs. Studies
have been done to develop correlations to further understand the relationship of these
geomechanical properties but due to the extreme heterogeneity of carbonate rocks, researchers
find it difficult to have an agreement on their findings. To further understand the relationships
of carbonate’s geomechanical properties, static and dynamic geomechanical properties were
investigated and correlations were developed. Twelve carbonate rock samples from Simpang
Pulai, Perak were taken for coring. The lithology and grain type were obtained using thin
section analysis. Results of thin section analysis also showed that the carbonate samples have
compacted grain arrangement resulting to lower porosity. Six cores were subjected to OYO
analysis and triaxial test. The tests determined the dynamic Young’s modulus and static
Young’s modulus respectively. The other six cores were used to test for the unconfined
compressive strength. The test determined the unconfined compressive strength of the other
six core samples. All correlations done between unconfined compressive strength and
compressional wave velocity, shear wave velocity and dynamic Young’s modulus showed
positive linear relationships. Correlations between static Young’s modulus and compressional
wave velocity, shear wave velocity and dynamic Young’s modulus have also positive
relationships. However, all coefficient of determination (R²) of the newly developed
correlations have lower values with 0.559 being the highest. The error in the experiment due
to equipment problem affected the correlation results. Therefore, due to the error in the
experiment, all the newly developed correlations will have a large error in predicting UCS and
Eₛ.

CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

The branch of petroleum engineering that is called petroleum geomechanics aims to
understand and predict the mechanical behavior of reservoirs and adjacent formations through
the full process of exploration to exploitation to abandonment [1,2]. It is a multidisciplinary
branch of petroleum engineering that understand, model, and control the mechanical response
of subsurface geo-materials, such as reservoir rocks and cap rocks. Major geomechanical
properties are usually obtained from standardized laboratory tests [3]. The geomechanics study
have many applications in the petroleum industry. In drilling engineering, it is important to
know the borehole stability and the mud weight window. The pressure induce by drilling fluid
changes the stress state of the rock. As a result, the rock around the borehole may fail if the
redistributed stresses are greater than the rock strength. In reservoir engineering, it can give
prediction about the fluid flow and can also identify the reservoir compaction. While in the

completion engineering, the geomechanics is required prior to the well stimulation job.

Fine-grained carbonate reservoirs (e.g. limestone) represent one of the great future
hydrocarbon resources which the industry will focus on. These carbonate reservoirs exhibit
extreme heterogeneity especially complex pore size distributions thus posing complex
challenges in reservoir production and management [4,5,6]. Many carbonate reservoirs will not
produce oil unless they will be fractured. This is where geomechanics play an important role
since the geomechanics can help in optimizing the well stimulation job (e.g. hydraulic

fracturing) which will maximize the production.

This study focuses in determining the geomechanical properties of limestone rocks
from Simpang Pulai, Perak. Cores will be used in this study to measure both static and dynamic

geomechanical properties of limestone samples from Simpang Pulai.

1.2 Problem Statement

Understanding geomechanical properties of rocks have come to play an increasingly
important role in the oil and gas industry. Thus, assessment of geomechanical properties of

using cylinder samples also becomes an important area of study.

Studies have been done to develop correlations and understand the relationships
between the carbonate’s geomechanical properties using compressional and shear velocities
[7,8,9,10]. However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of carbonate rocks, researchers find it
difficult to have an agreement on their finding since each of these correlations are locally
dependent on mineralogy and texture and are limited to specific rock type under certain

conditions.

To further understand the relationships of carbonate’s geomechanical properties,
investigation of static and dynamic geomechanical properties of carbonate rocks are proposed

and static and dynamic geomechanical properties will also be correlated.

1.3 Objectives

1. To determine the static and dynamic geomechanical properties of limestone.

2. To develop a new correlation that can predict the static geomechanical properties using

dynamic geomechanical property of limestone.

1.4 Scope of the Study

This study will focus on performing experiments to investigate and determine the
geomechanical properties of limestones cores from Simpang Pulai, Perak. Unconfined
Compressive Strength (UCS) & Young’s modulus in drained condition will be tested using
static tests. Using values of bulk density, shear wave velocity and compression wave velocity,

the dynamic Young’s modulus in drained condition will also be measured. The resulting

geomechanical properties from the experiment, both static and dynamic will be correlated to
produce a new correlation that can predict UCS and static Young’s modulus using shear wave

velocity, compressional wave velocity and dynamic Young’s modulus.

LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1 Carbonates

Carbonates are anionic complexes of (CO3)* and divalent metallic cations such as Ca,
Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Ba, Sr, and Cu, along with a few less common others. The bond between the
metallic cation and the carbonate group is not as strong as the internal bonds in the CO3

structure, which in turn are not as strong as the covalent bond in carbon dioxide (COz) [11].

2.1.1 Types of Minerals

The most common carbonate minerals are in the hexagonal system based on the

illustrations of Hurlbut and Klein (1977), notably calcite and dolomite as shown below.

Figure 2.1: Internal Atomic Structure of Calcite

(a) (b) (©)
Calcite Crystal Forms

Dolomite Crystal Forms

Figure 2.2: Typical Calcite and Dolomite Crystal Forms

According to Reeder R. J., (1983) in his book Carbonates: Mineralogy and Chemistry,
it is safe to say that carbonate reservoirs and aquifers are composed of calcite and dolomite -
limestones and dolostones. Together, these rocks make up about 90% ofall naturally occurring
carbonates. Only a small fraction of the remaining 10% of carbonate minerals includes azurite
and malachite, which are semiprecious stones and are commonly found in jewelry or other

ornaments [12].

2.2 Carbonate Reservoir

As stated by Dusseault, M.B., (2011) the two-major reservoir lithotypes are carbonates
and sandstones, and the two materials presenting the largest challenges are Unconsolidated
Sandstones (UCSS) and Naturally Fractured Carbonate Reservoirs (NFCR) [13].

Carbonates hold about half of the world’s oil and gas, yet of the relatively few texts on
reservoir geology, only a handful deal with carbonates. Carbonate reservoirs occur in the
subsurface so most of the data used to study them comes from borehole cores, drill cuttings,

logs, well tests, production data, and geophysical measurements [11]. To learn more about the

carbonate reservoirs and how to find, extract and manage the oil and gas it contains, further

studies are needed [14].

As mentioned, one of the problem encountered in carbonate reservoir is fracturing.
Either artificially fractured for increase production or naturally fractured reservoir (NFR), the
approach will be different compared to depositional and diagenetic reservoirs. Fractures are
generally unrelated to depositional and/or diagenetic rock properties. These types of fractures
are produced by mechanical stresses after the rocks have been lithified not like depositional
and diagenetic. There are two variables that can determine the type of fractures that will form
onarock, these are stress characteristics and material behavior. Stress is defined as force acting

on an area while strain is deformation due to stress.

£q = axial strain (unit — less)

Material behavior maybe brittle failure or ductile deformation. Figure 2.3 illustrates the

material behavior under stress.

This is where geomechanics will become an important part of this study. According to
Hamid, O., Omair, A., & Guizada, P., (2017) the changes in stress/strain affect the formation
of interest as well as the overburden layers and directly affect all operations such as drilling,
completion and production strategies because of permeability reduction. Stress affects nearly
all petrophysical properties. Compaction, shear casing and well damage, caprock integrity,

fault reactivation and sand production can occur during formation depletion [15].

2.3 Thin Section Analysis

Budennyy, S. et al., (2017) stated that microscopic thin section images play a role of
crucial source of rock properties: quantitative mineralogical and chemical compositions of
rocks, correlation of rock-forming, accessory and secondary minerals, grain size distribution,

porosity structure and saturation type [16].

Ruzyla, K., & Jezek, D. I., (1987) proposed a procedure in doing thin section.
According to them once samples have been selected, impregnation and thin sectioning

procedures are critical to successful petrographic analysis [17].

Folk (1959) and Dunham (1962) are the two most commonly used carbonate

classifications on the basis of matrix content. Figure 2.4 summarized these two carbonate

classifications [18,19].

Dunhams (1962) classifications base on matrix content and the description for each

type are shown below [19].

1. Mudstone: the rock is mostly made of carbonate mud or cryptocrystalline carbonate

matrix. Grains (fossils, ooids, etc.) will be less than 10 % of the rock.

2. Wackestone: grains make up more than 10% of the rock but the grains are "matrix

supported" they float in the matrix.

3. Packstone: grains with matrix between them but the grains are grain supported.

4. Grainstone: grains with spar (cement) between them, little or no mud.

5. Boundstone: Original components organically bound during deposition such as

stromatolites.

2.4 Geomechanical Study

Zoback, M.D., (2010) and Aadnoy, B., & Looyeh, R., (2011) defined petroleum
geomechanics as the branch of petroleum engineering that aims to understand and predict the
mechanical behavior of reservoirs and adjacent formations through the full process of

exploration to exploitation to abandonment [1,2].

As discussed by Hamid, O., Omair, A., & Guizada, P., (2017) development of
formations with stress sensitivity is raising awareness thus making geomechanics as a vital
aspect of future management. Understanding geomechanical behavior is becoming more and
more important for the petroleum industry [15]. It has been reported by many authors (e. g.
Herwanger and Koutsableloulis 2011) that significant changes in pore pressure (AP) due to
depletion or injection in weak formation might lead to increase in effective stress, compaction,
reduction in porosity and permeability, casing deformation, failure and subsidence, challenges
in fracturing the formation, closing and opening pre-existing fracture fault re-activation and
bedding parallel slippage. The deformations affect the apparent time-shifts from seismic

surveys of under and overburden.

2.5 Geomechanical Properties

According to Woehrl, B. et al., (2010) accurate knowledge of rock mechanical
properties is essential for many geomechanical applications. Examples include the prediction
of wellbore stability or the investigation of the reservoir and overburden compaction behavior

during reservoir depletion [20].

Hamid, O., Omair, A., & Guizada, P., (2017) discussed that generally, basic
geomechanical characteristics of rock material are obtained from experimental tests on core
samples at ambient conditions. To define these characteristics under in-situ conditions at depth
(temperature, confining stress, pore pressure, saturation etc.), may require extensive laboratory

experiments at more challenging and expensive conditions [15].

Yale, D. P., & Jamieson, W. H., (1994) also stated that mechanical properties can be
measured in the laboratory from triaxial tests ("'static" tests) or they can be estimated from
wireline measurements of compressional and shear acoustic velocities and rock density

("dynamic" tests) [21].

Soroush H., & Qutob H., (2011) also pointed out that formation elastic parameters
including Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and shear modulus are the input parameters for
wellbore instability and sanding prediction analysis. These parameters are customarily
estimated from laboratory experiments on core samples and called static elastic properties. This
is an expensive and time-consuming approach, as intensive care required for sample
preparation and handling. An alternative laboratory approach is to measure the dynamic moduli
on a core sample through Acoustic Travel Time (ATT) method. This method is advantageous

in being non-destructive and fast [22].

2.5.1 Static Test

2.5.1.1 Unconfined Compressive Strength Test

Uncofined compressive strength (UCS) of rocks are widely used by rock engineers in
designing surface and underground structures. The procedure for measuring this rock strength
has been standardized by both the International Society for Rock Mechanics and American
Society for Testing and Materials [23,24].

The UCS is one of the most commonly used rock engineering parameters whether for
rock mass classification or for strength determination. The mean UCS and its variability are
often assumed to represent a reliable rock material property [25]. The UCS of rock samples is

determined using either the laboratory UCS test or UCS correlated index tests [26].

In UCS test, a cylindrical rock sample is compressed along its axis until peak strength
is achieved and failure occurs. This test is intended to measure the uniaxial compressive
strength (UCS) of rock sample and elastic properties such as Young’s modulus and Poisson's
ratio are obtained by measuring and recording axial load, axial deformation and lateral

deformation [27].

2.5.1.2 Triaxial Test

Woehrl, B. et al., (2010) stated that one precise way to obtain rock mechanical
properties is to perform triaxial laboratory tests on specimens obtained from core samples.
However, extensive coring is expensive and time-consuming and is therefore not carried out
routinely. In addition, measurements made on core material can be biased due to relaxation and

alteration of cores after recovery [20].

In triaxial compression test, the sample is initially mounted within a copper jacket to
prevent the direct communication of the dry rock sample and the confining fluid. Then, sample
is compressed hydrostatically, by applying a cell pressure to a sample surrounding sleeve and
by applying an equal axial stress along its axis simultaneously. Once the requested hydrostatic
conditions achieved, axial load is to be increased and real-time data monitored. Accordingly,
axial deformation and lateral deformation will occur, one can obtain triaxial compressive
strength (TCS), Young’s modulus and Poisson's ratio, and these become dependent on
confining stress [27]. Yale, D. P., & Jamieson, W. H., (1994) proposed an experimental method

in doing triaxial test [20].

The static Young’s modulus (Es) is the ratio of axial stress (6a) and axial strain (€) and

given by Equation 2.3 below.

z= (2.3)

where:
E, = static Young's Modulus (Pa)
0q = axial stress (Pa)

€q = axial strain (unit — less)

2.5.1.2.1 Mohr — Coulomb Failure Criterion

According to Wang, D. et al., (2015) Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is a failure
criterion that provides limit to rock stresses and are essential for accurate rock failure analysis.
They are derived from laboratory tests on rock samples and can be typically divided into those
that depend on all three principal stresses and those that neglect the effect of the intermediate
principal stress on failure. The Mohr-Coulomb criterion belongs to the latter group and is thus
applicable to conventional triaxial test data (61 > 62 = 03). It is extensively applied in
geomechanics practice. The Mohr-Coulomb strength criterion proposed that when shear failure
takes place across a plane, the normal stress on and the shear stress t across that plane are

related by a functional relation characteristic of the material [27].

tT=cto,tanp (2.4)

where:
T = shear stress
On, = normal stress

c = cohesion


y = angle of internal friction of the material

2.6 Dynamic Test

2.6.1 Elastic Waves Velocity

Archer, S., and Rasouli, V., (2012) stated that dynamic geomechanical rock properties
including the Young’s modulus (E) and Poisson’s ratio (v) are calculated in relation with the
rock density (p), compression wave velocity (vp) and shear wave velocity (vs) [28]. Yale, D.
P., & Jamieson, W. H., (1994) proposed an experimental method to determine the dynamic
drained mechanical properties [21]. The dynamic Young’s modulus can be computed using

Equation 2.5.

__ pve (3v2-4v3)
Fa =" (een) e)

where:

Eayn = dynamic Young's Modulus (Pa)
p =rock density (g/cc)

U_ = compression wave velocity (m/s)

v, = shear wave velocity (m/s)

2.7 Correlation

According to Woehrl, B. et al., (2010) continuous information of mechanical properties
is frequently provided by correlation-based methods. For a given well, log-derived
petrophysical data such as: acoustic slowness, porosity, and bulk density are correlated with

laboratory-derived rock mechanical properties [20].


Soroush H., & Qutob H., (2011) added that laboratory approach to measure the
“dynamic” moduli on a core sample through Acoustic Travel Time (ATT) method cab be done
however, the “static moduli” are required to be obtained for any geomechanics related studies.
As a result, a correlation between static to dynamic moduli needs to be developed. Several
correlations have been proposed in the literature for this purpose, although each has been

developed in a specific formation and hence not appropriate to be used in other areas [22].


CHAPTER 3

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

This chapter includes a brief discussion of research methods design that were used in
this experimental study and discussed the workflow of the project. The research started by
collecting the limestone samples from Simpang Pulai, Perak. The place of the experiment is in
Universiti Teknologi Petronas, Seri Iskandar, Perak. Twelve (12) cores from the rock samples
were used to test for geomechanical properties. The size of six (6) cores was 1.5-inch by 3-inch
and this was for triaxial test and OYO analysis. The other six (6) cores were 2-inch by 4-inch.
and this was for uniaxial compressive test. Since all samples were from the same location, just
one sample underwent thin section analysis. In addition to that, Chapter 3 also presents the
equipment that were used throughout the experiment. Figure 3.1 shows the location where the
rock samples are collected and Figure 3.2 shows the flow diagram of the project. The map was

taken from google earth.

3.1 Coring

Twelve (12) cores were produced from the carbonate rock samples using a coring
machine. For triaxial test, the required core size was 3.81 by 7.62 cm. Six (6) cores with the
said size were produced. The other six (6) cores were 5.08 by 10.16 cm and this was for
unconfined compressive strength test. To achieve the desired length of the samples, trimming

was done to all samples. After trimming, samples underwent drying for one day.

3.2 Thin Section

Ruzyla, K., & Jezek, D. I., (1987) proposed procedure was adapted in doing thin section
[17]. Since all samples are from the same location, just one sample underwent thin section

analysis.

1. Samples were impregnated with low-viscosity epoxy introduced while the samples

are under a vacuum.

2. Thin section was carefully ground to final thickness (usually 30 pm) to avoid
fracturing and plucking.

3. Do the analysis on the thin section using plane polarized and cross polarized with

different magnification.

3.3 OYO Analysis

For OYO analysis, the proposed experimental method done by Yale, D. P., & Jamieson,
W. H., (1994) was the basis of the experiment [21]. SonicViewer-SX is the instrument that was
used for elastic wave velocity test. Before performing the acoustic test to all samples, a density

measurement was done to all samples by getting their mass and volumes.

1. The acoustic velocities (compressional and shear) of the six samples was

determined without pore fluid (“drained conditions”).

2. Frequencies of the acoustic measurements was approximately 500 kHz for the P-

wave and 100 kHz for the S-wave.

Using the values of compressional wave velocity, shear wave velocity and the measured
density from the analysis, dynamic Young’s modulus of each sample were computed. The
study used the elasticity equation (Equation 2.5) to compute for dynamic Young’s modulus.

This was the same equation used by Archer, S. and Rasouli, V., (2012) during their study [28].

3.4 Triaxial Test

After the ultrasonic measurement, triaxial test was carried out on the same six samples.
Yale, D. P., & Jamieson, W. H., (1994) proposed experimental method was the basis of triaxial
test and guided by the ASTM D 2664 — 95a [21,39]. IPC RT-1000 was the equipment used in

triaxial tests. Two sets were tested for triaxial test where every set contains three core samples.
1. Measurements were made in a triaxial (true biaxial) cell by recording axial and
volumetric strain as the sample was loaded axially under constant confining stress

without pore fluid.

2. Aconfining stress of 500, 1000, and 1500 psi was used for all samples to simulate

approximate reservoir stress conditions.
3. Axial loading rate was 0.8 mm/min.
Equation 2.3 was used to determine the static Young’s modulus of all six core samples.

The Mohr-Coulomb strength criterion was also used for accurate rock failure analysis.

Equation 2.4 was used to establish the equation for this failure envelope.


3.5 Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) Test

For UCS test, the “Standard Test Method for Unconfined Compressive Strength of
Intact Rock Core Specimens Designation: D 2938 — 95” was followed in this test since the
procedure for measuring this rock strength has been standardized by both the International
Society for Rock Mechanics and American Society for Testing and Materials [23,24]. IPC RT-
1000 was the equipment used for unconfined compressive strength test. Six core samples were

subjected to this test. Equation 2.1 was used to determine the UCS of six samples.

3.6 Correlation

Correlation analysis was used as this is a common statistical analysis choice in various
fields. This was used to determine to what extent geomechanical properties are correlated with
each other. For the correlation tool, Microsoft excel was used for this study as it is the handiest
and easy to use tool available. Pearson correlation coefficient (R) and R-squared (R?) were
determined between unconfined compressive strength (UCS) to compressional wave velocity
(vp), shear wave velocity (vs) and dynamic Young’s modulus (Ea). These were also done
between the static Young’s modulus (Es) and compressional wave velocity (vp), shear wave

velocity (vs) and dynamic Young’s modulus (Ea).

CHAPTER 4

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

4.1 Limestone Properties

4.1.1 Thin Section Analysis

Carbonate rocks can be generally subdivided into two major groups, limestone
composed of calcite mineral (CaCO3) and dolomite composed of dolomite mineral
(CaMg(CO3)2). The thin section analysis done in the sample confirms that it contains calcite
grains having angular to sub-angular grain shapes. This can be seen in Figure 4.1 (b) as the
encircled green mineral grains represents calcite. The grain-supported fabric makes it a
Grainstone type of carbonate rock based on Dunham’s (1962) Classification. Porosity is very

low because of the compacted grain arrangement.

Figure 4.1: Limestone Properties (a) plane polarized, 4x (b) cross polarized, 4x

Having a reduced space between grains means that the sample was subjected to high
pressure during the time of deposition that caused compaction and results to lower porosity.
This can be also supported by looking at the density of the samples. The twelve samples have

an average density of 2.84 g/cm’. This high density suggests that the sample formed from a


larger carbonate buildup that results into a high confining pressure environment and just

uplifted into the surface at present time.

4.2 OYO Analysis, UCS and Triaxial Tests

4.2.1 OYO Analysis

The static and dynamic moduli of the same rock may significantly differ from each
other. The main reason is the difference in the deformation (strain) amplitude between the
dynamic and static experiments. In the dynamic wave propagation experiment the strain is
about 10° while static strain may reach 107 [30,31]. The presence of fractures, cracks, cavities

and planes of weakness and foliation also affects the results of static and dynamic moduli [30].

Dynamic Young’s modulus depends on the compressional wave velocity, shear wave
velocity and density as it is calculated using these data. Higher values of compressional
velocity, shear velocity and density will result into higher dynamic Young’s modulus. The test
results in Table 4.1 have shown that compressional wave travel time increases (decreases) as
the density increases (decreases) and shear wave travel time also increases (decreases) as the

density increases (decreases). See Apendix A for complete results of the analysis done in the


cores. The samples density ranges from 2.83 to 2.9 g/em’ higher than the normal density range
of limestone which is 2.3 to 2.7 g/cm?, These suggests that the samples are not pure limestone

rock.

Elastic wave velocity is affected by rock density in such way that the dense rock has
higher velocity either compressional wave velocity or shear wave velocity because of the

higher compaction of the grains [32].

Compressional velocities range from 4,639 to 5,597 m/s while shear velocities range
from 2,517 to 3,040 m/s. A slight variation of compressional and shear travel time is due to
different factors like degree of weathering and decay, number of openings and orientation of

cracks [33].

4.2.2 Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) Test

Unconfined compression test was done to identify and measure the shear strength of
the core samples. There were six runs done in this study to test and analyze all the cores. There
were also two stresses recorded; maximum stress and breakpoint stress. The maximum stress
is defined as the unconfined compressive strength which is one of the mechanical properties

that this study needs to determine.

Figure 4.2 shows the graph of load-strain for SPS-7 core. The graph shows the
maximum load and the break point load. The maximum load of 133.56 kN resulted to a
maximum stress of 65.39 kPa. This maximum stress is defined as the unconfined compressive
strength of the sample and can be seen as the highest peak in Figure 4.2 above. This is the point
where the sample starts to crack internally. While the break point load of 128.3 KN resulted to
a break point stress of 62.81 kPa. This happens when the core starts to break and slides along
the line. This can be seen in the graph above as the sudden drop of the line after the maximum
load. It can also be noticed that before reaching the maximum load, the graph trend shows a

sudden decrease before increasing again. This sudden decrease is caused by an existing internal

crack in the core sample.

Figure 4.3: Load-Strain Graph of SPS-8

Load-strain graph for SPS-8 shows an internal crack in the core sample. The reason
behind this can be seen in Figure 4.3. The graph trend shows slight decrease of load before
reaching the maximum load which confirms the existence of internal crack. The maximum load
which can be seen in figure 4.3 as the peak of the graph has a maximum stress of 42.59 kPa.
This maximum stress is the unconfined compressive strength. This maximum stress indicates
that the core starts to crack internally. Before reaching the break point load of 67.7 KN, the
graph shows a sudden increase in the trend line. This shows that the core is not totally reaching
its brittle fracture. After that sudden increase, the break point load was reached and the core

totally breaks and slides along a line.

The maximum load of SPS-9 can be seen in Figure 4.4 above. The load-strain graph
demonstrates the point where the core starts to crack internally. This point is the peak of the
graph having a maximum load of 106.6 kN which is equal to 52.20 kPa maximum stress. This
maximum stress is the unconfined compressive strength of the core. However, based on the
result, the break point load is higher than the maximum load. The break point load result of
117.6 KN has a maximum stress of 57.55 kPa. The value of break point stress is supposedly
lower than maximum stress since load will drop when it reaches the maximum stress due to
internal crack. This will continue until it reaches the break point stress where the core will

fracture completely.

Figure 4.5: Load-Strain Graph of SPS-10

SPS-10 load-strain graph in Figure 4.5 above shows the maximum load and break point
load of the core. Before reaching the maximum load, the trend of the graph shows a decrease
in the load before increasing again. This was caused by the existence of an internal crack in the
core sample. The load increase continues after the effect of the internal crack until it reaches
the maximum load of 121.7 kN. The maximum stress at this point is 59.57 kPa which is the
defined as the unconfined compressive strength. This maximum load is the peak of the graph.
At this stage, the sample starts to crack internally and it will continue to crack until it reaches
the point where the crack breaks along the line. This is called as the break point and can be

seen in the figure above as the sudden drop of the load.

Figure 4.6: Load-Strain Graph of SPS-11

An effect of internal crack can be seen in Figure 4.6 above. A sudden decrease of the
load before increasing again suggest that the sample have an existing internal crack. The graph
shows a continuous increase until it reaches the peak. The peak of the graph is the maximum
load where the core starts to experience internal crack due to the applied load on the sample.
The maximum load is 79.2 kN which resulted to maximum stress of 38.78 kPa. This maximum
stress will be the unconfined compressive strength. The graph above also suggests that the
sample experience plastic deformation before reaching the break point since Figure 4.6 shows
a gradual drop of the graph. However, like the result in SPS-9, the break point load result in
SPS-11 is also higher than the maximum load. The break point load result is 117.6 kN. This is
the same result with SPS-9 whereas supposedly the break point should be lower than maximum
stress since load will drop when it reaches the maximum stress due to the effect of internal

crack.

Figure 4.7: Load-Strain Graph of SPS-12

There’s no sign of that SPS-12 contains any internal crack as can be seen in Figure 4.7.
The load-strain graph above shows the point where the core starts to crack internally. This point
is the peak of the graph having a maximum load of 114.6 kN which gives a 56.10 kPa maximum
stress. The maximum stress is the unconfined compressive strength of the core. The break point
load in this test is higher than the maximum load. The break point load is 117.6 kN while the
maximum load is 114.6 KN. As discussed, the value of break point stress is supposedly lower
than maximum stress since load will drop when it reaches the maximum stress due to internal
crack and it will continue until it reaches the break point stress where the core will fracture

completely.

All of the samples exhibit low UCS. The cause of this is due to the effect of weathering.
The unconfined compressive strength decreases as weathering increases due to the changes in
microfabric especially in porosity and pore geometry [37]. However, SPS-9, SPS-11 and SPS-
12 tests resulted to a higher breakdown pressure values than maximum pressure. These errors
from the experiment due to equipment problem affected the results. Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9

shows the samples before and after UCS test.

4.2.3 Triaxial Test

A total of six tests were done for the triaxial tests using the remaining core samples.
The triaxial test results were used to get the Young’s Modulus and produce the Mohr Circle to

identify the failure envelope of the core samples.

Figure 4.10: Mohr Circle — Set 1

In order to determine the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for all test data, Mohr circles
of three samples were plotted in one graph as can be seen in Figure 4.10. As mentioned, each
sample undergone triaxial test with different confining pressure. All of these are graphically

shown as circles in Figure 4.10.

3 (SPS-4) 1,492 60,258 |

Table 4.2 describes the behavior of the three samples when subjected to different stress.
The Sigma-3 (03) in triaxial test is the minimum principal stress while Sigma-1 (01) is the
maximum principal stress. In this experiment, 0; is represented by axial stress (vertical stress)
while 63 is represented by radial stress (horizontal stress). This means that in SPS-2, the
minimum principal stress it can take is 739.5 kPa while the maximum principal stress it can
take is 88,767 kPa. This is also the same with SPS-3 having a minimum principal stress of
1,005 kPa and maximum principal stress of 1,094,494 kPa. While SPS-4 have 1,492 kPa and
60,258 kPa minimum and maximum principal stresses respectively. These are limit of the

principal stresses of the three samples or the failure envelope.

The Mohr-Coulomb Criterion for set 1 is given by the equation below. The cohesion
value of 5,994.1 kPa is the limit of shear stress that the rock can accommodate without going
to failure. This is a linear equation that will determine if the rock will fail or not. This means

that any value outside the failure envelope will fail.
T = 5,994.1 + o,tan69.9 (4.1)
The static Young’s Modulus of the three samples were also determined to be 9.3 GPa,

14.6 GPa and 17.2 GPa respectively. Young’s Modulus describe the stiffness of the material,
meaning the higher the Young’s Modulus the stiffer the material. The higher modulus of the


samples was caused by the higher axial stress due to the effect of confining pressure. Confining

pressure causes the samples to become “stiffer” thus resulting into a higher axial stress.

Figure 4.11: Mohr Circle — Set 2

Mohr circles of three more samples for set 2 were also plotted in one graph to determine
the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for all test data. The samples undergone triaxial test with
different confining pressure and the results of principal stresses were graphically shown as

circles in Figure 4.11.

| 3 (SPS-1) 1,491 | 89,384

The results of the triaxial test can also be seen in Table 4.3 above. Like the first result
on set 1, Sigma-3 (03) is the minimum principal stress while Sigma-1 (01) is the maximum
principal stress. The minimum principal stress SPS-6 can accommodate is 704 kPa while the
maximum principal stress it can accommodate is 50,706 kPa. SPS-5 has a minimum principal
stress of 1,013 kPa and maximum principal stress of 68,049 kPa. The last sample, SPS-1 has
1,491 kPa minimum principal stress and 89,384 kPa maximum principal stress. These principal

stresses are the limit and represents the failure envelope of set 2.

The Mohr-Coulomb Criterion for set 2 is given by Equation 4.2. This equation
determines if the material such as rock will fail or not. Any value outside the failure envelope
means the material will fail. The cohesion of the rock describes the amount of shear stress the
rock can accommodate without breaking. For set 2 results, the limit or the cohesion is 3,200.1
kPa.

T = 3,200.1 + o,tan70 (4.2)
The static Young’s Modulus is the ratio of axial stress and axial strain which describes
the materials stiffness. The higher the Young’s Modulus the stiffer the material will be. The

static Young’s modulus of the three samples are 10.1 GPa, 15.1 GPa and 11.9 GPa respectively.

The higher modulus of the samples was caused by the higher axial stress due to the effect of


confining pressure. When confining pressure increases, the core sample will become “longer”,

the axial stress will increase, and thus static Young’s modulus will increase.

The figures below show the limestone samples before and after the triaxial test. There
were two sets of triaxial test done. Set-1 used SPS-2, SPS-3 and SPS-4 cores while set-2 used
SPS-1, SPS-5 and SPS-6 cores for triaxial testing.

4.3 Correlation

4.3.1 UCS to vp and vs Correlation

The correlation lines of UCS to vp and vs for the combined data from the experiment
are given by relations that are shown in Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16 respectively. The equations
for these relationships are given below:

UCS = 0.0202v, — 49.545 (4.3)

UCS = 0.0257, — 20.139 (4.4)

Figure 4.16: Linear Correlation between UCS and vs

Parameters like porosity and density have some influences on rock strength [22]. These
the same parameters have also an effect on the compressional wave velocity and shear wave
velocity [32,33]. Therefore, UCS is expected to show a relationship with these elastic waves
velocity. A positive relationship can be seen in both plots above with correlation coefficient
(R) of 0.67 for UCS to vp and 0.78 for UCS to vs. This means that the linear relationship strength
of UCS to vs is 67% while UCS to v; is 78%. Positive relationship means that UCS increase

linearly with increasing compressional wave velocity and shear wave velocity. The positive


relationship of UCS to elastic waves velocity is due to the fact that the effect of porosity and

density are the same in UCS and elastic waves velocity (22,34,35].

4.3.2 UCS to Ey Correlation

Relationship of UCS and dynamic Young’s modulus (Ez) can be seen in Figure 4.17.

This relationship is represented by Equation 4.5.

Figure 4.17: Linear Correlation between UCS and Ea

Compressional wave velocity, shear wave velocity and density will be used to get the
dynamic Young’s modulus (Eq) [28]. The compressional velocity and shear wave velocity will
be dependent on porosity, fluid saturation and density [32,33]. Thus, these parameters will also
have an effect on the dynamic Young’s modulus value. Porosity and density have also an effect
on rock strength [22]. This suggests that there is a relationship between unconfined
compressive strength (UCS) and dynamic Young’s modulus (Eq). Figure 4.17 showed that

there’s a positive linear relationship between UCS and Eq meaning UCS increases linearly as


the Eu increases. The strength of this linear relationship is 75% (R=0.75). Like the UCS to vp
and v; correlation, the same explanation can be applied here to describe the positive relationship

of UCS to Ea since Ea depends on these elastic waves velocity and density.

4.3.3 Es to vp and vs Correlation

The correlation of static Young’s Modulus (Es) to vp and vs are presented in Figure 4.18

and Figure 4.19 respectively. Equation 4.6 represents the linear relationship of Es to vp while

Equation 4.7 represents the linear relationship of E; to vs.

Figure 4.19: Linear Correlation between Es and vs

Static test measures the Young’s modulus (Es) of the cores directly while compressional
wave velocity (vp), shear wave velocity (vs) and density will be used to get the dynamic
Young’s modulus (Ea) indirectly [28]. Thus, Es is expected to have a relationship with elastic
waves velocity since elastic waves are used for the computation of Ea. Based on Figure 4.18
and Figure 4.19, Es to vp correlation and E; to vs correlation exhibit positive linear relationships.
However, correlation between Es to vp resulted into a low correlation coefficient. Es correlation
coefficient (R) to vp is 0.06 (6%) while for Es to vs the correlation coefficient (R) resulted to
0.29 (29%). This means that the results of elastic wave velocity correlation to Es gives uncertain
values resulting to lower correlation coefficients especially the Es to vp. Based on the result of
triaxial test done, SPS-1, SPS-2, SPS-4 and SPS-5 cores have existing cracks that affected the
results for both E; and elastic waves velocity. The presence of cracks in the material affects the
material’s deformability under static loading, meaning that the Young’s modulus obtained from
the static test will have a lower value [30,31]. Compressional wave velocity was also affected
by the presence of cracks. Compressional wave velocity decreased by 0.6% as the crack density
changed and decreased by 1.5% as the crack aperture increased, suggesting that the presence

of natural fractures affect the vp since vp cannot propagate well through the material with gaps
[30,36].


4.3.4 Es to Ey Correlation

The regression line of static Young’s Modulus (Es) on dynamic Young’s Modulus (Ea)

of carbonate rocks for the combined data is given by Equation 4.8.

Static Young's Modulus (GPa)

Dynamic Young's Modulus (GPa)

Figure 4.20: Linear Correlation between Es and Ea

Figure 4.20 showed a positive relationship between Es to Ea. This positive relationship
means there is a linear increase between E; and Eg. The reason for this positive relationship is
because both geomechanical properties were measured to know the “stiffness” of the cores.
The only difference is that static test measures Young’s modulus directly while dynamic test
measures it indirectly. However, the correlation coefficient (R) of the two geomechanical
properties is giving a low strength of correlation. Based on the result, the correlation coefficient
(R) is 0.33 (33%). The presence of cracks in SPS-1, SPS-2, SPS-4 and SPS-5 cores were the
reason why the results of static tests were inconsistent than the results of dynamic tests which

resulted to a lower correlation coefficient. The static method, which is necessary for


quantifying the rock’s deformability, is more sensitive to the presence of discontinuities in the
rock [30]. The more discontinuities in the rock, the lower the Young’s modulus value and the

higher the discrepancy between the static and dynamic values [30,31].

Table 4.4 presented the predicted relations, coefficient of correlation and coefficient of
determination of the different parameters. UCS to vs correlation gives the highest degree of
correlation coefficient, followed by UCS to Eu correlation and UCS to vp correlation. While
the correlations of Es; to vp, vs and Eq resulted to a lower correlation coefficient. However,
coefficient of determination (R?) showed that the equations developed were not good at
predicting the UCS and E; since all results give lower R?. The errors in the experiment due to

equipment problem affected the position of data points that resulted into lower R?.

CHAPTER 5

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1 Conclusion

Based on the results of the experiment done to 12 core samples, the following

conclusions may be drawn from the study:

The UCS of the samples were determined using Unconfined Compressive Strength test.
UCS of the six limestone cores were found to be 65.39 kPa, 42.59 kPa, 52.20 kPa, 59.57
kPa, 38.78 kPa and 56.10 respectively. Using triaxial test, the static Young’s modulus
were also determined. The static Young’s modulus of the six samples were found to be
11.9 GPa, 9.3 GPa, 14.6 GPa, 17.2 GPa, 15.1 GPa and 10.1 GPa respectively. OYO
analysis were used to determine the dynamic Young’s modulus of the core samples.
Using the compressional wave velocities and shear wave velocities from OYO Analysis
and the measured densities of the samples, the dynamic Young’s modulus of six
samples were found to be 65.9 GPa, 55.3 GPa, 59.8 GPa, 65.3 GPa, 48.7 GPa and 50.3
GPa respectively.

Due to the equipment error, the newly developed correlations for predicting UCS and
E; were affected. R? highest value of 0.559 in UCS versus Eu was not in the acceptable
value of 0.9. Other R? results in the developed correlations are lower than 0.559.
Although all correlations showed positive relationships, these results are still not
enough to state that the established relationships have strong correlations. Therefore,
due to the error in the experiment, all the newly developed correlations will have a large

error in predicting UCS and Es.


5.2 Recommendations

The data presented in this work is just a small step to further understand the behavior
of limestone rocks. Several future work recommendations that might lead to improved

understanding on the geomechanical properties of limestone are listed below.

¢ Develop a correlation of static to dynamic geomechanical properties of limestone not

using the compressional and shear wave velocity.

e Evaluation of the relationship of limestone geomechanical properties to other properties

(e.g. porosity, permeability, pressure, temperature, type of mineral, saturation).

e Investigation of the differences of the static and dynamic geomechanical properties

from the laboratory and the log-based estimate geomechanical properties.
