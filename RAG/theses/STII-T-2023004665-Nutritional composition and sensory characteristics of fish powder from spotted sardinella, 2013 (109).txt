ABSTRACT

VILLANUEVA, KATHERINE DE CASTRO University of the Philippines Los Bafios.
April 2013.Nutritional Composition and Sensory Characteristics of Fish Powder
from Spotted Sardinella, Amblygaster sirm (Walbaum, 1792) (Teleolstei: Clupeidae).

Major Professor: Dr. Wilma A. Hurtada

Fish powder was produced from Amblygaster sirm which had the highest
docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acid content (698.77 mg/100 g of raw, edible
portion) compared to other sardine species namely Sardinella gibbosa, Sardinella
lemuru, and Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus. The proximate composition and mineral
content of raw and powdered Amblygaster sirm were analyzed. Also. the microbial

content, lipid oxidation and sensory characteristics of the fish powder were determined.

The raw Amblygaster sirm contains 75.76 % moisture. 88.99 % crude protein.
5.03 % crude fat, and 5.53 % crude ash. The moisture, crude protein and crude fat
decreased significantly (p<0.05) to 4.76 %. 61.59 % and 4.65 %. respectively while ash
increased significantly (p<0.05) to 15.86 % after drying. Unlike zinc and calcium, iron
content of the sardine increased significantly (1.96 to 41.84 mg/100 g). Docosahexaenoic
acid was the only polyunsaturated fatty acid that was detected in the fish powder after
drying (687.59 mg/100 g). The microbial analysis showed that the aerobic plate. mold
and yeast counts. Salmonella and Vibrio parahaemolyticus detected in the powdered

sardine were within the acceptable limit thus considered safe for human consumption.

Furthermore, the product had low lipid oxidation since the peroxide value and free fatty
acid was 8.58 meq/kg and 0.19 % (as oleic acid), respectively. Sensory evaluation
showed that increasing the amount of the fish powder added to the rice gruel affected its
sensory attributes (p<0.05). The concentration of 4.5 % fish powder added in 157 g of

rice gruel was most acceptable and evaluated as moderately liked.

INTRODUCTION

The Philippines is an archipelago with over 2.2 million km? of large bodies of
water that provides an enormous resource for fishing and this industry is also one of the
major economic sectors in the country (Green at al. 2003). In 2008, Philippines ranked 6"
in producing fish worldwide (FAO 2012). It has a total production of 49.7 million metric
tons of fish, crustaceans, mollusks. and aquatic plants (Green et al. 2003). In terms of fish
diversity, there are almost 2.500 species in the country that includes small pelagic fishes
such as roundscads (Decapterus spp. Carangidae). anchovies (Stolephorus spp..
Engraulidae), sardines (Sardinella spp.. Clupeidae) and mackerels (Rasirelliger spp..
Scombridae) (FAO 2012) which dominate the catch per volume of landings (Willette et
al. 2011). The FAO data stated that as of 2003 small pelagic fishes are about 60% of the
total capture of fishery production of the country and Dalzell et al. (1987) estimated that
it has a Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) of 550, 000 metric tons (Willette et al.

2011).

Sardines are one of the main captured fish in the country and the most common
species are Sardinella fimbriata and Sardinella lemuru (Willette et al. 2011). Sardines
have several local names such as manamsi, tunsoy. tamban, turay, etc. (Willette et al
2011). Generally. fish supplies approximately 6 % of the world’s protein and 16 % of
animal protein, In the country. it serves as the main source of animal protein (Demaine
and Halwart 2001). The Philippines’ mean one-day per capita consumption of fish and

fish products was 110.0 g (FNRI-DOST 2008). It contributes 12.8 % of the total food

intake of a household Filipino member for one day. According to Espejo-Hermes (2004).
fish accounted for 56 % of the total intake of animal protein in the diet. Aside from
protein, fish is a good source of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
particularly the fatty fish including sardines. These PUFAs are well studied and provided
convincing roles in decreasing the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and in
improving fetal brain and vision development (FAO/WHO 2008). Moreover, minerals
specifically iron, calcium and zinc are found in fish. Iron facilitates the transport of
oxygen to different tissues while zinc functions as an integral constituent of a number of
metallo-enzymes wherein it regulates carbohydrate. lipid. and protein metabolism
(Gropper et al. 2009). Calcium, on the other hand, mainly functions in the mineralization
of bones and teeth (Whitney et al. 2001). This mineral has also a role in muscle
contraction and relaxation, nerve functioning, blood clotting and blood pressure. Sardine
is considered as one of the most affordable fish available in the market thus plays a big
role in ensuring country’s food and nutrition security (Menasveta 2001).

Further processing of fresh fish is needed in order to lengthen its storage life
particularly when the catch is abundant. Different methods of processing can be done
which includes drying. curing. salting. freezing. canning, etc. The most conventional and
affordable method of preservation of fish is drying. Nowadays. different methods of
drying are implemented such as artificial drying. Several advantages are brought by the
use of artificial dryers than the traditional ones including reduction of insect infestations
or other forms of contamination. increases storage life due to lower moisture content, not

affected by weather conditions and give products that have better quality based on

texture, color and flavor (Unmole 1989). In developing countries in Asia almost 50% of
catch is dried (Unmole 1989). Processing of fish should be handled carefully because it is
highly perishable and easily deteriorates. Moreover, during processing, the degradation of

quality and losses of nutrients should be minimized.

The nutritional composition of most of the local fish in the Philippines is limited
particularly in fatty acid profile. Such data are important for nutritionist in selecting fish
for a dish that will provide high levels of omega 3 PUFAs. Also, nutritional data is
important for the food technologist on their interest of developing nutritious products
from fish. The most known fish including salmon, herring and tuna that are well studied
for nutrient contents are not always available and affordable particularly in most of the
rural communities. Thus, the role of other locally available fish which are commonly
consumed should be studied. Moreover, the inadequate fish intake particularly among
growing children also limits their intake of omega 3 PUFAs and other nutrients. Thus.
developing a complementary food from locally available omega 3 rich fish will address

the nutritional problem.

Objectives of the Study

The study generally aimed to develop an acceptable fish powder that is high in
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as omega 3 particularly docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and omega 6, and in minerals iron. calcium and

zine from Sardinella species. Specifically, the study aimed to:

1. Determine the fatty acid profile such as DHA and EPA, minerals such as iron.
calcium and zinc. and proximate composition of raw sardines and processed
sardine powder:

2. Correlate the effect of drying process on the nutrient contents (particularly
DHA, EPA, iron, calcium and zinc) of fish powder;

3. Estimate the microbial content and rancidity of the product; and

4. Evaluate the sensory characteristics of the sardine powder.

‘Time and Place of the Study

The study was conducted at the Food Science Cluster, College of Agriculture.
University of the Philippines Los Bafios, College, Laguna from June 2012 to March
2013. The analysis of fatty acid profile of the fish and lipid oxidation tests of the fish
powder were done at the Industrial Technology Development Institute (ITDI) of
Department of Science and Technology (DOST). The determination of proximate
composition and mineral content of the fish was done at the Central Analytical Services
Laboratory of National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. University of

the Philippines Los Bafios.

Scope and Limitation of the Study

The study evaluated the fatty acid content of four sardine species (Sardinella
lemuru, Sardinella gibbosa, Ambylgaster sirm and Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus) that
are commonly caught from Batangas. The focus of the fatty acid analysis was on the
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as the omega 3 PUFA [including a-linolenic
acid (18:3 n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6 n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA) (20:4 n-3)]. However. different factors such as water temperature, reproductive
age. diet, salinity etc. that may affect the fatty acid content of fish species were not
considered in the study. Fatty acid analysis was conducted by the Industrial Technology
Development Institute (ITD1) of Department of Science and Technology (DOST) because
there are no laboratories within the Luzon area that conduct this kind of analysis. The

sardine species with the highest level of DHA and EPA were subjected for further study.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE

Sardines (Clupeidae)

Taxonomy, Diagnostic Feature and Geographical Distribution

Clupeidae family consists of herrings, sardines and shads. These are small.
silvery, with special scales along the belly (also called as scutes) and schooling. Most of
these fishes feed on plankton. One of the distinct characteristics of these fishes is that
they have short dorsal fin near the middle of the body and no spines in fins. They are
located mostly in shallow-water habitats such as the freshwater, brackish estuaries, coasts
and oceanic reefs. Generally. these fishes are very important to fisheries and they are

considered as the half of the world’s main fish catch (Randall et al. 1997),

In the Philippines. there are about ten species of sardines that exists. The five
most common sardines are Sardinella fimbriata, S. gibbosa, S. lemuru, Dussumieria
acuta, Amblygastersirm while Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus, S._albella,
Herklotsichthys dispilonotus, S. tawilis, S. hualiensis, Escualosa thoracata are also found

(BFAR 2009).

Some of which that are common in Batangas province are S. gibbosa, S. lemuru,
Amblygastersirm and H. quadrimaculatus. All of these sardines are under the class

Actinopterygii (ray finned fishes), order of Clupeiformes (Herrings) and a family of

Clupeidae. They are all coastal. pelagic, and schooling with the following distinct

features of each species:

Amblygaster sirm has a slender body, rounded belly and the scutes are not
prominent. The species has a series of 10 to 20 gold (if alive) or black (under
preservation) spots down the flank and 33 to 43 lower gill rakers. It can be found in Indo-
West Pacific including coasts of Africa, Red Sea and Madagascar, eastward to the
Philippines, Taiwan Island, Okinawa, New Guinea Fiji and Northern coast of Australia.
They feed mainly on copepod, naupli and zoea larvae, larval bivalves and gastropods. It

reaches 23 cm in standard length (Whitehead 1985).

Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus has a slender body with a depth about 18 to 30
% of standard length. The flank has silvery with an electric blue line preceded by two
orange spots. It has elongate wing like scales underneath the normal paired pre-dorsal
scales. This species is widely distributed in Indian Ocean and Western Pacific. They feed
on zooplankton at night, copepods in juvenile stages and adult species feed on larger
preys (shrimps. small fishes, chaetognaths). It is found to reach 14 cm standard length but

usually 10 em (Whitehead 1985).

Sardinella gibbosa has moderately slender body with a depth of 24 to 30 % of
standard length. It has 32 to 34 scutes; 45 to 50 lower gill rakers; vertical striae on scales
are not meeting at the center with numerous small perforations on the hind part of the

scale. Moreover, it has golden midlateral line down the flank: dusky dorsal and caudal

fin; dark spot at the dorsal fin. The species is very profuse in the Indo-West Pacific. Its

size reaches up to 17 cm but usually 15 cm (Whitehead 1985).

Sardinella lemuru has rounded belly, elongated. sub-cylindrical, and body depth
of less than 30 % of standard length. It also has faint golden spot behind gill opening,
followed by a faint golden midlateral line and with distinct black spot at hind of gill
cover. This species is located at Eastern Indian Ocean and Western Pacific. They feed on
phytoplankton and zooplankton. The size can reach up to 23 cm standard length but

usually 20 cm (Whitehead 1985),

Lipids in Fish

Fish contains 63 to 84 % water, 14 to 24 % protein and 0.5 tol7 % lipid by
weight. Pelagic fish or sometimes called as fatty fish such as sardines have higher lipids
(9 to 17 g/100 g) than the demersal fish that live at the bottom of the ocean (0.3 to 1.6
2/100 g). The major forms of lipid in fish are triglycerides. These exist as either large
droplets within the adipose tissue or smaller droplets in the extra and intracellular muscle
cells and serve as the energy source for fish. Triglycerides in pelagic fish contain the
long chain fatty acid: 20:5 n-3 eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and 22:6 n-3 docosahexaenoic
acid. On the other hand, phospholipids are the building blocks of muscle cell membranes
and usually present at low levels (0.5 to 1.1 %). The long chain polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFAs) are higher in the membrane phospholipids than in storage triglycerides.

Moreover. in pelagic fish. lipids are stored in the head and muscle while in demersal fish.

lipids are stored primarily in the liver and peritoneal lining and under the skin. The lipid
content of pelagic fish is affected by the season, feeding ground, water salinity and
spawning. They do not feed during spawning but depend on lipid stores for energy. Cold
water fish contain higher levels of PUFAs compared to those adapted to warm waters
because these unsaturated fatty acids is very important to maintain membrane fluidity and

its function at low temperature (Yui et al. 2006).

Seafoods can be classified into four categories depending on their fat content: lean
fish species with 2 % and below fat content. low fat fish with 2 to 4 % fat, medium fat
fish with 4 to 8 % fat and fatty fish with more than 8 % fat. However, this classification is
not applicable to many species because their fat composition varies with season. The fat
content found in fish particularly in mackerel and sardines are reported in the descending
order: skin (including subcutaneous lipid)>viscera>dark muscle>white muscle. In most

fish there are descending fat levels from head to tail (Yui et al. 2006),

Lipids

Classes of Lipids

Triacyglycerol. These consist of three molecules of fatty acids esterified to the sn-

1, sn-2 and sn-3 positions of L-glycerol as shown in Figure 1. Some of the examples of

tiacyglycerides are trioleoylglycerol (triolein) which oleic acid is the only fatty acid

esterified; dioleoylmonopalmitoylglycerol which has two fatty acids is esterified. Most of

the saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids are esterified at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions

of glycerol while PUFA are located in the sn-2 position of glycerol (Sargent 2002)

Figure 1. Triacylglycerol:three fatty acids esterified to ,-glycerol (Sargent,
2002)

Wax esters. A lipid which consists of a single molecule of fatty acid esterified to a
single molecule of fatty alcohol. This is very common among the marine zooplankton and

also found in the body tissues and eggs of some fish species (Sargent 2002).

Figure 2, Wax ester: fatty acid chain on top which is esterified to fatty alcohol
at the bottom (Sargent 2002)

Phosphoglycerides. These are composed of one of the ~OH groups of glycerol
esterified to phosphoric acid which is also linked to another amino alcohol. It also serves

as the major components of cell membranes (Seagar and Slabaugh 2010).

Figure 3.Phosphatidic acid: backbone of phosphoglycerides

Sphingolipids. This lipid has sphingosine, an 18 carbon amino alcohol, instead of

a glycerol. Moreover. sphigolipids is fatty acid esterified to a sphingosine via an amide

linkage to form a ceramide (Seagar and Slabaugh 2010).

PSI/YIIVVWV

Figure 4.Sphingomyelin, an example of shingolipids

Sterols. Sterols are different from other lipids because it contains multi-ring
structures. It can be free (not bonded to another molecule) or attached to a fatty acid

through an ester bond (McGuirre and Berman 2011).

Fatty Acid Structure

All of the above mentioned lipid classes contain fatty acids linked to alcohol
group such as in glycerides and to amino groups like in sphingolipids except for
cholesterol. Fatty acids can be classified based on their chain lengths, their degree of
unsaturation (number of double bonds), and position of their double bonds (McGuirre

and Beerman 2011).

Saturated fatty acids. This type is very common in animals such as fish and in
lipids with chain length ranging from C14 to C24. The saturated fatty acid chain does not
contain any double bonds or other functional groups (Figure 5). Moreover, saturated
pertains to as many as possible hydrogen molecules that are bonded to all carbons (apart
from the carboxylic acid [-COOH] group) of the chain. Saturated fatty acids are straight
chains and thus can be tightly packed together, that allows organism to store energy very

densely.

Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Like saturated fatty acids
commonly these fatty acids have length of C14 to C24. From its name, monounsaturated
fatty acids have one double bond in their structure while polyunsaturated fatty acids have

two or more double bond (Figure 5).

Fish Nutrients and Human Health

Fish Protein and Minerals in Human Health

Fish serves as an important part of a diet of most Asian countries particularly

Philippines. It is a good source of high quality protein together with healthy omega-3

PUFAs and different highly bioavailable micronutrients such as iron, calcium and zine

(McManus and Newton 2011),

The quality of protein that fish offers is a complete protein because it has
complete array of essential amino acids. Fish protein is high in lysine, sulphur containing
amino acids and threonine which are the limiting amino acids in cereal based diets.
Proteins are necessary components for maintenance of bodily structures, bone health.
regulation of body composition. glucose metabolism, immunity and cell signaling

(McManus and Newton 2011).

In animal sources of food such as fish. zinc is bounded to protein which is highly
bioavailable (McManus and Newton 2011). Fish accumulate zine from both water and
dietary sources. Zine regulates many metabolic processes of carbohydrate, lipid, and
protein metabolism (Gropper et al. 2009). Food processing may affect the bioavailability
of zinc, Heat treatment can cause zine to form complexes that resist hydrolysis. thus
making zinc unavailable for absorption. For instance, Maillard reaction (amino acid-
carbohydrate complexes resulting from browning) are noted for inhibiting zinc’s

availability for absorption (Severi et al. 1997)

Dietary iron is found in two forms in foods, heme and non heme. Heme iron i
derived mainly from hemoglobin and myoglobin and thus, is found in animal product
especially meat, fish and poultry. About 50 % to 60 % of iron in meat, fish and poultry is

heme iro

; the remaining is non heme iron (Gropper et al. 2009). Iron is an essential
micronutrient because it facilitates the transport of oxygen throughout the body coupled
with its role in growth, healing and immune function (McManus and Newton 2011).

Cooking can increase the bioavailability of iron (Severi et al. 1997).

Fish, particularly small fishes are eaten with bones. These bones are good source
of calcium. Calcium is important in the structure of the skeleton and maintenance of the
extracellular fluid calcium concentration (Eastwood 2003). There should be positive
calcium balance for the bone growth to occur (Eastwood 2003). The bioavailability of the
calcium obtained from fish bones is same as the calcium found in milk. Thus. the intake
of small fishes can contribute to the calcium needs of the body particularly among the

population who are not milk drinkers (Kawarazuka and Bene 2011).

Essential Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid

Polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic and linolenic acid are called essential fatty
acids (EFAs) because it cannot be synthesized or convert one to another by the human
body and thus must be supplied from the diet (Sienkiewicz et al. 2012).

Deficiency in all PUFA may lead to different health problems such as symptoms of
reproductive failure, skin abnormalities and kidney and liver disorder appear.
Furthermore, deficiency of certain PUFAs [particularly decosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]
during infants’ growth and development may cause retarded growth and impaired vision

(Sienkiewicz et al. 2012).

EFAs are used by the body as starting material for eicosanoids. These eicosanoids
are hormone like that affect different functions in the body such as muscle relaxation, and

muscle

contraction, blood vessel dilation and blood vessel constriction, blood clot formation,
blood lipid regulation and immune response to injury and infection. Moreover. EFAs is
an important component for the structural and functional role of the cell membranes;
promotes normal brain and vision development particularly for infants, assist in gene
regulation, maintain structure of the skin, and helps in regulating genetic activities

affecting metabolism (Sienkiewicz et al. 2012).

Omega 3 and Omega 6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

Alpha linolenic acid (ALA) is an 18 carbon chain with three cis double bonds.
The first double bond is at the omega-3 end of the fatty acid. Some of the food sources of
ALA are canola, soybeans walnuts and flaxseeds. Another omega 3 is EPA
(eicosapentanoic acid), a 20 carbon chain with five cis-double bonds. The first double
bond is at the third carbon from the last carbon of the chain thus it is also considered as
omega 3 (Whitney et al. 2001). Fatty fish such as herring. mackerel, salmon and sardines
are the good sources of EPA. DHA is a 22-carbon chain with six cis-double bond. Also.
its first double bond is located at the third carbon from the omega end of the chain thus
considered as omega 3. DHA can be obtained from food such as the fatty fish (herring.

mackerel, salmon, sardines) (Temple et al. 2012),

Omega 6 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids. Some of which are LA
(Linoleic acid) and AA (arachidonic acid). LA is an 18-carbon fatty acid wherein the

first double is found at the sixth carbon from the omega end of the chain. The food

sources of this fatty acid are soybean oil. corn oil, peanut oil and cottonseed. However.
AA is a 20-carbon fatty acid that has its first double bond at the sixth carbon from the
omega end of chain. Food sources such as peanut oil, meats, eggs and dairy products are

rich in AA (Whitney et al. 2001).

Linoleic acid (LA) is the parent member of the omega-6 fatty acid family. From
LA, the body can synthesize other members of omega 6 fatty acids such as arachidonic
acids (AA). On the other hand, Linolenic acid (LNA) is the parent member of the omega
3 fatty acid family. From LNA. the body can manufacture other members of the omega 3
family such as EPA and DHA. These two omega 3 members are of great interest because
of its role in heart related diseases, The body makes only limited amounts of these fatty

acids but they are found abundant in the oils of certain fish (Sienkiewicz et al. 2012).

It has been well known that the natives of Greenland and Alaska have low rates
of death from heart diseases. The result of the study traced the abundant fish intake and
other marine life in their diets, then to the oils in fish, and finally to eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA) and decosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in fish oils. Moreover, as the diet of the native
people from the north changes to modern food ways (such as less fish intake), the rates of
highblood pressure. elevated blood lipids. diabetes and obesity increases (Sienkiewicz et

al, 2012),

Omega 3 fatty acids are mainly found in fish oils. Marine plants can convert a-
linolenic acid (ALA) into EPA and DHA thus fish tissues are rich on these fatty acids

(Jennings and Akoh 2003). Fish is highly recommended to be part of a healthy diet. Some

studies stated that a diet that includes two meals of fatty fish each week can reduce death
and illness from heart disease, particularly in people suffering from heart attack. Most of
the studies on fish oils include different potential health benefits. It has been supported by
most of the studies the role of omega 3 against heart disease. Increasing intake of omega
3 PUFAs may reduce abnormal blood clotting, help sustain more regular heartbeats and
reduce inflammation of many body tissues, including the arteries of the heart. It also
helps in delaying the hardening of the arteries (atheresclorosis) and in relaxing the blood
vessels thus reducing blood pressure. On the other hand. the most accepted benefits of
fish oil are its effect in infant’s normal brain and vision development. DHA concentrates
in the brain’s cortex (conscious thinking part) while for the eyes. DHA helps form the

retina (seal of normal vision) (Sienkiewicz et al. 2012).

Omega 3 fatty acids are also proposed to fight against cancer but this statement
needs further investigation. It has been proposed that eicosanoids production from omega
3 instead of from omega 6 may be against the formation of cancer (Sienkiewicz et al

2012).

Omega 6 PUFA are precursors of the eicosanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxane.
certain leukotrienes) which are responsible for inflammation and arthritis. Omega 3
PUFA such as EPA inhibits the production of such eicosanoids by competing AA as
substrates for the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes that produce eicosanoids.
The excessive production of eicosanoids from omega 6 PUFA is precursors for

inflammation, immunosuppression. arthritis and thrombosis. Basically. Jennings and

Akoh (2003) stated that the omega 3 PUFA can reverse the adverse effects by lowering
the concentration of omega 6 in the phospholipid pools. With these, it has been postulated
that changing the dietary ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 PUFA may affect the

pathophysiology of chronic human diseases (Jennings and Akoh 2003).

Fatty Acid Calculations

Based on the FAO food composition data in calculating fatty acids with a given

weight, a conversion factor is needed because the total food in fat includes triglycerides.

phospholipids and unsaponifiable components like sterols (Table 1) (Greenfield and

Southgate 2003).

Table 1. Conversion factors to be applied to total fat to give values for fatty acids in fat

Pork

lean 0.910

Poultry 0.945,
Fish

20

To determine the total fatty acids in 100 g sample the total fat content of the

sample is multiplied by the conversion factor (Table 1) (Greenfield and Southgate 2003)

If the individual fatty acids are given, the values can be converted from g/100g
food basis to g/100g total fatty acids. The specific fatty acid in g/100g total fatty acids is
calculated as (Greenfield and Southgate 2003): (100/total fatty acids in 100 g sample) x

(g of specific fatty acid in 100 g sample).

If the data on fatty acids per 100 g total fatty acids and total fatty acids are given,
they can be converted to a g/100 g food basis as (Greenfield and Southgate 2003): (total

fatty acids in 100g sample) x (specific fatty acid in g/100g total fatty acid/100)

Dietary Recommendation on Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

It has been reported that there is convincing evidence that linoleic acid (LA) and
alpa-linolenic acid (ALA) are indispensable since they cannot be synthesized by humans.
thus, it is necessary to be supplemented by the diet. Some of its health benefits are widely
studied and currently FAO/WHO conclusion stated that there is convincing evidence that
replacing SFA with PUFA decreases the risk of Coronary Heart Disease. Moreover. there
is convincing and sufficient evidence from experimental studies to set an acceptable
intake to meet essential fatty acid for LA and ALA consumption. There is also possible
evidence that PUFA affect the risk of alterations in indices related to the metabolic

syndrome. There is possible evidence have been stated that between PUFA intake and

21

reduced risk of diabetes. However, regarding establishing any relationship of PUFA
intake with cancer and PUFA consumption and body weight and percent adiposity there

are still insufficient evidence (FAO/WHO 2008).

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for PUFA is 6 toll
% of energy intake. From the epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials of
CHD events, the minimum recommended level of total PUFA consumption for lowering
LDL and total cholesterol concentrations, increasing HDL cholesterol concentrations and
decreasing the risk of CHD events is 6 % of energy intake. However. based from the
experimental studies. the risk of lipid peroxidation may increase with high (>11 % of

energy) of PUFA intake, especially when tocopherol intake is low (FAO/WHO 2008).

It is recommended that 0.5 % to 0.6 % ALA per day corresponds to the
prevention of deficiency symptoms. The total n-2 fatty acid intake can range between 0.5
% to 2 % whereas the minimum dietary requirement of ALA (2 0.5 % of energy) for
adults prevents deficiency symptoms. There is evidence that the n -3 long chain
polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) may contribute to the prevention of CHD and
possibly other degenerative diseases of aging. For adult males and non pregnant/ non
lactating adult females 0.250 p/day of EPA plus DHA is recommended. For adult
pregnant and lactating females, the minimum intake for optimal adult health and fetal and
infant development is 0.3 pday EPA+DHA. of which at least 0.2 g/day should be DHA

(FAO/WHO 2008).

22

An estimated average requirement (EAR) for LA of 2 % of energy and an
adequate intake (Al) intake is 2.5 % to 9 % of energy. The higher value is attributed to be
part of a healthy diet contributing to long term health by lowering LDL and total
cholesterol levels and therefore the risk of CHD. For 6 to 12 months of age as well as
children 12 to 24 months of age. an Al range of 3.0-4.5 % of energy is recommended
with a upper level of acceptable macronutrient distribution range (U-AMDR) of <10 % of

energy (FAO/WHO 2008).

AA is not essential for a healthy adult as long as the habitual diet provides LA >
2.5 %. For infants 0 to 6 months, AA should be supplied in the diet within the range of
0.2-3.0 % of energy based on the human milk composition as a criteria (FAO/WHO

2008).

Based on the scientific evidence and conceptual limitations, there is no
compelling scientific rationale for the recommendation of a specific ratio of n-6 to n-3
fatty acids or LA to ALA, especially if intake of n-6 and n-3 fats lie within the

recommendations established in this report (FAO/WHO 2008).

Fish Lipids during Processing

Fish is preserved in different methods and this includes freezing. drying. smoking.

canning, etc. In many countries, the most common ways of preserving fish is drying.

23

Drying includes traditional methods (such as sun drying) and the controlled methods

(such as the use of cabinet dryers).

Lipids are prone to different biochemical changes such as oxidation. The
phospholipids are believed to be easily oxidized than the triglycerides and this also cause
the quality deterioration of most of the aquatic animal foods. Phospholipids have higher
level of unsaturation and have larger surface area thus prone to oxidation than neutral
lipids. There are compounds that are present in fish in particular that lead to oxidation;
these are the hemeproteins, radicals. iron and copper. These prooxidants particularly the
heme proteins are higher in the dark muscle. Heme proteins and myoglobin can lead high
levels of oxidation when the pH of the muscle decrease (during post mortem) or when
muscle are minced and these components are mixed in with lipids and oxygen. This
reaction leads to secondary products that causes unpleasant off odors and flavors which
may also affect the texture and color of the muscle. It has also been reported that lipid
oxidation can lead to protein denaturation or protein cross linking that causes textural
problems (such as muscle toughening and loss of water holding capacity) (Yui et al

2006).

In terms of thermal processing of fish. short term heating to 80 °C has been
reported to reduce oxidation due to inactivation of lipoxygenase. However, long term
heating may accelerate non enzymatic oxidation reactions. It has been reported also that
very high temperatures (550 °C) can lead to decomposition of fatty acids and thus

decreases its nutritional value. Cysteine proteases are responsible in extreme softening of

24

fish muscles in high temperatures. Moreover, heat stable alkaline proteases and neutral

proteases are active at 60 to 70 °C (Yui et al. 2006).

There are many ways in reducing lipid-derived quality problems (such as
oxidation and hydrolysis) to maintain or extend the sensory and nutritional qualities of
seafood products. The simplest means of controlling oxidation is through low
temperature which affects the rate of enzymatic reactions. Hydrolysis and oxidation will
be reduced if products are kept under extremely low frozen storage (below -40 °C) (Yui

et al. 2006)

Moreover, fish flesh particularly the dark muscle is rich in heme proteins. a
prooxidant, thus washing or the removal of dark muscle will remove this prooxidants.
The product should lessen the contact to oxygen thus modified atmosphere packaging is
necessary. It is noted that if fatty fish is used the oxygen should be totally removed.
Addition of antioxidants during processing can delay lipid oxidation reactions. A polar
and non polar antioxidants should be used, for example non polar: tocopherol (vitamin E)
and polar antioxidant: ascorbate (vitamin C) are commonly added. In addition, metal
chelators can also be added such as EDTA. When EDTA and ascorbate are added during

processing the ratio of the two should be greater than one (Yui et al. 2006).

25

Fish Drying

In developing countries such as Africa and Asia, almost 50 % of the fish catch is
dried. Drying is the conventional type of fish preservation. In fish drying, there are two
periods: constant rate period wherein drying rate depends on the speed at which water
leaves the fish surface which is affected by factors such as temperature, speed of air
movement and relative humidity of air; whereas falling rate period depends on the rate at
which water diffuses from the center of the fish to the surface which is affected by air
temperature, fat content, size of the fish and whether sliced or not. In drying, the moisture
content of fish decreases up to 25 % which limits the growth of microorganisms and
autolytic reactions. The product should reach a moisture content of 15 % to prevent

molds during storage (Unmole 1989).

There are traditional methods of drying such as sun drying on the ground, beaches
or rocks. Nowadays. developments are made to improve drying practices which includes
the use of solar or artificial dryers. Several advantages are brought by the use of solar

dryers than the traditional ones such as reduction of insect infestations or other forms of

contamination, increases storage life due to lower moisture content. not affected by
weather conditions and give products that have better quality based on texture. color and

flavor (Unmole 1989).

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY

Raw Materials

Four species of sardines such as Amblygaster sirm, Herklotsichthys
quadrimaculatus, Sardinella gibbosa and Sardinella lemuru were purchased at the public
market of Lemery, Batangas last June 2011. The sardine species were authenticated by a
professor from Zoology and Wildlife Section of the Museum and Natural History of the
University of the Philippines Los Bafios and by the National Fisheries and Research
Development Institute. For the preliminary study. the fatty acid profile analysis was
conducted on the four raw sardines to determine the species with the highest level of

DHA and EPA (Figure 6).

Fish Powder Processing

Fish Preparation

The species with the highest DHA and EPA content was processed into powder.
The fresh sardines were gutted to remove tail, entrails, skin and head and other non edible
portions. The fish was steamed for 15 minutes to cook the meat and to easily remove the
flesh from bones. The meat was minced; and then powdered turmeric.
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as metal chelators were added. The mixture was

ground with the addition of sufficient water to make a thick paste. Gum acacia and edible

28

gelatin in the form of 1 % solution in water were added to the mixture (Table 2) (Sen

2005).

Table 2. Recipe of fish paste

Drying

The thick paste were spread thinly on a tray and thoroughly dried in the cabinet
drier for five (5) hours at 65 °C until the moisture level of 5 % is achieved. The dried
paste was turned into powder using a blender. Finally. the powder (Figure 7) was packed

in polyethylene bags and sealed

Figure7. Fish powder: (a) unpackaged and (b) packaged powder

Chemical Analyses

To determine the effects of drying on the nutritional content, the fatty acid profile,
proximate composition, iron, calcium and zinc content of the raw and powdered
Amblygaster sirm were analyzed.

Fatty Acid Analysis (AOAC 1990)

Fat extraction. Fatty acid was separated and esterified using Boron Triflouride
Method.

Gas chromatography. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analyzed by Gas
Chromatography (GC). When the apparatus has stable baseline, 0.1 - 2 uL 5-10 %

30

heptanes solution of methyl esters was injected. For determination of acids <C)2, lower
colum temp. is needed; for >Czo. higher. Temperature programming is useful in such
cases, e.g. with acids <C,2, inject at 100° and raise temperature 4-8/min to optimum. or
program up to a fixed temperature and continue at constant temperature until all
components are eluted. For identification, the retention distances for known esters were
measured and plotted as function of number of atoms of acids. Ester appears in order of
increasing number of C atoms and of increasing unsaturation for same number of C

atoms.

Pro:

ate Analysis (AOAC 1980)

Moisture content determination. The evaporating dish was tared. One gram (1g) of
sample was weighed on the tared dish and placed in the vacuum oven to dry at 60°C for
S hours. After drying, the air of the oven was set at atmospheric pressure and the dish was
transferred to the dessicator to cool. The dish was reweighed and calculated for moisture

loss as follows:

(Weight of dish + sample) ~ (Weight of dish + sample)
% moisture = before drying after drying x 100
Weight of sample

Crude protein determination. Fish sample (0.5 gram) was placed in Kjeldahl
flask with 0.5 g selenium and 4 mL concentrated HjSO,. The solution was heated until it

became colorless. After heating the solution was transferred to the distillation set up and

31

added with 15 mL NaOH-NazS203. When enough distillate was collected, the contents of
the receiver were titrated with 0.1 HCI until the orange color appeared. Finally, the crude
protein was calculated as follows:
4
% N = (Sample Tittu, ~ Blank Tito) (Nuc) x 1000 x 100
Weight of sample in g

% Protein = %N x 6.25

Crude fat determination. About | g of ground air dried sample in a thimble was
dried for 2 hours in an oven at 105 °C. The thimble was inserted into the condenser for
extraction. The thimble was immersed in the petroleum ether and heated. When the
extraction is done and the solvent was recovered, the fat was dried for 30 minutes at 100

°C. After cooling, the crude fat was calculated.

% Crude Fat = Weight of tared cup + fat Weight of tared cup x 100
Weight of sample

Ash determination. About one to three grams (1 to 3 g) of sample was placed in
the tared evaporating dish and ignited slowly in an open flame and then placed in the

muffle furnace. The sample was ignited at $50 °C for 5 hours.

% Ash = (Weight of dish + residue) — (Weight of tared dish) x 100
Weight of sample


Mineral Analysis (AOAC 1980)

The sample was prepared through dry ashing. A gram of sample was brought to
ash for 2 hours at 500 °C. The sample was digested with HNO) and re-ash for | hour at
500 °C. The digest was transferred to the volumetric flask. A blank digest was carried out
in the same way. All minerals (iron, zinc and calcium) were determined using Atomic

Absorption Spectrometer against the standard stock solution (Appendix B).

Microbial Analysis

After the production of fish sprinkle. the product was further analyzed for its
microbial content to ensure the safety and quality of the product. Serial dilutions of the
sample were prepared following the standard pour plating technique. One mL (1 mL) of
appropriate dilutions were plated using plate count agar (PCA) and potato dextrose agar
(PDA) for enumeration of aerobic plate count and yeast and mold counts, respectively.
Triplicate plates were prepared and incubated upside down at 30 to 32 °C for 2 to 3 days.
Colonies were counted and reported as colony forming units per gram (cfwg) sample
(BAM 2001).

For Vibrio parahaemolyticus detection, the homogenized sample was prepared

using different dilutions. A loopful (10 il) of samples was streaked in thiosulfate citrate

33

bile salts TCBS agar. The plates were incubated upside down and development of blue

green colonies was observed (Downes and Ito 2001).

On the other hand, Salmonella detection was done by incubation of the
homogenized sample (25 g) in a sterile nutrient broth at 35 °C for 24 hours. The sample
drawn from the previous mixture was incubated on selenite broth at 35 °C for 24 hours.

Then a loopful (10 pl) of the sample was streaked on bismuth sulphite (BS) agar, xylose

lysine desoxycholate (XLD) agar, and Hektoen enteric (HE) agar plates and incubated at
35 °C for 24 hours. Appearance of black metallic sheen colonies at BS agar, blue-green to
blue colonies with or without black centers at HE agar and pink colonies with or without

black centers at XLD agar indicated presence of Salmonella (BAM 2011).

Lipid Oxidation (AOAC 1990)

Peroxide Value

The sample was placed in Erlenmeyer flask and added with 30 mL HOAc-CHCls
The mixture was dissolved and added with 0.5 mL KI solution, shaken for 1 minute and
added with 30 mL of H,0. The mixture was slowly titrated with 0.1 N NaS:O3 with
vigorous shaking until yellow color disappeared. The 1% starch solution was also added
during titration and shaking vigorously to release Iz from CHCls layer until blue color

disappeared. Conduct blank determination and calculate peroxide value as:

34

Peroxide value [milliequivalent (meq) Peroxide/kg sample] = S x N x 1000/g
sample,

where S = mL NaS20; and N = normality NaS203 solution

Free Fatty Acid (FFA)

Well mixed oil (about 7.05g) was placed in 250 mL flask and added with alcohol.
The solvent was neutralized while still hot by adding 0.1 N NaOH solution using
phenolphthalein indicator. The sample was titrated with 0.25 NaOH with vigorous
shaking until permanent faint pink appeared and persisted for > | minute. FFA was
calculated as:
FFA = _(mLxN)NaOHxp
Weight of sample, g

Where p = 28.2 (oleic acid)

Acid value = FFA x f

Where '= 1.99 (oleic acid)

Sensory Evaluation

After processing, the sensory attributes and acceptability of the powder were

evaluated for its color. odor. flavor. texture and general acceptability using a carrier.

carrier that was used was unflavored rice gruel. Three amounts of fish powder were
prepared, 2.5 %, 4.5 %, 9.5 % of 157 g (1/2 cup) unflavored rice gruel. A 9-point
Hedonic Scale Quality Scoring Test (Appendix F) was used to describe the sensory
attributes and acceptability of the product. Twenty-six panelists (26) were randomly
selected from the students and faculty of Food Science Cluster, College of Agriculture.

University of the Philippines Los Bafios, College, Laguna.

Statistical Analysis

The nutritional composition of raw sardines and the fish sprinkle was analyzed
using T-test to determine if drying process has significant effect on the nutritional content

of fish.

For the sensory evaluation. the data was analyzed using the Friedman test to
determine if there is significance between the three amounts of fish powder in terms of

color, odor, flavor, texture and general acceptability.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Fatty acid Profile of Different Sardine Species

The four species of sardines which are commonly available in Batangas Province are

Amblygaster sirm, Sardinella gibbosa, Sardinella lemuru and Herklotsichthys
quadrimaculatus Figure 8). These sardines are all coastal and pelagic fish.

Figure 8, Four sardine species: (a) Amblygaster sirm, (b) Sardinella gibbosa,
(©) Sardinella lemuru and (d) Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus

37

Fish are categorized based on their fat content as lean fish (fat less than 5 %),
medium fat fish (5 tol0 %) and fatty fish (fat more than 10 % by weight) (Sen 2005).
According to the classification, all of the fish samples were classified as medium fat fish

(Table 3).

Table 3. Fat content of four sardine species (edible portion, dry weight basis)

SARDINE SPECIES FAT CONTENT

Sardinella gibbosa 5.76
Sardinelta lemuru 5.03
Herklotsichhys quadrimaculatus 6.08

The principal fatty acid of the four sardine species are palmitic. stearic, myristic.
lignoceric, and the long chain PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (Table 4). Generally.
the dominant SFA in fish was palmitic; oleic was the highest among the MUFA while

DHA was the principal PUFA (Alasalvar et al. 2011).

Palmitic and stearic acids occur naturally in fish and in all animal fats and these
are the major products of fatty acid synthetase system. These fatty acids are also the
major metabolic energy for fish growth as well as oleic acid (Karapanagiotidis et al.

2010).

38

Oleic acid is the major monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and most of the fish
have high amounts because their diets are rich on oleic acid and they can also synthesize
them. For the wild fish such as these sardine species. MUFA content is generally lower
because of the limited energy intake and it is preferred substrate than the SFAs for energy

needs of fish (Karapanagiotidis et al. 2010).

Marine fish such as sardines are high in PUFAs specifically EPA and DHA
(Karapanagiotidis et al. 2010). This is mainly due to the dietary intake of marine fish on
zooplanktons which are good sources of PUFA (Suriah 1995). Likewise, the four sardine
species chiefly feed on zooplanktons such as larval bivalves and copepods (Whitehead

1985).

Marine plants can convert a-linolenic acid (ALA) into EPA and DHA thus fish
tissues are rich on these fatty acids. However, humans cannot convert oleic acid into
linoleic acid, LNA into ALA, or convert omega 6 PUFA to omega 3 PUFA (Jennings and
Akoh 2003), In addition, LNA conversion into PUFA (EPA and DHA) in human body is
not efficient wherein only 5 to 10 % is converted to EPA and 2 to 5 % to DHA (Gomez et
al. 2011). Thus, they are considered as essential and have to be obtained from food

(Jennings and Akoh 2003).

fish or seafood (with no added saturated fat) contains more than 60 mg of EPA and DHA

per 100 g (McManus and Nicholson 2010). The EPA+DHA content of Amblygaster sirm,

Sardinella gibbosa, Sardinella lemuru, and Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus was 698.77.

40

430.17, 267.35, 683.989 mg/100 g of raw edible portion, respectively. Thus, these four
sardine species are all good sources of omega 3 DHA and EPA. The presence of high
amount of DHA and EPA in all of the fish samples indicate that these fishes are healthy

to be part of the diet.

Proximate Compos

Moisture

The moisture content of raw Amblygaster sirm was 75.76 % (Table 5). This result
is in conjunction with the studies of Hale 1984; Portugal et al. 1997; Marin et al. 2010:
Bulla et al. 2011. The main content of the flesh of the fish is moisture which is up to 80
% (Unmole 1989). For the fatty fish the flesh contains about 70 % moisture (Murray and

Burt 1983).

The moisture content of sardine significantly decreased (p < 0.05) to 4.76 % after
drying (Table 5). The low moisture of the powdered fish was brought by dehydration due
to exposure to heat. For dried products, moisture content are greatly reduced to about 25
% or lower to minimize the growth of microorganisms such as molds that may deteriorate
the product (Unmole 1989). Most of the dried fish products compiled by Sen (2005) are

brought to the level of 10 % down to 5 %.

Protein

Dry fish contains about 50 to as much as 90 % protein (Sturtevant 1986). The
protein content of the raw sardine was 88.99 % and it decreased significantly (p < 0.05)
to 61.50 % in the fish powder. The processed fish powder contains different ingredients
other than the fish meat. The decrease in the protein content in fish powder was due to the
dilution of the concentration of fish protein because of other ingredients added to make
the fish powder (Appendix H). The protein in fish is of high nutritive value which is
comparable to meat protein (Caballero 2009). It also contains well-balanced ratio of
essential amino acids and easily digestible (with digestibility coefficient of nearly 100) by
the human body because of low collagen content (Caballero 2009). Results showed that
the processed powder is also a good source of protein. About 7 g of fish powder provides

4g protein which is equivalent to half serving of fish.

42

Fat

Results showed that the fat content of raw sardines (5.03 %) significantly
decreased in the powdered sample (4.65 %) (Table 5). The same result was also observed
in the study of Wu and Mao (2008). The decrease in the fat content after drying was
probably due to melting of fat during drying which could lead to leaching out of the fat

into the drying pan.

Ash

The ash content of raw sardine was 5.53 % which significantly increased to 15.86
% (Table 5). The result was in conjunction with the ash content of the sardine meal

(15.62 g/100 g) studied by Mesomya et al. (2002).

The increase in ash content of the powdered sardine can be attributed to the
ingredients added in making the fish powder. The ingredients such as garlic. onion.
turmeric powder contain minerals such as potassium. phosphorus. calcium, magnesium
and iron (Whitney et al. 2001) that contributed to the ash content of the finished product
Other ingredient such as salt was also a source of sodium which is also a mineral

(Appendix H).

43

Mineral Content

Results indicated that minerals iron, calcium and zinc content were maintained
after drying. Calcium and zinc of raw and powdered sardine have no significant
difference (Table 6). The same observation in a study of Ackurt (1991) and Gall et al.
(1983) showed that heat treatment had little or no effect on the minerals after thermal

processing. However. unlike zinc and calcium, iron increased significantly after drying.

In processing the fish powder, fish meat was minced then grounded to produce the
fish paste. Mincing and grinding damaged the integrity of the muscle membranes which
also altered the cellular compartmentalization. This disruption may released iron from
hemoglobin, ferritin and hemosiderin in fish muscles (Steele 2000; Sikorski and

Kolakowska 2011) thus could have increased the iron content in the fish powder.

From the latest nutrition survey. it was noted that calcium intakes of Filipinos are

inadequate. One of the good sources of calcium is the small fish such as sardines. The

44

fish powder contains 209.56 mg of calcium in every 40 g fish powder which is about 40
% of the calcium requirement of the children from one to three years old. On the other
hand, there is high prevalence of zinc deficiency in our country among infants and
preschoolers. Fish is considered as a fair source of zine (Joshi 2010). Based on the
Recommended Energy and Nutrient Intakes (RENI) for Filipinos, the zinc requirement of
the children (one to three years old) is 4.5 mg/day (FNRI-DOST 2002). Forty grams of
fish powder can contribute about 50 % (2.25 mg) of the zine requirement of the children
of the same age group. Moreover. iron deficiency anemia (IDA) remains the most
prevalent nutritional problem among Filipinos. There is 20.8 % prevalence of IDA among
1 to 5 years old children (FNRI-DOST 2008). About 20 g of fish powder can provide 100

% of the daily iron requirement (9 mg) of these children.

Fatty Acid Profile

In the raw sardines, the predominant saturated fatty acids were palmitic, stearic.
lignoceric; the major MUFA were palmitoleic and oleic while DHA. linoleic and
linolenic were the main PUFAs. Afler drying. the dominant saturated fatty acids were the
same as the raw sample while the MUFA and PUFA that only remained in the powder

were oleic and DHA, respectively.

Myristic and palmitic acid significantly decreased (p<0.05) while fatty acids such
as palmitoleic, linoleic. linolenic. nonadecaenoic, arachidic, EPA. behenic and nervonic

were totally removed after drying (Table 7). On the other hand, pentadecaenoic. oleic.

45

and lignoceric significantly increased (p<0.05) after drying. The amount of DHA, stearic
and heptadecaenoic of raw and powdered sardines did not change. The result was similar
with the study conducted by Weber et al. (2008) and Mahmoud et al. (2009) wherein

there are different effects on fatty acids of fish during heating: some decreased, some

increased and others did not change.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic, linolenic and EPA were not detected
after drying. PUFA are thermolabile compounds which are easily degraded through
oxidation during drying (Shah et al. 2009). However, DHA amount was maintained after
processing. It has been noted by Sikorski and Kolakowska (2011) that DHA is located at
the sn-2 position of triglyceride molecule and at this position it secured DHA from
oxidation. Moreover. in a study conducted by Aubourg et al. (1990) in albacore showed
that DHA in the sn-2 triglyceride position increased brought by cooking. Thus, in part.
this may explain the maintained level of DHA in the sardine even after drying into

powder,

To date, the recommended dietary intake for DHA has not been established. The
Institute of Medicine recommended DHA intake of 70 mg for children ages 1 to 3 years
old (Simopoulos and Bazan 2009). About 10 g fish powder can provide 100 % of daily
DHA requirement of the children of the same age group. This nutrient is important
particularly among the growing years of children (2 to 5 years of age). In one study it was
observed that including DHA in the diet is associated with higher scores on tests of visual
and neural development in children (Innis 2009). Fish powder can be an alternative way

of increasing the DHA consumption particularly among the Filipino children

47

Microbial Content of Fish Powder

The microbial analyses (Table 8) presented that fish powder had aerobic plate
count (APC) of 8.4 x10°and mold and yeast count of 3.0 x10, On the other hand, both

Salmonella and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were not detected in the powder.

There are very few studies about the incidence of food borne illness due to dried
fish thus standards on microbiological limit for this product are not suggested (ICMSF

1986),

Fish powder is consumed by mixing to different dishes while cooking or at the
end part of cooking. This kind of food item is nearly considered as ready-to-eat which is
defined as the food that can be consumed immediately at the point of sale (Center for
Food Society 2007). Comparing the fish powder against the microbial limits for
assessment of microbiological quality of ready-to-eat cooked fish, the powder belongs to
food quality Class A (Satisfactory) which indicates good microbiological quality (Gilbert
et al. 2000; Center for Food Society 2007). Class A classification in terms of aerobic
plate count (<10° cfu/g). Salmonella spp.( not detected in 25 g), Vibrio parahaemolyticus
(<20 cfu/g) (Gilbert et al 2000; Center for Food Society 2007) was met by the fish

powder

Drying is one of the commonest methods of preserving fish particularly in tropical
countries. In this process moisture is removed down to 25 % and below. The fish powder
was processed until the moisture content of 4.76 % was achieved. At this level of
moisture content, the growth and reproduction of microorganisms are inhibited. Avoiding
the microbial growth and other chemical reactions will help in preventing deterioration

and spoilage of the product during storage.

Rahman (2007) studied the microflora changes in tuna mince during convection
air-drying between 40 and 100 °C. The drying temperature of 50 °C or below showed no
lethal effect on the microflora and showed a significant growth, The drying temperature
of fish at or above 60 °C prevented microbial threat in the product. Likewise. higher
temperature (65 °C) was used in drying the fish powder in the cabinet dryer thus the
microbiological counts met the satisfactory criteria or in good microbiological quality as
discussed above. Moreover. convection drying is widely used due to its low cost of
equipment and operation compared to the ideal method of drying such as vacuum and

freeze-drying (Rahman 2007)

Lipid Oxidation of the Fish Powder

Fish lipids are very prone to oxidation. This lipid oxidation resulted into different
organoleptic problems in fish products such as rancidity (Rahman 2007). The common
indicator used in assessing rancidity development is by measuring the peroxide value
(Nielsen 2010). Peroxide value of the fish powder is 8.58 meq/kg. Rancidity is thought
to be noticeable in food products at levels between 20 to 40 meq/kg (Reilly 1985) and at

this level also indicates the initial stage of spoilage (Daramola et al. 2007).

Table 9, Peroxide Value and Free Fatty acid content of fish powder

SAMPLE PEROXIDE VALUE FREE FATTY ACID
(meg/kg) {as oleic acid), Yow/w_
Fish Powder 8.58 0.19

Another method used in determining lipid oxidation is by measuring free fatty
acids (FFA). FFAs are formed in foods as a result of hydrolytic rancidity which is the
extent of lipid hydrolysis by lipase action (Daramola et al. 2007). FFAs contribute to off-
flavor and the rancidity is noticeable when the FFA (calculated as oleic acid) is in
between 0.5 to 1.5 % (Daramola et al. 2007). According to Huss (1988). high level of
FFA is an indication of microbial spoilage activity. The free fatty acid (as oleic acid) of

the fish powder was 0.19 % which is below the upper limit.

The product was considered in good quality since the peroxide value and the free
fatty acid level is below the upper limit of 20 meq/kg peroxide value and 0.5 % of free

fatty acids.

Sensory Evaluation

Different level of fish powder such as 2.5 %, 4.5 % and 9.5 % of % cup (157 g)
unflavored thin rice gruel were evaluated for different sensory attributes such as color,

fishy odor, fish flavor. and texture and for its general acceptability.

Color

Majority of the panelists (61.54 %) said that 2.5 % fish powder is extremely light
yellow in color, 4.5 % fish powder was light yellow (50 %) and 9.5 % fish powder is
yellow (88.46 %) (Table 10). The yellow color of the powder was due to the added
turmeric powder in fish powder formulation. Turmeric contains a coloring pigment called
curcumin. This coloring pigment is widely used as natural colorant in different food items
such as in fish and fish products (Stankovic 2004). After processing the curcumin is
maintained because it is stable to heat and in dried food (Stankovic 2004) like the fish
powder. The three level of fish powder were significantly different from each other

(p<0.05) (Table 11). The intensity of the yellow color in the rice gruel was affected by

sl

the quantity of the fish powder added. Expectedly, the higher the quantity of the fish

powder the more intense was the yellowing of the gruel.

Fish Odor

Extremely fish odor was detected in 9.5 % level of fish powder by most of the
panelists (88.46 %), 4.5 % fish powder was considered mostly by the panelists (53.85 %)
with fishy odor while 2.5 % fish powder was determined by almost half of the panelist
(53.85 %) with extremely weak fish odor (Table 10). Each level of fish powder was
significantly different from each other (p<0.05) (Table 11). Increasing the amount of the
fish powder mixed with the rice gruel also increased the fish odor detected by the

panelists.

Fish Flavor

The panelists preferred 2.5 % fish powder with extremely weak fish flavor while
the highest quantity of powder added (9.5 %) had the extremely fish flavor (Table 10).
The fish flavor can be attributed to the carbonyl compounds resulted from oxidation of
polyunsaturated fatty acids by lipoxygenase or by autoxidation. The skin of the sardine
contains high amount of PUFA and lipoxygenase which produces carbonyl compounds
(Ganeko et al. 2007). The fish flavor of the rice gruel were affected by the amount of fish

powder added (p<0.05) (Table 11)

Off Odor and Off Flavor

‘Among the three amounts of fish powder, 2.5 % was detected by most of the
panelists (88.46 %) without off odor and off flavor. On the other hand, 9.5 % fish powder
had the highest number of panelist who considered the samples for having off odor

(46.15 %) and off flavor (34.62 %) (Table 10)

Texture

Grittiness of fish powder in the rice gruel was evaluated. Sardines are considered
as bony fish. The gritty texture can be attributed to the small bones from sardines that
were included during processing. The lowest amount of fish powder added (2.5 %) had
extremely less gritty texture, 4.5 % fish powder had gritty texture while 9.5 % fish

powder had extremely gritty texture based from 50 %, 80.77 %. and 65.38 % of the

34

panelists, respectively (Table 10). These three concentrations were significantly different
from each other (p<0.05) (Table 11). The more fish powder added in the gruel, the

greater the amount of bone particles incorporated in the mixture.

General Acceptability

In terms of general acceptability, each amount of fish powder added in the gruel
was not significantly different from each other (p < 0.05) (Table 11). However, the
amount of 4.5 % fish powder can be considered as the adequate amount to be added in
157 g of thin rice gruel because this was scored as moderately liked by most of the
panelists (53.85 %) (Table 10). Conversely, 2.5 % and 9.5 % fish powder were mostly

evaluated as slightly liked and moderately disliked, respectively.

jonal Value of Fish Powder

The nutrient claims of a certain food can be classified according to the nutrient
content. Based from Codex Alimentarius (2007). food is considered as a source of protein
when the protein content is 10 % of the Nutrient Reference Values (NRV) per 100 g
while it is a high source when the protein content is > 20 % of NRV per 100 g. On the
other hand, food containing > 15 % of the vitamins and minerals of NRV per 100 g is

termed as a source. However. food with > 30 % of the vitamins and minerals of NRV per

35

100 g is labeled as a high source. In the Philippines, NRV that can be used is the RENI

since it is the current dietary standard in the country.

Fish powder per 100 g can contribute more than 20 % of protein and more than 30
% of iron, zinc and calcium requirement of all age group thus it is a high source of these
nutrients. Fish powder per 100 g contains 61.5 g of protein (Table 5), 41.84 mg of iron,

5.63 mg of zinc and 523.09 mg of calcium (Table 6).

In terms of omega 3 DHA, it contains about 687.59 mg of DHA per 100 g. The
powder cannot be considered as a good source of omega 3 since the criteria for this claim
is that the food per 100 g should contain 60 mg or more of DHA+EPA (McManus and

Nicholson 2010). However, after drying EPA was not detected in the fish powder.

Nutritional Contribution of Fish Powder to
Children (6 Months to 5 Years Old)

Fish powder is suitable to be part of the complementary food of the growing
children (from 6 months to 5 years old). The complementary foods that are commonly
given to the children are plant-based (Perlas and Gibson 2005). Similarly, based from the
FNRI (2008) survey. foods that are commonly consumed by the children of this age
group are mostly carbohydrates such as rice, sugar. bread. instant noodles. ete. These
foods are not enough and may predispose the children to inadequate intake of nutrients
such as protein, iron, calcium and zinc. It is important to supplement the plant-based food
with meats such as fish in feeding the children because these protein foods have nutrients

that are essential for their growth and development.

The fish powder is intended to be consumed by mixing with other dishes such as
rice gruel. From the sensory evaluation. it was shown that amount of fish powder added
in the gruel with the highest acceptability score was 4.5 % which is equivalent to 7 g of

fish powder.

About 7 g of fish powder can contribute about 30.75 %, 15.38 % and 11.33 % of
the daily protein requirement of 6 to 12 months. 1 to 3 and 4 to 5 years old children,
respectively (Table 13). Protein is necessary for growth and maintenance of different
body structure such as skin. muscles, organs and bones (Whitney et al. 2001). Twenty-
four percent (24 %) of the protein intake of infants from 6 to 12 months is used for

growth (Edelstein and Sharlin 2009). Fish protein is a good source of protein because it

57

contains all the essential amino acids (Edelstein and Sharlin 2009). Moreover, it is high in
lysine, methionine, cysteine which are limiting amino acids in cereal based diets
(Edelstein and Sharlin 2009). Fish powder can add significant amount of quality protein
when added in the rice gruel or other complementary food commonly consumed by the

children.

Iron deficiency is the most common childhood deficiency worldwide (Edelstein
and Sharlin 2009). Based from the 7" National Nutrition Survey in 2008, Iron Deficiency
Anemia affects 2 out of 10 children 6-months to five years old. IDA causes fatigue.
weakness, poor immunity and also related to poor learning ability and behavioral
problems especially among children (Whitney et al. 2001; Banda-Nyirenda 2009), The
main sources of iron from the complementary foods in infants are the animal based-food
such as fish (Edelstein and Sharlin 2009). Fish contains heme iron which are better
absorbed than the iron from infant cereals (Edelstein and Sharlin 2009). Moreover. fish
like other meat can enhance the absorption of non heme iron from plant based food

(Edelstein and Sharlin 2009). The most acceptable level of fish powder, 7 g. can

58

contribute 29.29 % to 32.54 % of the daily iron requirement of children 6 months to 5

years old (Table 13).

Zinc, on the other hand, plays an important role in the child growth. One of the
specific roles of zinc is its association in the concentration of circulating insulin-like
growth factor-1 which is the principal growth factor that controls early childhood growth
(Caballero 2009). Zine bounded to animal protein such as in fish is more readily absorbed
in the body. Giving infants of complementary foods of animal-based such as fish improve
zine intake and bioavailability (Edelstein and Sharlin 2009). Fish powder contains 0.39
mg of zine per 7 g. This can supply the 7.30 to 9.38 % of the zinc requirement of the

children from 6 months to 5 years old per day.

Calcium is essential in the formation and mineralization of bones (Whitney et al
2001). During bone formation, calcium salts form crystals and as crystals become denser
they strengthen the maturing bones. This is very evident on the leg of the children that
can support their body when they begin to walk (Whitney et al. 2001). There are non milk
calcium food sources, one of which is the bony fish like sardines, Moreover, the calcium
in fish is easily absorbed in the body like the calcium in milk (Hansen 1998). Seven
grams (7 g) of fish powder contains 36.62 mg of calcium, which can contribute 6.66 to

9.15 % of the calcium requirement of the children per day.

According to WHO/FAO (2008) there is a convincing role in brain and vision
development particularly among children 0 to 24 months of age. Basically, DHA is the

major structural fat in the human brains and eyes wherein 97 % of all omega 3 fatty acid

59

in the brain is DHA while 93 % in the eye (Greenberg 2008). Moreover, uptake of
preformed DHA by the brain is significant between ages 2 and 5 and supports the
substantial accumulation of DHA by the brain during this critical growth period
(Martinez 1992). The DHA intake of children 1 to 5 years old is inadequate primarily
because the main sources of DHA such as fish are not commonly given to the children
and the DHA-fortified foods are limited (IOM 2005). The Institute of Medicine
recommended DHA intake of 70 mg for children ages | to 3 years old (Simopoulos and
Bazan 2009). Fish powder can provide about 48 % of the DHA requirement of these

children,

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Sardine species namely Amblygaster sirm, Sardinella gibbosa, Sardinella lemuru,
Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus that are commonly caught from Batangas contained
significant amount of omega 6 and omega 3 DHA and EPA. Amblygaster sirm had the
highest amount of DHA and EPA thus the species was further studied and processed into
powder. Results showed that raw and powdered Amblygaster sirm were not only a

source of protein but also of other nutrients. Specifically the study showed that:

1. The moisture, protein and fat content of the fish decreased after drying while the
ash content increased in the fish powder.

2. The calcium and zinc content of sardine were maintained after drying while iron
increased significantly in the fish powder.

3. The omega 3 DHA was the only polyunsaturated fatty acid that was maintained
after drying.

4. The microbial counts (aerobic plate count, yeast and molds, Salmonella, and
Vibrio parahaemolyticus) were within the acceptable limit. thus, fish powder was
safe for consumption. The peroxide value and the free fatty acid level were below
the upper limit of 20 meq/kg and 0.5%. respectively. thus the product was in good
quality.

5. Addition of 4.5 % level of fish powder in 157 g rice gruel was the most acceptable

and evaluated as moderately liked by the taste test panelists,

62

Fish powder is a high source of protein, calcium, iron and zine for children 6
months to 5 years old. It also contains omega 3 DHA. Fish powder is a nutrient dense

powdered mix thus can serve as a good complementary food for the children.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The development of dried fish powder from a low cost sardine mainly aimed to
preserve the nutritional content of the raw sardine particularly its macronutrient and

micronutrients such as minerals iron, zinc, calcium and the DHA.

The drying process in making the fish powder should be optimized in terms of
different parameters that may conserve more of its nutrients particularly the omega 3
PUFA. Proper processing must ensure different ways in preventing or minimizing
initiation of lipid oxidation in raw materials, during processing and in the final product.
Aside from these, further research is needed in developing fish powder using different

methods of drying other than conventional drying.

The product's sensory qualities particularly on its odor and flavor can be further
improved to reduce or totally remove the fishy odor and flavor. Moreover, the shelf life
of the product and the effect of storage conditions on the nutritional composition and
sensory attributes of the fish powder must be further studied. The appropriate packaging

material of the product that will best maintain its quality should also be studied.

Sardines and other fish are available and affordable in most part of the country.
However, the way of presenting it on the table and how it can be willingly appreciated by
the growing children challenges most of the household mothers. Other underutilized fish
in country can also be developed into different products that will help in nourishing

growing Filipino children,

D. Performance Specifications
Perform analysis on mixture of Me stearate and Me oleate in equal
proportions, Adjust sample size, column temperature and carrier gas flow
so that Me stearate peak is recorded 15 min after solvent peak, % scale.
Measure base widths in mm of Me stearate (w,) and Me oleate (ws)
between points of curves. Also, measure retention distance in mm (S)
from start to peak maximum for Me stearate and distance in mm between
peak maximum from Me stearate and Me oleate, Y. Calc theoretical plates.

linoleic acid (18:3) Me ester should be eparated from arachidic acid (20:0)
and gadoleic acid (20:1) esters. Columns will show gradual loss in R with
use; when value becomes < 1.25, replace.
E. Determination
With app. showing stable baseline. inject 0.1 - 2 pL 5-10 %
heptane solution of Methyl esters. Pierce septum of inlet port and quickly
discharge sample. Withdraw needle and note on chart small peak due to
air or solvent, marking start reference point. Adjust sample size so major
peak is not attenuated >8x, preferably less. Change setting of attenuator as
necessary to keep peaks on chart paper. Mark attenuator setting on chart.
For determination of acids <C,2. lower colum temp. is needed: for
>Cro, higher. Temperature programming is useful in such cases. e.g. with
acids <C)2. inject at 100°C and raise temperature 4-8/min to optimum, or
program upto a fixed temperature and continue at constant temperature
until all components are eluted.
F. Identification
Analyze reference standard mixtures under same operating
conditions as for sample. Measure retention distances (S) for known esters.
Plot log S$ as function of no. of C atoms of acids. Under isothermal
conditions, graphs straight lines. approx. parallel. Identify peaks from
sample from these graphs, interpolating if necessary.

Ester appear in order of increasing no. of C atoms and of
increasing unsaturation for same no. of C atoms. Cig is ahead of Cig, and
Cig Me esters appear in order: stearate (18:0), oleate (18:1), linoleate
(18:2), linoleate (18:3). Czo saturated ester (arachidic, 20:0) usually
appears before 18:3 ester, but may be reversed on some columns, or
positions may change with column use.

G. Calculations

If instrument is equipped with integrator, use figures shown. If not
use triangulation: Draw lines fro each peak tangent to sides and
intersecting baseline. Calc. area of resulting triangle by multiplying ht
(corrected fro any change in attenuation) by ¥% base. For automatically
attenuated peak, obtain peak width by drawing tangents to outer sides of
peak (these must be full chart span, ad upper 2/3 peak must be used) and
intersecting baseline. Calc. area by multiplying height (corrected for
attenuation) by ¥% base.

If significant amounts of components with <12 C atoms are absent.
calculate % weight of each component, expressed as Me ester,

Ci=Gix 100/26,
where G; = area of peak corresponding to component i, and 2G;
under all peaks.

In certain cases e.g. in presence of components with <12 C atoms.
large differences in molecular weights, and presence of secondary groups.
correction factors must be used to convert peak areas into weight %. Det.
Correction factors by analyzing known reference standards of Me esters of
composition similar to that of sample under identical operating conditions.
For reference standards,

% by weight component i = B, x 100/YB,

Where B, = weight of component i in reference standard. and YB, =
total weight of all components in reference standard. Calculate from
chromatogram:

% (area/area) of component i = G; x 100/XG,

B. Procedure
Sample preparation
1. Analyze 25-50 g from each subsample
2. Add appropriate amount of 0.1% peptone water to the weighed sample
to achieve 10" dilution, then homogenize in a stomacher for 2 min
(Alternatively, blending for 30-60 sec can be used but is less effective.
Make appropriate 1:10 (1+9) dilutions in 0.1% peptone water).
Plating and incubation of sample

1. Use sterile cotton-plugged pipet to place 1.0 ml portions of sample
dilution into pre-labeled 15 x 100 mm Petri plates (plastic or glass). and
immediately add 20-25 ml tempered DG18 agar.

2. Mix contents by gently swirling plates clockwise. then counterclockwise.
taking care to avoid spillage on dish lid.

3. After adding sample dilution, add agar within 1-2 min; otherwise. dilution
may begin to adhere to dish bottom (especially if sample is high in starch
content and dishes are plastic) and may not mix uniformly

4, Plate each dilution in triplicate.

87

5. Incubate plates in the dark at 25 °C. Do not stack plates higher than 3 and

do not invert.

Note: Let plates remain undisturbed until counting.

Counting of plates

Count plates after 5 days of incubation. If there is no growth at 5 days, re-
incubate for another 48 h. Do not count colonies before the end of the
incubation period because handling of plates could result in secondary
growth from dislodged spores, making final counts invalid. Count plates
containing 10-150 colonies. If mainly yeasts are present, plates with 150
colonies are usually countable. However, if substantial amounts of mold are
present, depending on the type of mold, the upper countable limit may have
to be lowered at the discretion of the analyst. Report results in colony
forming units (CFU)/g or CFU/ml based on average count of triplicate set.
Round off counts to two significant figures. If third digit is 6 or above, round
off to digit above (e.g.. 456 = 460); if 4 or below, round off to digit below
(e.g., 454 = 450). If third digit is 5, round off to digit below if first 2 digits
are an even number (e.g,, 445 = 440); round off to digit above if first 2 digits
are an odd number (e.g., 455 = 460). When plates from all dilutions have no
colonies, report mold and yeast counts (MYC) as less than 1 times the lowest
dilution used.

Isolate individual colonies on PDA or MA, if further analysis and species
identification is necessary.
