ABSTRACT
The present study was designed to determine the susceptibility of nine (9) field-collected populations of German cockroach, Blattella germanica L. to five (5) different classes of insecticide: organophosphates, carbamates, synthetic pyrethroids, phenyl pyrazoles, and
neonicotinoids. One representative chemical from each class was selected: Dichlorovinyl
Dimethyl Phosphate (DDVP) from organophosphates, propoxur from carbamates, α-cypermethrin
from synthetic pyrethroids, fipronil from phenyl pyrazoles and thiamethoxam from neonicotinoids.
The six-week-old nymphs of German cockroach were bio-assayed against these insecticides using
the WHO glass jar method, with slight modifications, to determine the LC₅₀ values and slope after conducting probit analysis. The two most toxic chemicals were fipronil and thiamethoxam. Propoxur was more toxic
than a-cypermethrin. DDVP was consistently the least toxic against German cockroaches coming
from all collection sites. This suggests that the older classes (OPs, carbamates and pyrethroids)
which have been used through time have shown reduced efficacy against German cockroach compared to the newer compounds.

INTRODUCTION

The German cockroach, Blatiella germanica (Linnaeus) (Blattodea: Ectobiidae) is an
important household insect pest and is commonly found in bakeries, restaurants, and kitchens
worldwide (Gadd and Raubenheimer 2000; Lee and Lee 2000). Aside from its economic
importance, the German cockroach is a significant health hazard, serving as a mechanical vector
and reservoir for pathogenic agents (Pridgeon et al. 2002). It contaminates food by carrying filth
and microbial pathogens on body and legs (Watanabe et al. 2003; Fasulo et al. 2005). Examples
of major allergic reactions in humans are asthma, itching, swelling of eyelids, dermatitis, and
severe respiratory problems (Sarinho et al. 2004; Pechal et al. 2007). There is little information on
incidence of cockroach-related diseases in the Philippines but Sia Su et. al (2016) reported that
common parasite observed from the cockroach collected from the streets of Metro Manila, Pasay
City and Quezon city was rhabditiform larvae - the major causative agent of strongyloidiasis in
humans.

Urbanization provides opportunity and favorable conditions for the rapid increase of B.
germanica (Hill 2002). The proximity of living quarters in most urban centers allows German
cockroach to spread easily. This is exacerbated by factors like overcrowding, inefficient waste
disposal, and poor building structure. Thus, the need for urban pest control has come from a
common realization that presence of B. germanica represents unhygienic condition causing
problems for residents and commercial businesses.

‘When one mentions pest control, the immediate reaction of many is to refer to chemical

method of control or the use of chemical poisons to kill the German cockroach population. What

as chemical pesticides especially when used together in an integrated pest management approach.
There are five general categories of control methods practiced by non-professional individuals and
the pest control operators (PCOs). These include the cultural control, physical control and
mechanical control, biological control, and chemical control methods. Cleanliness and sanitation

are results of good cultural practices. Valles (1996) discussed that by eliminating food and water

sources and clutter, the infestation and population of German cockroaches decreased significantly.
In physical and mechanical method, sticky traps and electrified traps can be used to monitor and
reduce population size of B. germanica (Ballard and Gold 1984). Biological control is also gaining
importance as one strategy against cockroaches. There are reports that B. germanica populations
and other species of cockroach have been successfully reduced in certain locations by introducing
parasitic wasp Aprostecetus hagenowii which oviposits in egg cases of pest organism (Cook
Islands Biodiversity Database 2016).

Although all these control methods are considered crucial components in the control of
German cockroach, the use of insecticides is still the most popular and effective method so far
(Lee and Robinson 2001). The review on B. germanica by Jacobs (2013) indicated that the use of
baits containing hydramethylnon, fipronil, sulfluramid, boric acid or abamectin is an effective
chemical method. Insecticidal dusts such as boric acid, silica aerogel and diatomaceous earth can
provide additional contro! while residual sprays or aerosol foggers are of little value and may
disperse B. germanica.

In the Philippines, recommended insecticides against cockroaches belong to the following

insecticide groups: organophosphates, carbamates, synthetic pyrethroids, neonicotinoids,

avermectins, phenyl pyrazoles, oxadiazines and hydramethyInon. These are currently marketed

and supplied by agrochemical companies whether as proprietary products or commodity products.
Some household chemicals are displayed in groceries, hard wares, and drugstores as part of their
marketing and promotion campaign. Moreover, these insecticides must be registered with the
Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before offered for sale and use. As a requirement
for the issuance of certificate of product registration (CPR) for household or urban pesticides, local
bio-efficacy must be conducted to prove its effectivity against cockroaches. With the use of FDA-
registered chemicals, regular insecticide application by the homeowners or hired pest control
operators (PCO) is the common strategy for control of German cockroach. In most cases,
treatments are applied to sites where cockroaches have been observed and where they are suspected
to be living. Aside from CPR, PCOs'’ criteria in choosing chemicals for German cockroach control
include the price of the product and safety to human and environment.

However, problems or concems encountered to effectively eliminate the German
cockroaches include their being closely associated with food and people, their rapid reproduction,
and their tendency to gather in inaccessible places, The German cockroach has also been reported

to have developed resistance against many groups of insecticides. This problem transcends

geographical regions (Ladonni 2001; Pai et al. 2005) and different classes of insecticides
(Holbrook et al. 1999). Moreover, Lee et al. (1996), Lee and Lee (2002) and Ahmad et al. (2009)
reported that insecticide resistance is prevalent in Southeast Asia such as Singapore, Malaysia, and

Indonesia. With these factors affecting efficacy of insecticides, the PCOs need more information

to address the concerns of their clients on cockroach control.

Much of the works on insecticide efficacy and insecticide resistance on the German

cockroach were done in other countries and very little or no data are available in the Philippines.

The only available literature was done by Mendoza (1976) who reported some chemical control
on adult German cockroaches with notes on its biology. Furthermore, the separate studies
conducted by Verdeprado (2008) and Jarilla (2010) focused on the effectiveness of commercial
bait formulation containing indoxacarb as compared to regular diet inside bait station.

Studies conducted in the laboratory usually use adult male cockroach (Koehler and
Patterson 1988) but the late instar six-week-old B. germanica nymphs were also used. The latter
had been found to be significantly more tolerant to insecticides, including pyrethroids, carbamates,
and organophosphate than adult males and females in topical and residual bioassays (Koehler et

al. 1993; Valles et al.1994; Qian et al. 2010).

The present study sought to determine the susceptibility of the six-week-old German
cockroach nymphs to five (5) commercially available insecticide with different active ingredients
commonly used by local pest control operators. These five insecticides were selected to represent
the five groups of insecticides: namely, organophosphates, carbamates, synthetic pyrethroids,
phenyl pyrazoles, and neonicotinoids. The data generated by the biological assays can then be used
to guide non-professional applicators and PCOs in their choice of pesticides against German
cockroach and to serve as baseline information in future studies to detect possible resistance of
German cockroach populations to these insecticide groups. Field monitoring is essential to

determine whether tolerant or resistant in

uals are already present in the field. Monitoring of

local cockroach populations is essential for effective control of Blattella germanica by households

and establishments with or without hiring PCOs and for insecticide resistance programs. The

specific objectives of the study are:

1) To determine the toxicity of five available commercial insecticides to nine populations

of B. germanica collected from three towns of Laguna using LCso values,

2) To establish the slope of different insecticides against field-populations of B.

germanica in the laboratory using residual contact method and,

3) To identify the most effective insecticide group used in the study against the nine field-

collected populations of B. germanica.

This research was conducted at the Toxicology Laboratory. Institute of Weed Science,
Entomology and Plant Pathology, College of Agriculture and Food Science, University of the

Philippines Los Bafios, Laguna from February 2019 to April 2020.

REVIEW OF LITERATURE

OVERVIEW

This chapter is composed of six sections. The first one is the general background of the

test insect, the German cockroach (Blattella germanica), its biology, and i

life cycle; followed
by its public health importance as nuisance and carrier of diseases. To help solve this pest problem,
control measures are briefly discussed such as environmental management, physical and
mechanical control methods, biological control method and the chemical control method. Under
the last control method, different types of application were presented. There is also a section on
specific approaches of pest control operators (PCOs) against cockroaches. The urban pest control
industry is responsible in handling the German cockroach problem because of the expertise and
professionalism of PCOs. However, PCOs face serious problem due to failure of control against
B. germanica. One reason is the possible development of insecticide resistance, and this was
described in the fifth section. Lastly, to investigate the possible resistance or susceptibility of

German cockroaches, an appropriate bioassay technique was reviewed.

German cockroach, Blattella germanica (Linnaeus)

The German cockroach, Blattella germanica (Linnaeus) is one of the most common
cockroach species. They are small, with adult measuring about 10-15 mm in length. They have
flattened, boat-shaped body while possessing fully developed wings covering the abdomen. The
wings are functional but usually used for downward flight. They are light yellowish brown with
two dark longitudinal bands on their pronotum near the head. Their head is oriented downward
and not much visible from above due to an extended pronotum covering the head. Their
filamentous antennae are longer than their body (Capinera 2004).

The German cockroach is a paurometabolous insect with three life stages: egg, nymph, and
adult. The ootheca (egg capsule) which is produced by the accessory glands of female cockroaches
encloses the eggs (Cochran 2003). The ootheca is light brown in color and about 7-9 mm in length.
According to Mendoza (1976), sexually mature females produce the first ootheca in about 11 to
12 days. They carry the ootheca for 10 to 17 days until the eggs are hatched. Ross and Mullins
(1995) reported that females may also drop the egg capsule within a short time before hatch. After
ootheca deposition, the females continue to copulate several times to produce additional ootheca.
The observed shortest time in which two oothecae are laid is 22 days. Mendoza (1976) reported
that on the average, females can produce six egg capsules throughout their life span. Each ootheca
contains 30 to 48 eggs (Capinera 2004).

After deposition, the egg capsule splits along the seam and then young cockroaches escape.
The newly hatched cockroaches work their way out by pulling their antennae and legs free from

individual eggshell. The young cockroaches are initially whitish in color but gradually turn brown

after one to two hours. The nymphs go through a total of six molts to reach maturity wherein each
stadium lasts for eight days, with a total of 48-day developmental period. Figure | shows the life

cycle of B. germanica based on laboratory study done by Mendoza (1976)

Public Health Importance

Nuisance

The German cockroach shares food, water, warmth, and shelter with humans. According
to Capinera (2004), they consume same food with humans as well as dead plant or animal
materials, leather, glue, wallpaper, fabrics, books, and feces. Contamination of the food is one of
the damages caused by cockroach They contaminate food by crawling around and defecating on it
or by leaving cast exuviae (insect’s old skin), empty egg cases or insect cadavers in foodstuffs or
by regurgitating saliva and intestinal fluids from their mouths while feeding. They also discharge
a rancid secretion from their mouths and gland opening on their body resulting to a long-lasting,

offensive cockroach smell to areas or food visited by them.

Carrier of Diseases

German cockroaches also serve as vector of pathogens, cause allergic reactions and
psychological distress (Brenner 1995). They are proven and suspected carriers of organism causing
diarthea, dysentery, cholera, leprosy, plague, typhoid fever, and viral diseases such as
poliomyelitis (WHO 2006). There were also accounts of cockroaches entering body orifices such
as ears and nose. Moreover, inhalation of a few protein fractions found in cockroach secretions,
body parts and excrement by sensitive individuals can cause asthma and allergic response such as
skin rashes, watery eyes, and sneezing (Capinera 2004; Cochran 2003). There is little information
on incidence of cockroach-related diseases in the Philippines but Sia Su et. al (2016) reported that

common parasite observed from the cockroach collected from the streets of Metro Manila, Pasay

10

City and Quezon City was rhabditiform larvae - the major causative agent of strongyloidiasis in

humans.

Control Measures against German Cockroach

Effective control is easier in temperate countries than in tropical areas because the
cockroach populations cannot survive outdoors in winters in the former. The limiting factor for
surviving appears to be cold temperature and B. germanica is unable to survive in locations away
from humans or human activity (Valles 1996). Crucial to effective control is cleanliness since
infestation of B. germanica is aggravated by poor hygiene. In Iran, Shahraki et al. (2011) stressed
the importance of sanitation and sanitary factors against the infestation of B. germanica and
discussed the effectiveness of educational program on sanitation. The use of pamphlets, posters,
and lectures were utilized to describe the importance of sanitation which led to reduction of
infestation. The major control measures against the German cockroach are listed below, and some

are lifted from World Health Organization (2006).

Environmental management

Cleanliness and Hygiene. \t is the first step in cockroach prevention. Good and detailed
sanitation are important components of successful pest control work. Hiding spots, food, and water
available at night must be eliminated by cleaning the kitchen, reducing the clutter, throwing away

dead cockroaches and cleaning the frass and areas where there are cockroaches with simple soap

u

and water. According to Valles (1996), the removal of food sources, debris and potential clutter

lessen the B. germanica population and the risk of encouraging new infestations.

Reduction of accessibility. \n this method, peeled wallpapers, shelf liners, cracks, and holes

where cockroaches could get through must be sealed or fixed though use of silicone caulk, copper
mesh, screens, and door sweeps. Jacobs (2013) noted that B. germanica are smaller than other
cockroach species and can conceal themselves in many places inaccessible to larger species; thus,
sealing cracks and crevices can be effective in reduction of harborage space and its population
size. Consequently, openings for drain water and sewer pipes, drinking water and electricity cables

should also be closed.

Physical and Mechanical Controt
The use of sticky traps and electrified traps can monitor and reduce the population size of
B. germanica (Valles 1996). Vacuuming technique is another method on German cockroach

control. Although vacuuming will not kill the insects but at least they will not be able to escape.

Vacuuming up icant dent in B.

ible cockroaches and in their hiding places will make sig

germanica population providing increase chance of success during treatment. Kaakeh and Benneth
(1997) reported that sticky traps and vacuuming technique were effective as monitoring devices
and provided acceptable control of B. germanica. Moreover, thermal remediation treatment as one

example of physical control method is gaining popularity against B. germanica. This method

works by heating the residential or commercial properties up to 140 F and maintaining that

temperature for up to four hours allowing the treatments to reach even the hard-to-reach areas.

Biological Control

According to Suiter (1997), pathogens and in particular fungi appear to be the most
promising biological control against B. germanica. The study of Ren et al. (2005) reported the
successful infection of Metarhizium anisopliae against B. germanica under laboratory conditions.
‘The infected cockroaches showed erratic movements while hyphae of the fungi were found in most
body parts of B. germanica after 4-5 days of infection. Other reported symptoms of infection of
M. anisopliae are sub-lethal effects such as reduction in mean number of oothecae laid by females,
cothecal production, hatchability, and nymphal production (Quesada-Moraga et al. 2004).
Meanwhile, the parasitic wasp Aprostocetus hagenowii have also been used as biological agent by
laying its eggs in the egg cases of B. germanica and other species of cockroach (Cook Islands
Biodiversity Database 2016). The recent study of Yuan Pan and Zhang (2020) highlighted the new
directions of B. germanica control using Wolbachia or paratransgenes and the use of fungal

insecticides with synergistic agents to enhance insecticidal efficacy.

Chemical controt

The judicious use of chemicals for the control of German cockroach can be a successful
component of cockroach management. Table | lists a number of these insecticides and the
percentage of active ingredients based on WHO (2006). In the Philippines, the Food and Drug
Administration regularly publishes in its website the insecticidal products for cockroach control

(Table 2).

Currently, there are many cockroach insecticides sold in the form of liquid spray,
insecticidal dust, aerosol, smoke, baits, and traps. The information below helps us to understand
some advantages in using different pesticide formulations:

Residual sprays. Residual sprays are usually applied using hand-held compression air
sprayers. The insecticide can also be applied with a paint brush when other equipment is not
available. The commonly used insecticides are the organophosphates, carbamates, synthetic
pyrethroids and more recently insect growth regulators. Ameen et al. (2000) reported that residual
sprays of chlorfenapyr provided 80% reductions in infested apartment at eight weeks post-
treatment.

Dusts. Dry powder formulations are made by mixing insecticide powder with talcum or
another inert carrier powder. They are useful in treating hollow walls, false ceilings and other

cockroach hiding places which cannot be easily reached. It is applied using hand-operated puff-

duster or a plunger-type duster. Boric acid, silica aerogel and diatomaceous earth can provide

control against B. germanica (Jacobs 2013).

Aerosols. Aerosols are fine sprays of very small (0.1-0.50 1m) droplets of insecticide. They
are not suitable for residual treatment, but they can be used for space spraying because droplets
remain in air for some time killing insects by contact. Aerosol usually contains pyrethrins,
pyrethroids or another irritant to drive cockroaches out of their hiding places. It causes quick
reduction in cockroach numbers but no longer lasting control. The use of insect growth regulators

(IGRs) in total release aerosol has been of interest due to its low mammalian toxicity. However,

because of their modest efficacy against cockroaches, they have never gained acceptance. In a

16

study of Ameen et al, (2005), noviflumuron sprays applied in infested apartments provided up to
90% reductions of German cockroaches.

Smokes. They are clouds of insecticide particles produced by heat. The particle size (0.001-
0.4m) is smaller than aerosols. Smokes can penetrate deep into hiding places particularly in
basements of building, sewer, and drainage systems. The study on efficacy of smoke-generator
containing pirimiphos-methy| and cypermethrin conducted by Aulicky et al. (2010) resulted to 100
% mortality of B. germanica during first three (3) hours of exposure. Gas chromatography method
confirmed the airborne concentration of active ingredients decreased significantly within 6 to 12
hours after preparation release.

Baits and Traps. Toxic baits are used without trapping device. They consist of a mixture
of attractive food material and an insecticide. Commercially available toxic baits can be in the
form of pellets or paste. In a review by Jacobs (2013), he indicated that the use of baits containing
hydramethylnon, fipronil, sulfluramid, boric acid or abamectin is a successful method of chemical
control. Also, in the study conducted by Verdeprado (2008), male and female German cockroaches
preferred the regular food over bait stations containing indoxacarb as they tend to approach it first.
They also had frequent visits to the regular diet compared to bait. However, once they approach
the baited diet, they tend to stay fora longer period. In a follow-up study, Jarilla (2010) emphasized
that to ensure the success of baiting program in controlling B. germanica, elimination of all
alternative food sources by cleaning the area and covering the leftovers, garbage, and other food
sources before placing the bait formulation is important.

Repellents. \t is the use of different essential oils such as mint oil, spearmint oil and

eucalyptus oil that are known to repel cockroaches. In the study conducted by Tabaru and

7

Mochizuki (2005), they discussed that B. germanica was repelled by ethanol extracts of some
herbs under laboratory conditions. Herbs which showed repellent effects were Anetheum
graveolens (dill), Apium graveolens (celery), Carum carvi (caraway), Cuminum cymimum
(cumin), Coriandrum sativum, (coriander), Cinamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon), Myristica
fragrans (mace) and Capsicum anuum (chili pepper). However, best results are obtained with the
synthetic products that are easier to standardize such as dilutions of DEET (N, N-diethyl-3-
toluamide) or DMP (dimethyl phthalate). This was proven by the study of Schultz et al. (2006)
and reported that solutions with elemol and DEET exhibited greater significance in contact

repellency compared to catnip essential oil.

Urban Pest Control

Global Urban Pest Control

Global pest control is a growing industry at a rapid rate and was valued at USD 20.6 billion
in 2019. Bilagi et al. (2021) forecast that the global pest control market is expected to reach USD
30.0 billion by 2027.The key driving force influencing growth include the rise of urban
developments, growing consumer awareness concerning health and other hygiene issues, changes
in weather patterns, increasing demand for “green” and environment-friendly technology and a
general rise in the intolerance for pests. There is an increasing number of customers relying on do-
it-yourself techniques or the non-professional individuals in handling pest problems. However.
professional pest control operators (PCOs) are predicted to continue to grow over the next several

decades due to the need for experts who can handle pest populations quickly, effectively, and

18

humanely before things get out of hand. Pest control market based on place of application is
classified into commercial, residential, agriculture, industrial and others. Among all, the
commercial segment has the largest share in 2019 due to necessity in preventing pest infestation

to protect the health of employees and customers in commercial buildings (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Global pest control market based on application (Bilagi et al. 2021).

Moreover, the global urban pest control market is driven by rising insurance-based pest
control services, growing hospitality, pharmaceutical and food processing industries, and
complexity of pest control procedures and safety protocols for chemicals used in pest control. Pest
control market based on type is classified into chemical, mechanical, biological, and others. The
chemical segment has the highest revenue generated in 2019 and expected even until 2027. This
is because of its cost-effectiveness and practical use. Thus, the demand for chemicals is high

compared to biological, mechanical, and other methods (Figure 3).

Philippine Urban Pest Control
Philippines is one of the fastest growing urban pest control market next to Thailand and
Malaysia in Southeast Asia. There is no latest survey or consolidated data available in the

Phil

pines for an estimate value of the present business. However, looking from various

agrochemical industry suppliers, it could be estimated that annual market size is around 5 to 8
million US Dollars. The client comprises pest control operators, private institutions, and local
government units (LGU). Table 3 shows the USD 2.0 million estimated value of annual business

for chemical manufacturers in the Philippines (Dhang 2012).

Rodenticide USD 500,000

Total USD 2.25 million

Table 4 shows the usage pattern of various categories of urban pesticides. Chlorpyrifos and
DDVP are the two active ingredients most used by pest control operators. Both chemicals are the
cheapest in the market compared to synthetic pyrethroids. Meanwhile, termite baits and insect

baits are both becoming popular with 15% and 5% annual growth respectively.

In 1997, Mr. Bailey Yu, then President of Pest Control Association of the Philippines
(PCAP), reported that the existing two hundred PCO companies at that time had estimated gross
sales turnover of Php | billion. It came from the following breakdown: fumigation service 35%,

structural pest control (SPC) 30%, and general pest control (GPC) 35%. Cockroaches ranked as

a

the most important pest concern in GPC while estimated market was at Php 220 million and Php

235 million in 1996 and 1997 respectively (Faylona 1998),

The use of chemical pesticides by the pest control industry is regulated by various state and
federal authorities and must adhere to environmental laws. Pesticides should always be used in a
lawful manner. consistent with the product’s label. Consequently, relevant authority should be
consulted to determine which products are legally allowed in one country when considering
chemical control. The agency regulating the approval of household and urban pesticides in the
Philippines is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA-registered chemicals are the only
pesticides that should be used by the individual non-professional homeowners or hired PCOs in
the control of German cockroach and other urban pests. There is a perception that the stringent

regulations of FDA hamper the registration of generic and generally cheaper pesticides.

Specific Approaches of Professional Pest Control Operators
against German Cockroach

Cockroach control program is the “bread and butter” service offered by professional pest
control operators as part of general pest control (GPC) service line. The target markets of the local
PCOs are the commercial and industrial establishments like shopping malls, offices, food chains
and outlets, drug factories, restaurants, ships, hotels, and banks along with class A and B residential
subdivisions, condominiums, and villages. Prior to cockroach treatment, the professional PCO and
the prospect client must agree with the written proposal submitted by the exterminator. This

proposal includes the scope of work and the methods to be done, the cost of treatment, and the

22

terms of payment (Robin Pest Control, personal communication 2021). Once agreed, the local

PCO may conduct the following operations:

Cockroach inspection

The first part of a successful cockroach control program is the inspection. It is necessary
to identify the pest species in the area (German cockroach or American cockroach), their breeding
sites and the degree of infestation. When looking for cockroaches, all senses must be used. If it is
difficult to locate the German cockroaches, sense of smell can be used due to their distinctive odor
caused by the presence of their feces and pheromones. Inspections should focus on pest-vulnerable
area where food and water are present. The use of flashlights and mirrors are helpful to see German
cockroaches in difficult to reach areas. Unsealed openings such as loose pipes, sinks and cabinets,
wall-mounted electrical panels, mirrors, light fixtures, fire alarms or emergency lighting, and
hollow-legged tables and chairs must be inspected. Equipment where heat is generated: behind
refrigerators and freezers, ovens, stoves, and electrical junction boxes should also be examined.
Cockroach observed during daytime maybe an indication of extremely large population. Table 3
shows the common harborage of German cockroaches as lifted from National Pest Management

Association (2019).

Treatment selection

After a thorough inspection and familiarization of the job site, the different control

methods available for use must be reviewed (e.g., biological control, mechanical control, cultural

control, chemical control) and will be determined which one would be the most applicable.

Usually, integrated control procedures have a better effect than a single control procedure. It is

24

best to combine the sanitation program with some forms of mechanical control plus chemical
control procedures.

The sanitation and cleanliness of the area is primarily responsibility of the client prior to
the pest control treatment. The collaboration between the pest control operators and the staff of
establishment is essential for the successful cockroach control program. Cockroach control should
include better storage of leftover food and proper collection and disposal of garbage to reduce
amount of trash and garbage (Cariaso 2003). Food, water, and harborage must be eliminated to
increase pest control success. Cleanliness and sanitation are requisites for a preventive action in
cockroach control program.

Meanwhile, determining the entry point or the source of pest is an important corrective
action during the control program done by professional exterminator. Mechanical alteration such
as sealing of cracks around wall-mounted electrical panels, light fixtures, bulletin boards, sinks
and cabinets while repairing of door gaskets, or self-closing doors are necessary. The use of
vacuum cleaners to remove heavy infestation provides immediate control and instant customer
satisfaction. It also reduces the infestation into a manageable level.

In the use of pesticides in managing German cockroaches, products shall be appropriately
evaluated for the intended use and site. These pesticides may be residual, non-residual, in bait
formulation or an insect growth regulator (IGR). In an area heavily infested with German
cockroaches, the initial treatment is called a “clean-up treatment”. Spraying is done thoroughly to
significantly reduce the cockroach infestation. It is necessary for regular and continuing follow-up
treatments after the initial clean up. Residual chemicals are used for cockroach control due to its

killing action which continues for about week thereby causing death of newly hatched nymphs.

25

Knockdown insecticides on the other hand works by irritating the cockroach and flushing them
out from their hiding places. German cockroaches targeted by knockdown insecticides run wildly
until killing effect of chemical causes death in about 5-10 minutes (Catan and Catan 1980).

According to some PCOs, it is prescribed to use the combination of both residual and knockdown

insecticides for clean-up and follow-up preventive treatments. In areas where spraying is not
possible due to possible contamination of food or food utensils such as restaurants and food outlet,

the preferred chemical method are insecticide baits and IGRs. Cockroach bait formulations can be

gels, liquid or dry-flowable. The baits are placed where the cockroaches have been observed to be
active during the night. German cockroaches will be attracted to the bait and will die several hours
afier ingestion. It is advised to keep bait stored separately from other chemical products that might
contaminate it resulting its unpalatability to B. germanica, Consequently, the IGRs mode of action
is to prevent the normal development of immature cockroaches so they cannot reproduce as adults.
Also, IGRs cause the ootheca to release prematurely (Oi et al. 2017). In warehouse or non-food.
storage area, dusting may be utilized for cockroach control. In this method, insecticide powder can
be blown into spaces with hand-operated puff-duster or a plunger-type duster (Jacobs 2013). Extra
caution must be observed during application though since dusts easily floats in the air and may

contaminate non-target areas.

Monitoring
Cockroach control is an ongoing process. The constant monitoring of the facility for the

pest activity would be a great help to hired PCOs of one establishment. However, the pest control

professionals most likely visit the facility on weekly or bi-weekly basis. Thus, the staff of the

26

establishment needs to report any signs of pest activity. Another monitoring device which can be
used are the sticky traps. They can be the “eyes” of hired PCOs in the property and are working
for 24/7.They are placed in dry areas along structural lines, adjacent to walls, and comer where
cockroaches travel and close to suspected cockroach harborages. Monitors can give sufficient
information to the professional pest control operators such as the presence of all life stages of
German cockroaches indicates that they are dealing with an established infestation, while one to a
few adults indicates that PCO is dealing with a new introduction (Oi et al. 2017). Moreover,
monitors may suggest of which direction the cockroach came from to better focus the routine

inspections.

Documentation

Reporting and documentation may be required as part of agreement between the hired
PCOs and the client (personal communication). Important documents include a scope of service,
pest activity reports, service reports, corrective action reports, trap layout maps, lists of approved
pesticides, pesticide usage reports and applicator licenses. In the documentation, it should also
include notes when corrective actions were implanted to determine which steps have been
successful and should be integrated into part of cockroach control program. Up-to-date pest control
documentation benefits the two parties either the PCOs or the client. For the client, it is a good
sign to an auditor that the facility is taking pest control seriously. While for the hired PCOs, it can
be used by the client as basis for the renewal of the contract since it can serve as tool to offer as

part ofa quarterly or annual review prior to any scope of alteration (NPMA 2019).

27

A successful control program against the German cockroach has the four specific
approaches mentioned above. Nevertheless, control failure is also possible if factors such as the
close association of German cockroaches with people and food, their rapid reproduction, and their
tendency to gather in inaccessible places are not taken into consideration. Control failure can also
result if German cockroach has developed resistance. Scharf and Rollins (2020) discussed that B.
germanica are becoming more difficult to eliminate as they developed cross-resistance to the pest

management industry's insecticides in urban areas.

In the Philippines, the history of insecticide resistance of German cockroach was not well
documented. In fact, there is no published data on insecticide resistance of German cockroach to
any novel and conventional insecticides. The only available literature is on chemical control of
German cockroach by Mendoza (1976), Verdeprado (2008) and Jarilla (2010). Because of this
dearth of information on cockroach resistance, many PCOs nowadays face this serious problem
due to ineffective control against B. germanica in different establishments such as malls,
supermarkets, restaurants, and bakeries. This problem results to negative effect to local PCO
industry due to frequent complaints, “call-backs” and the worst case are the cancelled contracts.
Gonzalez (1981) gave this challenge to those in academe and research to undertake studies in
biology and control of pests found in urban areas which would be a big help for the pest control

industry and the general public.

28

ide Resistance

IRAC (2019) defined insecticide resistance as the heritable change in the sensitivity of a
pest population which is reflected in the repeated failure of a product to achieve the expected level
of control when used according to the label recommendation for that pest species. It arises because
of artificial selection of insect populations with an insecticide. As a result of continued application
over time, some naturally occurring traits that confer resistance are favored and thereby selected.
Thus, the surviving insect population becomes increasingly difficult to control at the recommended
rate and application interval, as individuals with these traits selectively thrive and proliferate.
Insecticide resistance is an increasing problem faced by those who use insecticide for the control

of medical, veterinary, and agricultural insect pests. On the contrary susceptibility is defined as the

state of being likely to be harmed by exposure to a particular thing, in this case, exposure of test
insects to an insecticide. Susceptible organisms are those who were killed after insecticidal

exposure while tolerant individuals are who survived. The decreased susceptibility of a pest

population to an insecticide that was previously effective at controlling the pestis called insecticide
resistance (Heong et al. 2013).

Resistance can lead to increased application rates, frequency of pesticide-use and ultimate
loss of efficacy (Scott et al. 2000). Infinite supply of novel insecticides to replace current
insecticide cannot be assumed due to the increased difficulty in discovering new compounds, high
cost of product development and the loss of currently available materials because of the stricter
policy of the government institution regulating the pesticides (Georghiou 1986; Hammock and

Soderlund 1986). Operational factors in insecticide resistance are those related to application of

les. These factors include the chemical nature of pesticides, the relationship of previously

29

used chemicals, the persistence of residues and formulations, the application and selection
threshold, the life stage selected, the mode of application, space limiting selection and, the
alternation selection (Georghiou and Taylor 1977). Operational factors are under man’s control

and their manipulation may help to delay insecticide resistance

Insecticide Resistance Mechanisms

Yu (2008) explained that there are four possible types of resistance mechanisms to main
insecticide groups in all insecticides to date. These are reduced penetration, target site insensitivity,
metabolic resistance (simplified as physiological resistance) and behavioral resistance.
Explanation of each type follows:

Reduced penetration. \t is the situation in which toxins are incapable to penetrate the
cuticle of insects. This can be explained by the binding protein or lipid reservoir that traps the
insecticide in the cuticle; the degrading enzyme located in cuticle: and the high lipid & protein
content which become impermeable cuticle.

Target insensitivity. \t is mutation-based resistance mechanism and results to alteration of
target sites. It occurs when the previously binding site protein is altered in the structure or
conformation which leads to failure of the toxicant to bind to the target (Brooks 1976).

Metabolic Resistance. tis the ability of the insect to increase detoxification of insecticides.

This can be explained by three processes such as gene amplification, gene over-expression and

increased enzyme activity. Gene amplification is the production of greater number of genes for
resistance. Resistance via gene over-expression is when one gene can transcribe greater number
while increased enzyme activity occurs when a detoxifying enzyme performs faster than the

normal one. Examples of detoxifying enzymes that have been shown to be involved in insecticide

30

resistance are the cytochrome monooxygenases (CYP), hydrolases and esterases and the
conjugating enzymes.

In the control of German cockroach, provided that insecticides are an integral part of pest
control programs, the potential for development of physiological resistance will be significant
(Rust 2001). Strategies to rotate the use of different insecticides have often recommended
counteracting this type of resistance.

Behavioral resistance. \t is the development of ability of the insect to avoid a dose that
would be lethal. It is stimulus-dependent and can be classified as hypersensitivity or hyper-
irritability. Insect’s response once they have this mechanism is to move away from the affected
area, avoidance of initially a phagostimulant or autotomy (the casting off a part of the body by an
animal under threat), Aside from studies showing the existence of physiological resistance in
German cockroach, there have been few examples of behavioral resistance. The study of Silverman
and Bieman (1993) reported one strain of B. germanica was observed to have aversion to feeding
on glucose in diet and did not consume toxic bait containing glucose. Moreover, strains collected
from Republic of Korea and USA showed glucose aversion (Silverman and Ross 1994). These
reports suggest that rotation of baits with different active ingredient will not be enough to prevent
reduced performances of the toxicants. Also, monitoring of food preference and necessary changes
should be evaluated to prevent avoidance. These scenarios are extremely important and should be
considered in German cockroach control.

The most important principle for resistance measurement is the dosage-montalily response.
When the dose increases, the mortality of the tested population also increases. With some

mathematical transformation (e.g., mortality to probits and dosage to logarithm), it is possible to

31

get a straight-line relating dosage and mortality. This line can help in estimating the dose expected
to kill a certain proportion of the insect population. Commonly used levels are LDso, LDso and
LDss (Cochran 1995). According to Yu (2008), LDsois a more sensitive index of toxicity than any
other concentrations and is used as standard for comparing the relative toxicity of insecticides due
to following reasons. First, LDso has narrower 95% confidence interval than other LD values.

Added to this, according to normal distribution for the logarithms of tolerance concentration

(Finney 1972), there are more individuals that respond at LDo levels (and is at maximal) compared

with indivi

luals with high tolerance or low tolerance. Lastly, the sigmoid curve is steepest in the
region of 50% response so that small change in concentration in this region of the curve causes
large change in percent mortality. Thus, LDso is more sensitive index of toxicity than any other
dose. The LDso is commonly expressed as milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). However, there are
instances that exact dose initially administered to test insect cannot be determined thus, LCso is
alternatively used. LCso is the concentration of the insecticide in the external media which can kill
50% of the test population. The 95% confidence interval (upper and lower limits) on LCso are
parameters to indicate whether the difference of toxicities of certain insecticide to a test population
is significant if no overlapping is observed.

The slope of log dose-probit straight line provides a useful information as well. Slope value
is related to the variance of the population. If line is steep having high slope (b>2), population is

relatively homogeneous while a flat line or shallow slope (b<I) indicates a heterogeneous

population showing a large variance in response to the insecticide (Yu 2008).
Although German cockroaches have been reported to have developed resistance against

many groups of insecticides, it does not mean that all German cockroach populations are resistant

32

to all insecticides. Some populations of B. germanica that are resistant to some insecticides may
be susceptible to other types of insecticides (Cochran 1995). The current challenge to
entomologists and to pest control industry is to propose management strategies to delay or prevent
the development of insecticide resistance in German cockroaches. Effective tactics can best be
proposed when a complete field monitoring and status of its susceptibility to currently used

insecticides are achieved.

Bioassay Technique

In the monitoring of insecticide resistance and bio-efficacy of different insecticides, the
choice of the bioassay is essential. To date, a wide range of bioassay and biochemical tests are
available, but results may not be comparable since different tests measure dissimilar parameters
thus, leading to complicated analysis of monitoring data (IRAC 2019). In detecting insecticide
resistance in the German cockroach, there are two commonly used types of tests: the topical
application test and the jar test. Topical application had been used to monitor resistance in
numerous insect species (Ffrech-Constant and Roush 1991), whereas the jar test (Keller et al.
1956) was specifically developed for the use with the German cockroach. Several researchers

studied these two methods in tests with numerous insecticides such as propoxur, diazinon,

chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, bendiocarb, chlorpyrifos, fenithrothion, and pyreth

s and concluded
that jar tests are more reliable than topical applications since they rely on tarsal contact with

insecticide deposits (Scharf et al. 1995). The WHO jar test is a standard method in measuring the

susceptibility levels of a German cockroach population to a given insecticide. This technique is

33

designed to investigate the emergence of an insecticide-resistant strain and devised to detect
physiological resistance in cockroaches. The method employs treating glass jar with insecticide
solutions diluted in analytical grade acetone. The treated jars will be rolled horizontally allowing
solutions to run evenly over the bottom and side until the acetone evaporates. Afterwards, the adult
German cockroaches will be bio-assayed on the treated glass jars for | hour and then transferred
to holding container. The results of mortality will be recorded after 24 hours (WHO 1970).

In various studies, researchers have paid attention on using the adult male as test insect
because of its uniform size and weight. On the other hand, Koehler et al. (1993) reported that late-
stage nymphs of B. germanica were significantly more tolerant to bendiocarb, cypermethrin, and
chlorpyrifos than adult males. Valles et al. (1994) obtained same results on some pyrethroids. Qian
et al. (2010), also discussed that late instar B. germanica (six-week-old nymphs) were more
difficult to kill than adult males and females with dichlorvos and propoxur. The author used the
late instar of Blattella germanica (six-week-old nymphs) in the current study after rearing in the
laboratory to ensure same age range during the bioassay procedure.

In light of the above literatures, the present study was undertaken to shorten the gap in the
unavailability of published data on the current status of susceptibility of German cockroach to
commercial insecticides in the Philippines. Results obtained from this study can improve on
decision making in urban pest control industry in considering an appropriate insecticide for

effective control of German cockroach.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Figure 4 shows the schematic diagram of the methods used in the current study. The
cockroaches were collected from nine sites, three sites from each of the three towns in Laguna.
The collected gravid female German cockroaches were brought to laboratory and mass reared at
temperature 28 °C and relative humidity of 58 £2% to ensure enough samples of six-week-old
nymphs during the bioassay procedure. Afterwards, five commercial insecticides were prepared
which served as representatives of five insecticide group (organophosphates, carbamates,
pyrethroids, phenyl pyrazole and neonicotinoids). When all materials were ready, the bioassay
procedures were conducted. Prior to final bioassay, preliminary dose-fixing experiment was useful
step in the selection of the test dosages to be applied in the final bioassay. At least five to six
concentrations were used in the final bioassay using the WHO glass jar method. The final step was
the data analysis using the POLO plus version 2.0 software program to conduct probit analysis.

The detailed description of each step presented were described in the following subsections.

Mass Rearing of Test Nymphs

The collected German cockroaches were brought to the Toxicology Laboratory, Institute
of Weed Science, Entomology and Plant Pathology. College of Agriculture and Food Science,
University of the Philippines Los Bafios and reared in the laboratory with temperature of 28°C+2
and relative humidity of 58 +2%. Gravid females from each collection site were transferred to
cylindrical plastic jar with petroleum jelly at the top and covered with ladies’ stocking to prevent
the escape of the cockroaches (Fig. 10). The rest of the collected cockroaches were killed and
disposed of properly. The gravid females were provided with water and dog pellets and monitored
daily for egg laying and egg hatching. Once first day old nymphs were observed, the remaining
gravid females were transferred to a new cylindrical plastic jar while those without oothecae were
killed. This was done daily. Nymphs were provided with dog pellets and water soaked in cotton.
The jars were checked daily for signs of feed deterioration, excessive moisture, and mold

accumulation. Six-week-old nymphs were used for the bioassay tests.

Five formulated insecticides (Figure 12) from five insecticide groups. namely:
organophosphates, carbamates. synthetic pyrethroids, phenyl pyrazoles, and neonicotinoids were
used in this study. One representative chemical from each insecticide groups was selected:
Dichloroviny! Dimethy! Phosphate (DDVP) from organophosphates. propoxur from carbamates.
a-cypermethrin from synthetic pyrethroids. fipronil from pheny! pyrazole and thiamethoxam from

neonicotinoids. All compounds were purchased from the suppliers. Table 4 shows the list of

insecticides that were used in the bioassay tests.

Treatment of Glass Jars for Residual Bioassay Test

Glass jars with a volume of 325 mL, height of 14 cm, and diameter of 5 cm were used
for the tests (Figure 14A). The insecticide solution was dispensed into individual glass jars using
a disposable syringe to deliver 2 mL solution. Immediately after treatment, the glass jars were
rolled horizontally on a flat surface and then on a non-heating hotdog roller (Figure 14B) so that
solution ran evenly over the bottom and sides until the solvents had evaporated completely. The
upper inside lid of the jars was smeared with a thin layer of petroleum jelly and enclosed with

mesh cloth to prevent the cockroach escape (WHO 1970: Scharf et al. 1995).

Nymphal Bioassay

The bioassay was performed within the framework of WHO (1970) and Scharf et al.

(1995) techniques. with slight modifications. From the nymphal rearing jars. healthy and active

individuals were chosen while lethargic and abnormal individuals were discarded. The nymphs
were transferred first into a holding container for one hour to verify ifthey were healthy and active

individuals.

Batches of ten (10) six-week-old nymphs were transferred to treated glass jars with extra
care. The unhealthy or damaged nymphs were removed and replaced. Exposure time of contact
was one (|) hour. Afterwards, the cockroaches were transferred to clean holding containers (Figure

15) provided with ample food and water. The number of dead/moribund insects was recorded after

45

24 hours. A cockroach was considered dead if it was unable to turn back to its normal posture by
itself within 2 min after being touched on the abdomen with a pair of forceps (Scharf et al. 1995).
When the control mortality exceeded 10%, the test was considered unacceptable. Each treatment
including the control used four (4) jars containing ten (10) cockroaches in each concentration. A

total of three (3) preliminary trials were conducted for each population.

Figure 15. Holding container showing the front and upper portion.

Set-up for Final Bioassay

After determining the range of mortality of nymphs from preliminary bioassay. the final
concentrations (at least 5-6 concentrations) yielding 5% - 95% mortality in 24h were used. In each
dose/concentration, 40 insects were used per insecticide treatment. For ease of handling and to
save on space, ten (10) cockroaches were put in each of the four (4) jars to complete the 40 insects
per concentration. There were five (5) batches of final bioassay trials for each population. ‘The

batch trials were done per population testing the five-insecticide treatment. These five trial

46

bioassays were done to randomize effects related to laboratory procedure. After 24h observation,

insects (dead or alive) used from the final bioassay test were discarded.

Data Analysis of Final Bioassay

Mortality data from all five trials in the final bioassay in each German cockroach
populations were used for analysis. LCso values were calculated from log dosage-probit mortality
regression line using POLO plus version 2.0 software program. The program automatically
computes the corrected mortality. Standard deviation or confidence intervals of the means of LCso

values, and slopes were also determined.

In this study, each population of B. germanica from nine collection sites were bio-assayed
to five commercial insecticides and were analyzed independently. Purposive sampling was done
on three collection sites on each town where the abundance of Blattella germanica was observed
to ensure sufficient samples were used until the end of the study. Due to sampling method used
(which is non-probability), samples taken from each collection sites cannot represent the whole

population of main collection sites from Los Bafios, Calamba, and Bay. Furthermore, due to

limitation of time and labor force, the author performed bioassay method by batch on each German
cockroach population as well as the data analysis.

Aside from the bioassay results on each population done in laboratory, the owners or staff
securing the collection sites were interviewed regarding to cockroach control methods employed

during the collection period. Moreover, chemical insecticides previously used for cockroach

control as well as the manner and frequency of application were asked.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

This chapter is divided into two (2) parts. Part | presented the description of each collection
site within the geographical framework of each of the three main collection sites namely: Town of,
Los Bafios, City of Calamba and Town of Bay. Each collection site was at least about 1.5-2. km
away from another collection site to avoid population migration which can affect the gene
frequency of German cockroach. The susceptibility status of six-week-old B. germanica from nine
populations when tested in five commercial insecticides was presented in Part II. Susceptibility is
defined as the state of being likely to be harmed by exposure to a particular thing, in this case,
exposure of test insects to an insecticide. Susceptible organisms are those who were killed after
insecticidal exposure while those survived are tolerant individuals. On the other hand, the
decreased susceptibility of a pest population to an insecticide that was previously effective at

controlling the pest is called insecticide resistance (Heong et al. 2013). Determination of

insecticide resistance is done by comparing the susceptibility of field population to a confirmed
susceptible strain (a population which was known not exposed to any insecticide for a certain
number of generations). In this study, the focus was on determination of toxicity of five

insecticides used and not on insecticide resistance due to lack of susceptible strain of German

cockroach. LCs was the parameter utilized to compare the relative toxicity of five insect

ides

while the 95% confidence interval on LCso indicates whether the

ifference of toxicities of certain
insecticide to a test population is significant if no overlapping is observed. The higher the LCso

value, the lower the toxicity while the lower the LC5o value, the higher the toxicity.

Geographical Analysis

Table 7 presents the location source of the nine test populations of B. germanica used in
bioassay tests. The chemical insecticides used by the owner or personnel assigned in the collection
sites are also listed in Table 7. The geographical descriptions below present a clear picture of the

location of each site in relation to the rest of the sites.

Los Bafios. The municipality is located at 14°10°N 121 °13°E. Elevation at these coordinates is
estimated at 118 meters or 387 feet above sea level. Its land area is about 54, 22 km?, It has a
tropical wet climate which has monthly mean temperatures above 18°C in every month of the year
(Mcknight and Hess 2000). It is classified as an urban area (NSO 2006). The three (3) collection
sites were restaurant kitchen with a population code LBK: a meat shop with a population code
LBM and a vegetable store with a population code LBV. The distance of the collection sites from
each other is ca. 2.5 km, The town of Los Bafios is bounded at northwest by City of Calamba (7.22

Kilometers) while on the east by the town of Bay (6.32 kilometers).

Calamba. The city is situated at 14.1877° N, 121.1251° E. It has a land area of 149.5 km? with
elevation estimated at 98 meters or 322 feet above sea level. It has a tropical monsoon climate with
a short dry season (which lasts only from January to April) and a longer rainy season. The city of
Calamba belongs to first city income class of the province of Laguna. Due to highly urbanized
location and increase in population (PSA 2020), many restaurants, markets, and meat shops are

widespread to fulfill the demand of the society. The collection sites in this town were two (2) meat

49

shops with population code CALMI and CALM2 respectively, while CALC is a coconut grater

shop. The distance of the collection sites was ca. 1.5-2.5 km away from each other.

Bay. The town is located at 14.1320° N, 121.2569° E. Elevation at these coordinates is estimated
at 17 m (56 ft) above sea level. This town belongs to a 2™ class municipality in the province of
Laguna and has a land area of 42.66 km?. The town of Bay has tropical wet climate with a short
dry season (from January to May) and a longer rainy season. The average precipitation in a year
is 108 mm. The three collection sites were a meat shop with population code BAYM, a sari-sari
store with population code of BAYS, and a small food stall kitchen (BAYK). The collection sites
were ca. 1.5-3.5 km away from each other.

The establishment of population of Blattella germanica depends on the availability of food,
water, and harborage (Valles 1996). This is supported by the study of Tanaka and Motoki (1993)
that heating and food supply influence the distribution and population of B. germanica. Therefore,
one population of B. germanica will not simply migrate to form another colony or population if
there is enough source of food in the current habitat. This scenario was considered in the selection
of sites for collection of the cockroach populations since population mobility is a very important
behavioral factor for resistance development (Yu 2008). When susceptible insects migrate to
another population, the influx of migrants dilute the frequency of resistance among survivor after
insecticide treatments. However, Barcay and Bennett (1991) discussed that starvation increases
the distance travelled, velocity and the proportion of time in motion of adult males and final instars
but not adult females. In the current study, average distance of each collection site from another

collection site is 1.5 to 2.0 kilometers to avoid the cross-mating of the different populations. Only

50

the adult gravid females were collected which proved to be less mobile than adult males and final

instars. Further, gravid females are not affected by the starvation or lack of food supply and
remain in the respective harborage. In the current study, collection sites are food plenty such as
restaurant kitchen, meat shops, vegetable stores and kitchen food stall, therefore no movement of
German cockroach from one collection site to another. Only accidental transport which can be by
humans, animals, or shipment of baggage might be a possible reason for migration of the German
cockroach from one population to another.

Sanitation is the first step in effective German cockroach control program. The removal of
food sources and water reduce the population of German cockroach and lessen the risk of
encouraging new infestations. Failure to maintain the cleanliness might lead to the increase of
German cockroach population in an area. This primary control strategy should be done before
doing any insecticide applications (Ogg et al. 2006). However, some individuals skip this
necessary step to see dramatic effect on German cockroach control. This condition was evident
and observed by the author on some collection sites selected in this study. Owner or staff of
selected establishments apply commercial insecticides whenever German cockroaches are noticed
even without eliminating the resources needed by cockroaches such a water, food, and shelter.

Thus, frequent application of chemicals is practiced which might be a possible reason on the

susceptibility status of nine populations of B. germanica and discussed in the next section.

Suscepti

of the Different German Cockroach Populations

Los Bafios Town
The results of bioassays of five commercial insecticides against the six-week-old nymphs
of Blatiella germanica collected from the three sites are discussed below.

LBK population (Site 1). The insecticidal potency of five commercial insecticides at 24
hours after treatment (HAT) is shown in Table 8. Among five insecticides, fipronil was the most
toxic having the lowest LCso value (LCso=22.59 ppm) while DDVP was the least toxic having the
highest LCso value (LCs0=2,568.28 ppm). Based on overlapping confidence interval at 95%, the
toxicity of propoxur and thiamethoxam are the same. Hence, the decreasing toxicity was fipronil
> thiamethoxam = propoxur > a-cypermethrin > DDVP.

Slopes generated based on concentration-mortality responses varied from 1.001 to 4.93.
The response of B. germanica to DDVP had the steepest slope (4.93) while response to fipronil
had the flattest slope (1.001) as illustrated in Figure 16. This shows that response of the LBK
population is more homogeneous to DDVP (the least effective insecticide) but less homogeneous
to fipronil (the most effective insecticide). It appears that the LBK population has shown tolerance
to DDVP and possibly starting to develop resistance to it. According to Brown and Pal (1971), the
frequency of resistant genotypes increases in populations under insecticide pressure. With this
information, PCOs can decide to minimize the use of DDVP or other insecticides in the
organophosphate group.

The source of the LBK population is a restaurant kitchen (Table 7) which only implements
in-house control of the German cockroach. Based on observation and personal interview, the

restaurant staff monitor the cockroach infestation using bait trap. This product contains a food

53

attractant which lures the German cockroach, which then gets stuck in the adhesive within. The
commercial roach trap is effective in monitoring as well as in reduction of the cockroach
population. Once the infestation level became unmanageable, the restaurant staff resort to using
aerosol formulation available from the nearby hardware or supermarket. The formulation contains
a mixture of imiprothrin 0.10% and cyphenothrin 0.10% from the class of synthetic pyrethroids.
Rahayu et al. (2016) reported that commercial aerosol insecticides containing pyrethroids cause
low to very high level of resistance to German cockroaches in Indonesia. In the current study, a-
cypermethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid was less toxic against the LBK population compared to

fipronil or thiamethoxam.

LBM population (Site 2). Based on LCso values, the general trend of toxicity of five
insecticides against the LBM population was thiamethoxam > propoxur = fipronil > a -
cypermethrin > DDVP (Table 9). Thiamethoxam was the most toxic compound with the lowest
LCso value (LCso = 38.36 ppm) while DDVP was the least toxic with the highest LCso value
(LCs0=2,120.39 ppm). Meanwhile, propoxur and fipronil are equally toxic to the LBM population.

The slope values of the log-probit lines for the five insecticides ranged from 1.29 to 3.78

(Figure 17). These responses are i

ication that LBM population has less heterogeneity to the
selection pressure provided by the five commercial toxicants. This shows that response of B.
germanica from the LBM population is most homogeneous to a-cypermethrin (3.78) and DDVP
(3.55) and least homogeneous to propoxur (1.29). The small variance in slope shown by the
homogeneous response to a-cypermethrin and DDVP by LBM indicates possible chance of the

presence of resistance gene developing in the population thus decreasing genetic variation

Sa

(Rosenheim & Hoy 1986). The decrease in genetic variation might be due to continued selection
pressure which in this case - frequent application of synthetic pyrethroids, thus eliminating
susceptible individuals and artificially selecting individuals with resistant genes. With this
information, PCOs can be informed to altemate their choice of chemicals from synthetic pyrethroid
class into other groups to slow down the rate of insecticide resistance.

The collection site (LBM) is a meat shop located at the Los Bafios public market (Table 7).
Based on interview, the market administrator assigns an in-house group to treat the area with
synthetic pyrethroid (permethrin 10%) through misting and spot spraying. Since a-cypermethrin
is related to the currently used chemical (permethrin) with respect to mode of action, it would be
prudent to shift to another class of insecticide except organophophates. Pyrethroids are neurotoxins
acting on the production of action potential. As sodium channel modulators, they slow the closing
and inactivation of the channel causing it to remain longer than normal mode. Keeping sodium
channel open re-excite the same area of membrane resulting to repetitive firing and hyperexcitation
in targeted insect (IRAC 2019). Nerve axons occur throughout the insect’s body, when pyrethroids
enter the body, the symptoms are extremely fast-acting resulting to immediate “knockdown”

(BASF 2013).

LBV population (Site 3). Thiamethoxam and fipronil are equally toxic to LBV population
having the lowest LCso values (LCso= 30.78 ppm for fipronil and LCsy= 43.59 ppm for
thiamethoxam) while the least toxic compound was DDVP having the highest LCso value
(LCso=1,671.20 ppm). The toxicity of DDVP, a-cypermethrin, and propoxur are different from the

other toxicants based on confidence interval (Table 10).

55

Figure 18 shows the slopes of the concentration—mortality responses of LBV population to
five insecticides. The slope values of fipronil and thiamethoxam were 0.89 and 0.98 respectively
indicating more heterogeneity response of LBV population. The slope values were 3.92 and 4.07
for a-cypermethrin and DDVP respectively indicating more homogeneous response. The
homogeneity response of German cockroaches in the latter insecticides indicates possible
development of tolerance in the insects. Using this information, PCOs and individual pesticide
applicator can be advised to minimize the use of pesticides containing organophosphate and
synthetic pyrethroids in the meantime and instead use the newer fipronil and thiamethoxam if
available.

LBV population was collected from a vegetable store (Table 7). Abundant German
cockroaches was observed every collection trip due to availability of food source such as rotten
coconut husks and coconut meat. Environmental modification is the main cockroach control
method and no hired pest control operator is servicing the establishment (personal
communication). Without insecticide exposure, the LBV population could be a source of a
susceptible strain. According to Syed et al. (2014), resistance does not develop unless and until an
insecticide is applied repeatedly over a certain period of time. However, bioassay results showed
the reduced toxicity of DDVP and possible presence of resistance gene in LBV population as

discussed in homogeneity response.

Calamba City

The results of bioassays of five commercial insecticides against the six-week-old nymphs
of Blattella germanica collected from the three sites are discussed below:

CALMI population (Site 4). The LCso of five commercial insecticides against six-week-
old nymphs of Blattella germanica at 24 hours after treatment is shown in Table 1. The toxicity
of five insecticides has the general trend of thiamethoxam = fipronil = propoxur >a-cypermethrin
> DDVP. Thiamethoxam has the lowest LCso value (LCso= 42.69 ppm) but did not significantly
differ from fipronil and propoxur based on confidence interval. DDVP was the least toxic with the
highest LCso value (LCso= 2,527.28 ppm).

Slope values obtained from probit analysis of five commercial insecticides against German
cockroach ranged from 1.11 to 6.02. This shows that CALMI population of B. germanica are
homogeneous to the selection pressure provided by DDVP and to a lesser extent a-cypermethrin.
Homogeneous population is an indication of small variation of response of German cockroach to
the insecticide. This reflects a possible chance of the presence of resistance gene in which continued
pesticide application can lead to artificial selection of resistant individuals. With this information,
PCOs can be informed to alternate their choice of chemicals belonging from organophosphate and
synthetic pyrethroids to other class such as neonicotinoids.

Collection site 4 is a meat shop in Calamba market (Table 7). The common methods of
cockroach control are sanitation and use of residual spray insecticide containing synthetic
pyrethroid (deltamethrin 2.5%). According to the assigned personnel, the establishment utilizes
non-professional staff assigned by the market administrator and application method is through

misting and spot spraying. Syed et al. (2014) reported that deltamethrin 2.5 SC showed moderate

63

to high level of resistance against adult Periplaneta americana. On the susceptibility status of
German cockroaches in Iran, Mohebbi Nodez et al. (2018) presented that dormitory and hospital
strains of B. germanica were tolerant to lambda cyhalothrin (WP 10%) and cyfluthrin (WP 10%).
In the present study, a-cypermethrin which has the same mode of action with the currently used
insecticide, deltamethrin, exhibited lower effectivity among five commercial insecticides. The
reduced efficacy might be due to the frequency of application resulting to increased selection
pressure on German cockroach from CALMI population. When the selection pressure becomes
more intense, the development of resistance progresses more rapidly. There are at least 10 to 15
generations required for the development of resistance in insect (Yu 2008). German cockroaches
have high reproductive potential, higher number of eggs per ootheca, shorter hatching time and
shorter nymphal stage. Thus, surviving population after series of insecticide application can

produce a colony of resistant German cockroaches.

CALM? population (Site 5). Table 12 shows the contact toxicity of five insecticides
against six-week-old nymphs of Blattella germanica from CALM2 population at 24 hours after
treatment. The general trend of toxicity of five commercial insecticides against B. germanica from
CALM2 was fipronil > thiamethoxam = propoxur >a-cypermethrin > DDVP. Fipronil was the
most toxic with the lowest LCso value (LCso= 7.75 ppm) while DDVP was the least toxic with the

highest LCso value (LCs = 2,238.32 ppm).

For homogeneity response (slope of the log-dose probit relationship), the slope values

ranged from 1.05 (fipronil) to 5.88 (a-cypermethrin) (Figure 20). This shows that response of B.

64

germanica population is most homogeneous to a-cypermethrin and least homogeneous to fipronil.
The homogeneity response of German cockroaches when tested in a-cypermethrin indicates
possible presence of resistance gene in the population which is starting to increase in frequency.
The frequency of resistance gene can be favored if continuous selection pressure (e.g frequent
application of synthetic pyrethroids) is employed. Thus, eliminating susceptible individuals and
artificially selecting individuals with resistant genes. The development of resistance in response to
intensive pesticide pressure is an example of this adaptive continuous evolution (Stockwell et al.
2003). Therefore, it is advised that professional and non-professional pesticide applicator to
alternate their choice of chemicals from synthetic pyrethroid class into other groups.

CALM2 collection site is a meat shop in a small ~talipapa” (Table 7). There is no hired
PCO or in-house pest control operator servicing the establishment. The abundance of B. germanica
population was observed every collection trip due to abundance of food supply for the cockroach
such as carcasses and meat blood. Moreover, poor sanitation in the said establishment was
observed due to accumulated garbage in the nearby area. The meat shop owner is dependent on
the use of commercial insecticide in aerosol formulation containing mixture of tetramethrin 0.5%

and cypermethrin 0.15% to control the cockroach. During the collection, the owner volunteered

that German cockroach was no longer affected by the pesticide application. This information
confirms the result of bioassay tests showing the lower effectivity of a-cypermethrin (second to
DDVP) to the homogeneous tolerant CALM2 population (observed slope of a-cypermethrin 5.88).
This is in accordance with the report of Cochran (1995) that if an insect population has a large

(steep) slope, this population is homogeneous in its response to the insecticide. However, this claim

must be further analyzed in the future studies regarding to the resistance status of the said

65

population using another parameter - the resistance ratio (RR), in comparison to an established

susceptible population as standard.

CALC population (Site 6). The insecticidal potency of five commercial insecticides against
six-week-old nymphs of Blattella germanica from CALC population at 24 hours after treatment is
shown in Table 13. The general trend of the toxicity of five commercial insecticides against B.
germanica is thiamethoxam = fipronil = propoxur > a-cypermethrin> DDVP. Among five
insecticides, thiamethoxam was the most toxic with the lowest LCso value (LCso= 102.16 ppm)
while DDVP was the least toxic with LCso value 2,666.46 ppm. The toxicity of fipronil, propoxur,
and thiamethoxam against B. germanica were not statistically different from each other based on
overlapping of confidence interval while DDVP and a-cypermethrin were significantly different
among the five insecticides. Thus, we can infer that responses of B. germanica to fipronil, propoxur
and thiamethoxam were the same but not with DDVP and a-cypermethrin.

The slope values ranged from 0.80-4.94. Slope of fipronil was less than | indicating high

heterogeneity response of B. germanica to this insecticide whereas the other four insect

les
showed more homogeneity response of B. germanica, with the steepest slope of the regression line
for DDVP as presented in Figure 21. Homogeneous population indicates small variation of
response of German cockroach when tested in DDVP and a-cypermethrin. The small variance
indicates the possible presence of resistance gene which was artificially selected through time and
might eliminated the susceptible individuals (Hoskins and Gordon 2003). On the other hand, large
variation among individual response is reflected in shallower slope of fipronil. With this
information, PCOs and individual pesticide applicator can be guided to minimize the use of

pesticides containing organophosphate and synthetic pyrethroids but rather, use of fipronil is

66

recommended as the most toxic insecticide to a heterogeneous population of the German

cockroach.

CALC collection site is an old coconut grater shop (Table 7). Poor sanitation and moisty
environment observed in the area resulting to large colony of cockroach species (B. germanica and
Periplaneta americana) during collection trips. No hired pest control operator servicing the said

establishment while do-it-yourself technique is currently done to control the German cockroach

population. The use of chemical is mi

of Blattella germanica were described below.

insecticides against six-week-old nymphs of Blattella germanica from BAYM population at 24
hours after treatment. The decreasing trend of toxicity was fipronil > thiamethoxam = propoxur
>a-cypermethrin > DDVP. DDVP was the least toxic compound with highest LCso value (LCso=
1,978.69 ppm) while fipronil was the most toxic insecticide with lowest LCSo value (LCso = 15.65
ppm). It was observed that the toxicity of propoxur and thiamethoxam against B. germanica were
the same while toxicity of fipronil, DDVP, and a-cypermethrin were different from the rest of the
compounds based on overlapping of confidence interval.

Slope values based on concentration ~ mortality responses of B. germanica from BAYM
population to five insecticides were varied from 0.96-7.38. The response of B. germanica to DDVP
(the least effective insecticide) was the steepest slope (7.38) while response to fipronil (the most
effective insecticide) was the flattest slope (0.96) as shown in Figure 22. The steep slope on the
response of B. germanica to DDVP reflects the possible chance of the presence of resistance gene
developing in the population thus, decreasing genetic variation (Rosenheim and Hoy 1986). The
reduction in genetic variation might be due to prolonged used of DDVP or insecticides belonging
to organophosphate class resulting to artificial selection and eliminating susceptible individuals.
On the other hand, current status of the BAYM population reveals the mixed genotypic frequency
(both resistance gene and susceptible gene) present in German cockroach when tested to fipronil

showing large variance in the response. These data are informative for PCOs and individual urban

74

pesticide applicator for effective German cockroach control in decreasing the selection pressure.
The minimal use of DDVP and the shift to other insecticide class (e.g. phenyl pyrazole) can slow
down the rate of insecticide resistance.

BAYM collection site is a meat shop store in Bay Market (Table 7). Blattella germanica
population was abundant every collection trip of the student due to available food source and water
(e.g meat blood and meat carcasses). According to the market personnel, the current control of B.
germanica in the area is done by in-house pest control operators assigned by the market
administrator. The in-house pest control individuals used commercial insecticide containing
synthetic pyrethroids (cypermethrin 5%). This can be the reason for the less efficacy of a-

cypermethrin against German cockroaches from BAYM population

BAYS population (Site 8). From the eighth collection site, the toxicity of five insecticides
against German cockroach has the general trend of thiamethoxam= propoxur= fipronil = a-
cypermethrin > DDVP (Table 15). Based in LCso values, thiamethoxam was the most toxic (LCs0=
60.71 ppm) and DDVP was the least toxic (LCs0= 2,094.98 ppm). The toxicity of thiamethoxam
is not significantly different from propoxur, fipronil and a-cypermethrin based on confidence
interval.

The slope of concentration-mortality lines is an indication of the variation in response of
the organism, with a steep slope indicating a homogeneous population, and a flat line resulting
from a heterogeneous population (Kelly 1988). Slope values ranged from 1.41 to 5.75. These
responses may indicate that BAYS population of B. germanica are homogeneous to the selection

pressure provided by the five commercial toxicants. The response of B. germanica to DDVP was

7s

the steepest slope (5.75) while response to fipronil was the flattest (1.41) as shown in Figure 23.
This shows that response of B. germanica from the current population is more homogeneous to
DDVP but less homogeneous to fipronil. This reveals that current B. germanica population has
possible chance of the presence of resistance gene and artificially selected due to continued use of
chemicals belonging to organophosphate group; thus, decreasing genetic variation. However, the
current study cannot detect if the developing resistance gene is dominant, incompletely dominant
(or incompletely recessive), or recessive. Yu (2008) explained that when resistance gene is
recessive, the F2 progeny of the R x S (resistant and susceptible) cross will result to 25% resistant
population while 75% is susceptible population. However, if resistance gene is dominant, the F2
progeny of the R x S (resistant and susceptible) cross will result to 75% resistant population while
25% is susceptible population. The continuous selection pressure might result to difficulty in
cockroach control when all resistant individuals are present in the population. In practical
application, the PCOs and individual urban pesticide applicator can use these data for effective
German cockroach control by minimizing the use of DDVP or other related insecticide group. The
use of fipronil (which shows large variability in response) instead is recommended to slow down
the rate of insecticide resistance.

BAYS collection site is a sari-sari store located in the town of Bay (Table 7). No hired
PCO or in-house individual servicing the said establishment. The area is suitable harborage for the
German cockroaches due to availability of food sources (e.g.. damaged chicken eggs, rotten
smoked fish). To control the German cockroaches, the owner is dependent on the use of
commercial insecticides available in hardware or supermarket (personal communication). The

establishment currently use an attractant containing azamethiphos 0.005% as observed during

76

collection trip. The attractant is a cockroach killing bait in powder formulation and packed in
sachet form. The bait can be bought from the public market or online shopping platform. Although,
some testimonials said that it is more effective than products in aerosol spray formulation, it is not
registered with Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA even warned the public against
buying this unregistered product. Azamethiphos which is its active ingredient belongs to
organophosphates group of insecticide. Organophosphates were discovered in the early 1930s and
are still one of the largest families of insecticides. Even though their use is declining due to
regulatory action, organophosphates are still widely used because of their broad-spectrum activity.
flexibility in use and good residual characteristics (BASF 2013). The mode of action of
organophosphates is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) responsible for breaking down
the acetylcholine (ACh). This allows the ACh to continue stimulating the postsynaptic neuron
resulting to overstimulation of nervous system and eventual death of the targeted insect (IRAC
2019). In the current study, DDVP from the organophosphate class showed the least efficacy
against German cockroach from BAYS population. The tolerance of the German cockroach to
DDVP may be explained due to selection pressure from the currently used azamethiphos of same
mode of action. Qian et al. (2010), reported in their study that six-week-old nymphs German
cockroach were tolerant to dichlorvos. Other findings supported those insecticides belonging to
organophosphate family were not effective enough in the control of cockroaches (Kaakeh et

al.1997; Nasirian 2010).

BAYK population (Site 9). Table 16 shows the toxicity of five commercial insecticides

against six-week-old nymphs of Blattella germanica from BAYK population at 24 hours after

7

treatment. The decreasing trend is fipronil = thiamethoxam= propoxur > a-cypermethrin > DDVP.
Based on LCso values, fipronil was the most toxic (LCso= 28.45 ppm) but did not significantly
differ from thiamethoxam, and propoxur. On the contrary, DDVP was the least toxic
(LCso=2,501.44 ppm) against German cockroaches from BAYK population. Moreover, the
toxicity of fipronil, propoxur, and thiamethoxam against B. germanica were not significantly
different from each other based on confidence interval overlap test. Thus, response of B. germanica
coming from BAYK population were the same to three insecticides (fipronil, propoxur, a-
cypermethrin, and thiamethoxam) but significantly different to DDVP and a-cypermethrin.

For homogeneity response, slopes ranged from 0.95-5.79. Only slope value of fipronil
(0.95) was less than | indicating high heterogeneity response of B. germanica to this insecticide.
On the other hand, all four insecticides (DDVP, a-cypermethrin, thiamethoxam and propoxur)
showed variable homogeneous response of B. germanica, with DDVP having the steepest slope
(5.79) as presented in Figure 24. This implies that in genotypic level, resistance gene is present
that might be artificially selected through time and eliminating susceptible individual resulting to

the decrease in genetic variation particularly in DDVP. Consequently, large variance observed on

the response of German cockroach when tested to fipronil indicates the mixture of susceptible,
moderately resistant, and resistant individual present in the population. Having a wide range of
susceptibility is advantageous to select out more resistant individuals (Cochran 1995). With this
information, PCOs and other individual pesticide applicator can be informed to alternate their

choice of chemicals from organophosphate group to phenyl pyrazole which can help in slowing

down the rate of insecticide resistance in DDVP.

8

BAYK collection site is a food stall kitchen and does not avail the PCO servicing (Table
7). To manage the insect pests, sanitation and in-house control are utilized by spraying the
commercial insecticides which can be bought from the nearest hardware or supermarket. The food
stall presently utilizing aerosol spray containing mixture of 0.015% cyfluthrin and 0.05%
imiprothrin to control the German cockroaches. However, during the interview, the owner
volunteered that the insecticides they are currently using are becoming less effective. The results
of the bioassay tests confirm this observation. Insecticides containing fipronil and thiamethoxam
were never used by the said establishment. This could be the reason why German cockroaches
from this population were sensitive when exposed to fipronil and thiamethoxam producing lower
LCso values (26.422 ppm and 71.06 ppm respectively) compared to a-cypermethrin and DDVP.
Application of insecticidal baits is one of the effective strategies for controlling German
cockroach, Baits have become popular and effective formulation against urban insect pest
(Nasirian 2010). However, some are still using conventional pesticide due to the cheaper price like

this food stall kitchen (personal interview).

The ranking of the five insecticides against Blattella germanica based on LCso
values and confidence intervals is presented in Table 17. Among five insecticides tested from nine
populations where German cockroaches were collected, it was observed that fipronil was the most
effective and ranked {* from eight populations (except LBM). This result is expected since fipronil
from the phenyl pyrazole class of insecticide has not been used in the collection sites, being a new
addition to the chemical arsenal for cockroach control. Some studies have reported the highest
efficacy of fipronil against B. germanica compared to other commercial insecticides. Valles et al.
(1997) discussed that fipronil is sufficient to kill pre-resistant population even in nano-gram
quantity. Fipronil belongs to phenyl pyrazole family and discovered by Rhone-Poulenc in 1987.
Its mode of action is inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) gated chloride channel
leading to overstimulation and convulsion on affected insects (IRAC 2019). Fipronil has proven
to offer low dose, highly effective insect control against a broad range of pests. In household pest
control, there are various bait formulation containing fipronil as the main active ingredient.

According to Miller et al. (2005), baits have been claimed to be more consumer and environment-
friendly than insecticide sprays since they can be placed in precise location where cockroaches
habituate but inaccessible to people and pets.

Thiamethoxam was observed to be highly effective to B. germanica from six collection
sites, and as toxic as fipronil in five collection sites, viz., LBM, LBV, CALM1, CALC, BAYS,
and BAYK population. Thiamethoxam is also a relatively new compound and has not been used
in the nine collection sites. Low usage of thiamethoxam has increased its significance in
controlling urban pest effectively. Thiamethoxam belongs to neonicotinoids family of insecticide

and acts as agonists of acetyl choline receptors. Its mode of action is to mimic the action of

87

neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) resulting to continuous firing of impulse and overstimulation
of target insect pests (IRAC 2019). Similar to fipronil, insecticides containing thiamethoxam are
normally packed into bait formulation while others are in suspension concentrate formulation. In
the study of Fardisi et al. (2019), they reported that among the fourteen (14) active ingredients
(Als) of insecticide against field-collected German cockroach, thiamethoxam is one of the
compounds with lowest resistance level from Danville and Indianapolis. Moreover, in vial
bioassay test (Fardisi et al. 2017), less than 5% survivorship was achieved when laboratory strain
of Blattella germanica was exposed to any of the four Als such as abamectin, thiamethoxam,
lambda cyhalothrin and boric acid. Thiamethoxam is non-repellent and can be transferred from
exposed to unexposed insects that exhibit social behavior, such as ants and termites.

Propoxur, a carbamate insecticide, demonstrated toxicity against four collection sites
namely: CALMI, CALC, BAYS, and BAYK similar to fiproni! and thiamethoxam but was not as
effective as the first two compounds for the rest of the sites. Propoxur is not a new compound. It
was first introduced in the year 1959 with a fast knockdown and long residual effect against turf,
forestry, and household pests and fleas. However, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
has been reluctant to approve indoor use due to its potential toxicity to children after chronic
exposure. Vandekar et al. (1968) published the results of their studies carried out on spray
operators and local inhabitants in Iran when exposed to propoxur as part of WHO control program
It was reported that they suffered mild temporary cholinergic signs of poisoning such as headaches
and nausea due to heavy contamination of propoxur on the skin. In 1990s, propoxur was withdrawn
from indoor use and no longer available in the market in the US (Extension Toxicity Network

1996). In the current study, propoxur was still effective against the field-collected populations of

88

German cockroach. Lack of use and selection pressure may be the reason for the susceptibility of

these field-collected populations to this insecticide. The mode of action of carbamate insecticide

is inactivation of acetyl cholinesterase inhibiting this enzyme which is responsible for breaking

down acetylcholine (ACh) after it has carried its message across the synapse (IRAC 2019).

Siegfied and Scott (1991) reported that B. germanica exhibited high level of resistance to propoxur
via topical application compared to susceptible strain. They also indicated that resistance was due
to increased level of metabolism together with decreased rates of penetration. Gecheva (1991) first
reported the propoxur-resistant strain of German cockroach in Bulgaria. Meanwhile, propoxur’s
toxicity against B. germanica in this study is greater than a-cypermethrin.

The insecticide containing a-cypermethrin was second to the least effective insecticide
against B. germanica from eight populations but as toxic as fipronil, thiamethoxam and propoxur
in BAYS population. The reason may be due to frequent use of synthetic pyrethroids in almost all
collection areas either in aerosol form or suspension concentrate administered by in-house pest
control or just by do-it-yourself method in the contro! of German cockroach. Thus, increasing the
selection pressure to target organisms and resulting to possible tolerance exhibited by the insects.
Synthetic pyrethroids are sodium channel modulator. They are neurotoxins that act on action
potential sodium channel. Synthetic pyrethroids slow the closing and inactivation of the channel
causing it to remain open than normal. Thus, when action potential is not promptly terminated it
leads to repetitive firing in the insect’s nervous system (IRAC 2019). Various researchers have

reported the presence of high-level resistance in insects against pyrethroids and highlighted its

control failure incidence (Zhai and Robinson 1996; Lee et al. 1997; Lee 1998; Lee and Lee 2000).

Lee and Lee (2004) discussed that pyrethroids exhibit low to moderate level of resistance. Similar

89

conclusion has been made by Ahmad et al. (2009) and Nasirian et al. (2009) who reported that
resistance against pyrethroid have been developed in certain cockroach species. Consequently,
‘Choo et al. (2000) and Chai and Lee (2010) reported heavy resistance for pyrethroids (deltamethrin
and cypermethrin) against both German and American cockroaches.

The result of the present study revealed that DDVP was the least effective insecticide
against B. germanica from nine collection sites. This observation can infer that German cockroach
already produced tolerance and possible resistance to DDVP or to organophosphates class where
DDVP belongs. Organophosphates’ mode of action is the inactivation of acetyl cholinesterase
responsible for breaking down of acetylcholine (ACh) resulting to continuous stimulation of
postsynaptic neuron leading to overstimulation of the nervous system and eventual death of the
affected insect (IRAC 2019). According to Kaakeh et al. (1997) and Syed et al. (2014),
organophosphates are not effective enough to combat susceptible and resistant population of
cockroaches. Organophosphate acted as neurotoxic agent against cockroaches, however in this
study, this compound did not come up with satisfactory result. This class is less favored by pest
control industries nowadays due to its strong odor than pyrethroids, but good residual efficacy
DDVP was already used by urban pest control operators against German cockroaches since 1980s
until now. Even after four decades, some PCOs prefer the use of DDVP due to its cheaper price
(personal communication). This may be the reason why DDVP was the least effective among the
five insecticides tested. Although DDVP has same mode of action as propoxur
(acetylcholinesterase inhibitors), the current study reveals differential responses of the nine
populations to the two compounds. The reduced toxicity of DDVP against nine populations of

German cockroach compared to highly toxic propoxur for 50% of the populations was observed

90

in this study. This can be explained due to the prolonged rate of binding of organophosphate
compound to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which may take days or even weeks compared to
propoxur. Thus, insecticides belonging to organophosphates group are generally regarded as
imeversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase. On the other hand, intoxication of carbamate
insecticides is subject to its instantaneous unbinding to acetylcholinesterase (AChE), typically in
minutes, and therefore regarded as reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The same result was
observed by Wu and Appel (2017) and reported that field-collected strains of B. germanica were
resistant to organophosphate (chlorpyrifos) while nearly no resistance to carbamate (propoxur)
when resistance ratio was compared to susceptible strain.

The prolonged selection pressure exhibited by organophosphate may have induced tolerant
genes in the German cockroach from each collection site, thus less effectivity to target organism.
The long residual life of a chemical can prolong the selection pressure in the particular area thus,

resulting to insecticide resistance (Georgiou 1980). Studies on insecticide resistance as follow up

to the current susceptibility study are highly desirable for better understanding of the insecticide
resistance of the German cockroach.

For studies of insecticide resistance, a susceptible strain of the German cockroach is
necessary. At first, LBV and CALC populations were inferred to be possible sources of this
susceptible strain due to no record of chemical control applied based on initial interview. However,
bioassay results showed consistently high LCs values for DDVP. moderate LCs» values for a-

cypermethrin in most populations and low LCs» values for fipronil or thiamethoxam in some

populations. Thus, it can be inferred that there is no susceptible strain in the nine test populations.

91

Results obtained from the conducted bioassays can be used in considering an appropriate
insecticide for PCOs as well as in household use. Fipronil and thiamethoxam — the two most
effective insecticides against German cockroach in most collection sites can be a replacement to

older classes of insecticides and most especially to DDVP. With the application of these new

findings, together with evidence-based decisions may ensure that effective insecticides are selected

and used for an effective German cockroach control.

SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

The contact toxicity and insecticidal potency of five commercial insecticides were
evaluated against Blattella germanica collected from the town of Los Baftos, Calamba and Bay,
Laguna. From each town, three collection sites were used for a total of nine collection sites of
gravid female B. germanica, The field-collected B. germanica were maintained in the laboratory,
reared the F: nymphs until they reached six-week-old and conducted the bioassay tests using the
WHO jar test method with some modifications. All primary data were obtained after the 24hr

observation of each bioassay test.

Fipronil solely ranked as the most toxic against German cockroach collected from three
populations (viz. LBK, CALM2, BAYM), while thiamethoxam was the most toxic in LBM. Both
insecticides shared same toxicity against B. germanica from LBV population. This is because both
are relatively newer compounds and were not used for German cockroach control either in gel bait
formulation or sprayable in the nine collection sites. Fipronil and thiamethoxan are examples of
active ingredients packed in minimal amount in some gel baits. Propoxur was not as toxic
compared to abovementioned compounds from five collection sites but demonstrated same toxicity
with fipronil and thiamethoxam to four German cockroach populations (viz. CALMI, CALC,
BAYS, and BAYK). Except in the case of BAYM population, propoxur exhibited more potency
to a-cypermethrin. The reduced toxicity of a-cypermethrin was evident in the study. The reason
might be due to frequent use of almost all collection areas of synthetic pyrethroids either in aerosol
spray or in concentrate formulation in controlling the German cockroach. DDVP was the least

toxic commercial insecticide against B. germanica from nine collection sites. DDVP from

93

organophosphate group of insecticide was long used by those in pest control industry. This shows
that the older classes (organophosphates) which have been used through time have reduced
efficacy against German cockroach compared to the newer compounds.

It is recommended that owners and staff of the selected establishments should practice
cleanliness and modification of environment by eliminating water, food and shelter needed by
German cockroaches before doing chemical application. With this, frequent application of
insecticides would be reduced, lessening the selection pressure. It is also recommended to staff
and owners of establishments to refrain from using DDVP or compounds belonging to
organophosphate class of insecticide due to their being less effective against nine populations of
German cockroach based on the current study. The continual use of older class of insecticides

(DDVP) although cheaper, can result to ineffective control of B. germanica, thus higher cost and

labor intensive. On the contrary, the use of more expensive yet more effective insecticides mean
less maintenance work visits for assigned PCOs in an establishment. Considering the fixed rate for
their service based on the agreed contract, this may reduce their operational cost and add up to
their profit as described in Appendix 2. The FDA website is a helpful tool in choosing newer
compounds available in the market which are more efficacious even at lower dose.

For the market administrator, monitoring and regulation of the pesticides used by the in-
house PCOs as well as their pest control performance must be done. Prior to the purchase of

pesticides, the local government unit (LGU) must require the updated certificate of product

registration (CPR) issued by FDA from agrochemical suppliers to ensure the safe and effective

pesticides against German cockroach. Currently, private owners of commercial establishments

such as fast-food chains, restaurants, hotels, and factories require first the CPR and material safety

94

data sheet (MSDS) from the hired pest control operators as part of their initial agreement and used
upon their contract renewal.

For the pesticide applicator (professional or non-professional), knowledge on the active
ingredient will be a good guide in understanding the mode of action (MoA) of a toxicant against
the target organism. The Insecticide Resistance Action Commitiee’s (IRAC) MoA classification
scheme is another helpful tool in knowing the up-to-date information of the MoA of new and
established insecticides and acaricide control. To delay the insecticide resistance build-up of B.
germanica, one must employ the rotation of chemical use from one class or family to another with
different mode of action.

The set of baseline data on the current susceptibility status of Blattella germanica on five

commercially available insecticide can improve on decision makit

in urban pest control industry.
This can be a good guide in selecting most potent chemicals for effective control measures of the
Blattella germanica, Moreover, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) or the holistic and coordinated
approach in tackling the problem on German cockroach can also reduce selection pressure and is

a must for every pest control operator.
